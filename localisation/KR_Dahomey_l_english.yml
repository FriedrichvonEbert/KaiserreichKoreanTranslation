 dah.002.d:0 "Our military is young, and lacks much of the basic equipment that an army needs, guns especially. One way we could make up for this deficiency is to ask one of the major powers (except those blasted Germans) to sell us some guns. Should we go ahead with this?"

 dah.005.t:0 "Our Place In The Wider World"
 dah.005.d:0 "Before the days of African colonisation, we were a free and self-sufficient people. No one could keep us from being strong, proud, and free. Nowadays though, the world is a much bigger place, with many actors far larger than us. We are thus forced to consider our place in the world. Will we become a subject of France once more? Or perhaps we should go free, and take our chances there? Or do we sit back and allow events to develop before making this choice?"
