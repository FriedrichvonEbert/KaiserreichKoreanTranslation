 hawaii.118.d:0 "After consulting his advisors, [FROM.GetLeader] has declined our request of reuniting with continental America, citing political instability as the prime reason. As one of the many American possessions whose control had been lost during the American Civil War, the reunion of Hawaii with America will undoubtedly bring much needed legitimacy to the owner of the White House, rendering Hawaii as only a political tool and not seen with true equality within the legislature or the administration. \n \nWhile we may respect their decision and refuse a reunion, a notable portion of the Hawaiian population would undoubtedly prefer being under the same umbrella as the whole of America.

 HAW_DELOS_EMMONS_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L January 17, 1889, in Huntington, West Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Delos Carleton Emmons graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1909 as a second lieutenant. He was assigned as the CO of the Company B of the 30th Infantry Regiment, and would follow the 30th until July 1916, where he was promoted to first lieutenant and joined the Signal Corps to become an aviator. He became a Captain by July 1917, a Major in June 1918 and a Colonel in August 1918. He'd transfer to the US Army Air Service in 1920, and in 1921 he completed the Air Service Course at Harvard University. He'd hold several influential posts in the US Army Air Service during the twenties, and would graduate from the Air Corps Tactical School and the Command and General Staff School before 1930. He was assigned to Hawaii in March 1934 as the CO of the 18th Composite Wing and he has held that post until the outbreak of the American Civil War. With the local tensions high, and seeing the writing on the wall, Delos decided to join the revolt against the Federal Government which helped proclaim an independent Hawaii. This has granted him the promotion to Brigadier General, but it is uncertain if he's actually prepared for the job.\n§YImportant Notes:§L- He is known to have made racist displays against Japanese-Americans in the island, citing the possibility of a Japanese attack on the island."
 HAW_BARNEY_HAJIRO_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L September 16, 1916, in Hawaii, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§L Barney Fushimi Hajiro was born from a Japanese immigrant family residing in Hawaii, and he enlisted in the army in 1934. Since then, he has performed remarkably well in the officer courses, and the outbreak of the Civil War has made the lack of capable officers in Hawaii a dire issue, prompting a premature promotion for Hajiro to the status of General. While he is a capable officer, he's been granted too much power and responsibility for a man of his experience, and it's uncertain if he'll be able to keep up...\n§YImportant Notes:§L- Holds a deep grudge against Emmons due to Emmons discrimination of Japanese-American Citizens."
 HAW_ROBERT_RICHARDSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L October 27, 1882, in Charleston, South Carolina\n§YMilitary Career:§L Robert Charlwood Richardson Jr. graduated from West Point as a second lieutenant in 1904, and was a member of the 14th Cavalry Regiment during the Philippine War guerrilla insurrections, where he personally fought against hostile Moros tribesmen. During one skirmish against the tribesmen, he was wounded in combat, for which he was awarded the Purple heart and the Silver Star. He'd continue to fight with his regiment until October 1905, where he returned to San Francisco. He led the 14th Cavalry during the 1906 earthquake as a part of the government response to the disaster. In October 1906, he rejoined West Point as an Assistant Instructor in Foreign Languages until 1911, where he rejoined the 14th Cavalry for a second tour in the Philippines. He'd return again to the US in 1914, and served as Assistant Professor of English in West Point until 1917, where he was sent to France as an observer for the dying Entente. His observations in France were quite valuable for the US Military Academy, and once the defeat of France became imminent, he was recalled back to the US. He was ascended to Captain in 1920, and after signing up for a third tour in the Philippines, he became a Major. He was later sent to the Republic of Italy as a military attaché during the conflicts that shaped the region and would return as a lieutenant colonel in 1928, where he'd rejoin his beloved 13th Cavalry once more at Fort Riley in Kansas. He'd be rotated as commanding officer throughout many regions of the United States, until he promoted and assigned to Hawaii in early 1936. While he's one of the most experienced members of the staff, his loyalty to Hawaii itself isn't really solid as there seems to have been a struck of luck for Richardson to be spared the chaos that now ravages the mainland when he actually has no connections to the island."

McNarney served with the 21st Infantry Regiment at Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and with the 37th Infantry Regiment at Yuma, Arizona. He became one of the first lieutenants to begin flight training when he signed up to the Signal Corps Aviation School in 1916, from where he'd graduate a year later as a Junior Military Aviator. He was promoted to Captain in May 1917 and posted in New Mexico. He'd later take charge of the flying school at Gerstner Field, in Luisiana. He'd move in late 1920 to Langley Field, where he became a student of the Air Service Field Officers School and remained in Langley as an instructor. He'd graduate with honours from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in 1926, and he completed the Army War College course in 1930. He succeeded Major Spaatz in the 7th Bomb group after Spaatz promotion. McNarney then became an instructor at the Army War College in Washington, serving from August 1933 to March 1935, where he was redeployed as an attaché to Canada. With the outbreak of the Civil War, McNarney decided that it was best to leave to a place where his particular skills were in short supply, and the Hawaiian staff was more than happy to welcome him from Canada."
