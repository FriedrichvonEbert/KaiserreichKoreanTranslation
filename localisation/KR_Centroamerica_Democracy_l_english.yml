The dream of our nations unified under a democracy formed from each member nation is now no longer a remnant of the past. However, there is still a long way to go. As our territorial extension has grown significantly, our government has decided to delegate the executive power of the newly formed nation to the Central American Constitutional Convention until the new parties reorganise to take into account the newly acquired territories, and will decide upon the fate of the Central American Confederation once the parties with most members present themselves in the convention."

Having prepared for the unification of Central America for years, they have been the first party to present itself to the convention, and has taken over power temporarily until the other parties organise and the convention regarding the direction the country should take is held.\n\nPresided by the Guatemalan politician José Perfecto Azmitia González, the Unionist Party follows a conservative mindset and has already stated in their manifesto that their objective is to carry the Confederation to a more usual form of Republic and to create a Central American identity, that encompasses all the cultures within Central America. They also reject the intervention of foreigners in national affairs, and this might spell the end of the UFC influence in the country..."

The meeting, held in the Honduran city of Tegucigalpa, has united the many free-market liberals that feel antagonised by the autarkical proposals of Sacasa, and have released a manifesto regarding the policies they are willing to pursue. Among them, cooperation with foreign companies like the UFC and to open Central American trade to the world. However, they claim they don't want to rely on any specific foreign power, as they see this as one of the reasons why Central America was thrown into chaos when the United States fell into the fires of Civil War.\n\nUnfortunately, not all issues have been solved during the meeting, as a faction lead by the Honduran undisputed face of liberalism, José Ángel Zúñiga, faces off opposition from a faction lead by the Nicaraguan José María Moncada. In order to solve to proclaim a party leader, the Democratic Unification Party has decided to call for an internal election amongst affiliates, and the winner will lead the party in the upcoming elections."

The Liberals, promising economic independence for Central America and to move away from the old agricultural export-based economy towards an industrial based one. Despite this premise, they have stated that they are more than willing to cooperate with foreign companies in order to achieve this goal, which has eased unrest amongst foreign investors, particularly from the United Fruit Company that feared that their assets might be seized."

Amongst the many changes that the Labour Party wants to bring about to the confederation is the establishment of some form of welfare state, a land reform and the creation of a middle class, which is nearly non-existent in our country.\n\nHowever, despite bringing together many parties from different countries, it is unclear who shall lead the party during the elections, as orthodox social democracy, represented by the faction lead by Francisco Sequeira Moreno, clashes with many who follow Arturo Araujo's 'Vitalismo', a variant of Social Democracy created by the Salvadorian politician Alberto Masferrer. Elections for party affiliates have been called and the winner will represent the party in the convention and during the next elections."

No consensus could be made over which city should the convention be held, so the city of San Salvador was eventually chosen as its geographic location was near the centre of the Confederation, the city had the infrastructure to held large scale political demonstrations and it was also the symbolical place for Central American independence, as it was the place where the Primer Grito de la Independencia came to be. As the delegations arrive, proposals come forth regarding what the Confederation should look like in the near future, and the convention members have the duty to decide what shall be the future of the country."

 cendem.7.d:0 "Before the convention decides on any matter regarding the constitution, it has been deemed wise by the Unionistas to start the constitutional convention by discussing what will be done with the radicals that set out to destroy democracy in Central America. While it is clear that the death penalty is out of the question by all members of the convention, they still need to decide on a fitting punishment for the radicals. The PUD has proposed to exile the leaders and any who doesn't recognise the Federal government as legitimate, which is seen as the most lenient solution, but one that lets many criminals just walk freely. The Unionistas simply propose to imprison them for the rest of their life, which, while being a rather simple solution, could pose danger for our nation in case of a breakout. The Partido del Trabajo, on the other hand, has offered a proposal where the criminals can be imprisoned, but they can choose to work in improvised construction squads, which shall be vital during the reconstruction and improvement of our country, in exchange for reduced sentence times. Before the Convention moves forward, this matter will have to be settled, for the sake of the short term stability of our nation."

However, Unionistas argue that a strong executive power is needed to held the confederation in place, as the ineffective rule of the previous Confederation was what led to its eventual dissolution. After several days of debate, the convention members are once again ready to vote on the matter."

While the convention could install a constitutional supremacy clause in the document, rendering all local legislation useless if it contradicts the constitution, the Partido del Trabajo representatives argue that it would reduce the provincial autonomy to a dangerous level while empowering the Federal Government. Instead, they propose to use the constitution as a guideline for the local legislations, which shall operate freely as long as they respect some core tenants of the Federal Constitution.

It is recognised by all parties that a national security force is needed in order to secure our sovereignty, but each party has a different approach towards the armed forces. The Unionistas have proposed a Federal Army, subordinated to the Federal executive power and with a section under the direct control of the President, which would try to strive for professionalism and superior tactics where it was possible. The Partido del Trabajo has come up with a different proposal, aiming to create regional army structures, similar to those from before our nation was formed, they propose a confederation with individual armies which would come together in case of war, but would otherwise have very little executive power and be subjected to each province's executive power rather than the federal government. The Partido Unificación Demócratica has offered a middle ground, with a federal army backed by regional militias, similar to the system that Brazil has with their army.

His mortal remains are being the object of numerous tributes by the Partido Unionista and the many citizens of our nation who wanted reunification before our nations were finally one once again. He will now be buried in the General Cemetery of Guatemala City under the flag of Unionism, but his death is not the end of the Unionistas. They have called for a new internal election to designate a successor for Azmitia and the two main candidates, Guatemalan Julio Domingo Bianchi Smout and Nicaraguan Emiliano Chamorro Vargas, have already presented their proposals for the future of the party. While Bianchi wants to continue the legacy of Azmitia, Chamorro wants to reform the Unionistas into a more traditional conservative party, and it is time for the party members to decide what shall be the future of the Partido Unionista."

 CEN_DEM_no_more_evasion_desc:0 "Surprisingly, tax evasion in Central America is one of the greatest losses of capital that our government has, and now that we have begun to create a welfare state, that capital would come really handy to improve our budget.

 CEN_DEM_Artillery_Corps_desc:0 "With our system, we cannot depend on a number advantage to beat the enemy. Luckily, one of the greatest inventions in the 20th century for warfare has been artillery, which allows us to pound enemy positions from relative safety as long as we can outrange the enemy's artillery.

 CEN_DEM_combined_arms:0 "Combined Arms Training"
