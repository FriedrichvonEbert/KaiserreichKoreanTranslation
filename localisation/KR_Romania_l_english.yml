 ROM_mountain_hunters_desc:0 "The \"Vanatori\", or Hunters, were formed in 1917, modelled after the French Chasseurs Alpin in response to Austria-Hungary's elite Kaiserschützen.

 ROM_the_king_ferdinand_desc:0 "A proper flagship for the Romanian Navy has been envisioned for quite some time, but never made reality. This dream must be made a reality as we become a serious power in the Black Sea. Considering our capabilities and limitations, a cruiser will certainly do."
 ROM_black_sea_dominance:0 "Royal Navy of the Black Sea"
 ROM_black_sea_dominance_desc:0 "The Black Sea is one of the major economic artery for our nation; seeking to achieve supremacy over it is merely natural to protect our interests.

 ROM_king_under_surveillance:0 "King Under Surveillance"
 ROM_king_under_surveillance_desc:0 "While the institution of the monarchy is respectable, it is clear that it must be kept from intervening too much within our affairs. By making sure that vital court offices are always staffed by our men, we can reduce the king's manoeuvring room enough that he will have no choice but to cooperate. If the king is the symbol of the nation, he must not stand in the path of its will, as embodied by us."

 ROM_tradition_eternal_desc:0 "It is not our way to recklessly send our men dashing into danger, as losing the cream of our crop would only weaken our strength just like what happened at Nicopole or at Crecy all those years ago.

 ROM_agrarian_price_controls:0 "Agrarian Price Controls"
 ROM_agrarian_price_controls_desc:0 "The market, while an useful tool to attain great wealth for our nation, can also be an unyielding malefactor for our poor, who can end up having to resort to bartering or subsistence farming to get the foodstuff they need.

 ROM_numerus_valachicus_desc:0 "Our country's university system has a worrying proportion of non-Romanian students. In the past, our student population had grown weary of this perceived intrusion, lighting up the spark that would lead to our movement's founding.

 ROM_court_the_king_desc:0 "His Majesty reportedly was aghast when he heard of our election victory, and considering the troubles that led to this peculiar situation, he cannot be blamed. However, to avoid the troubles we had with the last king, Carol II, we should at least try to play nice with His Majesty; if it seems like we try to uphold democracy in some way, the chances of being ousted early will decrease accordingly."

There is, however, an expectation of discretion: scandals are to be avoided and liaisons terminated should such a scandal occur. The king, however, not only appears to have no discretion whatsoever; indeed, he seems to take great pleasure in publicly flaunting his womanising lifestyle.\n\nThe origins of Elena \"Magda\" Lupescu are a source of confusion and debate. It is known that she inherited her Catholicism through her mother, who is a Jewish-born convert; her father, also Jewish-born, is an apothecary who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. She was briefly married to a certain Lieutenant Ion Tampeanu, but divorced some time after the war. It is not known when she met the king, but she only started appearing alongside him after he was crowned and she quickly became one of his closest advisors.\n\nThe king has long been known as a playboy, but he has been acting differently with this recent mistress. Unlike his previous affairs, the relationship appears very strong, giving Magda significant, and apparently lasting, influence within Carol's inner circle.

The Jewish origins of her parents are emphasised to further demonise her in the eyes of an increasingly anti-Semitic public and place her as a centrepiece of an anti-Romanian conspiracy.

While Codreanu has made little effort to hide his disgust of the mistress, he and the king depend on an image of cooperation in their common goal to forge Greater Romania and the incident threatens to expose how bitterly opposed they truly are.

On the other hand, we could let the Iron Guard win this round and save our breath for another, more important, battle.

He was in many ways the very example of the Legionary his Captain desired: radical, bold and staunchly nationalistic. However, he had gathered his share of enemies during his fast promotion through the ranks of the Guard into becoming one of Codreanu's lieutenants. As such many within the Legion are at least suspicious of the young leader, and some even doubt his loyalty to the Captain. Regardless, the whispers are enough to have gotten the attention of Royalist agents who are more than eager to exploit any cracks in the seemingly-monolithic Iron Guard."

It is not clear whether it is from envy, ambition or idealism, but the young man and his followers have broken off from the main Legionary Movement in a very high-profile event. Stelescu has announced his plans of founding a movement of his own he calls Vulturii Albi, the White Eagles.\nStelescu's splinter movement, while still very nationalist and radical, calls for social reforms such as 8-hour work day and decent minimum wages. These ideas have brought many to question the group's true colours, and many prominent Legionnaires are openly accusing Stelescu for being a lapdog for international Jewish-Socialist conspiracy. The White Eagles in turn have criticised the main movement harshly of betraying the working class Romanians.\nStelescu's splinter movement is already being branded apostates by many prominent Legionnaires, and the Captain needs to decide soon how to deal with the crisis within the movement."

It is now time to decide the king's fate.\n\nOn one hand, the king's weakened position could be advantageous. Keeping him under house arrest after transferring his powers to Codreanu would ensure that he would only have to deal with a feeble, familiar threat that he can easily be rid of should the need arise. Otherwise, Carol should be forced to abdicate, leaving his place to the young Crown Prince Mihai.

Representing the left-wing, his platform is centred around the \"Community of Producers\", supporting cooperative farming and the dominance of labour over capital.\n\nIuliu Maniu was one of the leaders of the PNR and is seen as leading the centre of the new party with a platform focusing on class collaboration and corporatism.\n\nAlexandru Vaida-Voevod was the other big name of the PNR and maintains a more conservative approach with the party's right-wing. His platform is economically-driven, focusing on regional development and national stability.\n\nThe three leaders, at their core, support a more decentralised approach compared to the centralism of the National Liberals and the Legion, mixed economic policies, and parliamentary democracy."

However, in order to avoid controversy, as the PNL has long been accused of being monopolised by the Bratianu family, they have been largely relegated to minor positions despite their unwavering support of the party. While Dinu is largely remaining quiet over the issue, Gheorghe has become increasingly agitated over it and has been rallying other dissidents within the party behind him.

While the main signatory of the treaty, Alexandru Marghiloman, would become quickly ostracised by the Nation, Averescu would be showered with praise, becoming Marshal of Romania in 1927.

A career officer, his outstanding service life began as a cadet in 1868, rising through the ranks as a skilled staff officer (something extremely valuable at the time) before further studying at the prestigious military academy at Saint-Cyr. He would become highly-distinguished during the Second Balkan War as a Brigadier General and he would be quickly promoted afterwards. By the time Romania declared war on the Central Powers, Prezan commanded the First Army, securing Romania's few offensive victories of the war. This success saw him further promoted to Chief of Staff after the fall of Bucharest, where he would organise Romania's successful defence of Moldavia from General Mackensen's combined Central Powers force. With the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest, Prezan opted to retire, remaining aloof from the unstable post-war situation. Nevertheless, his superb abilities were recognised despite the defeat and he would be honoured with a marshal's baton in 1930 while his advice was highly-sought, remaining a quiet privy councillor to the king.\n\nThe venerable marshal will receive a proper state funeral with full military honours expected of Romania's heroes.

Orthodox clerics on both sides of the Carpathians have expressed their appreciation towards this increase of status, bringing up the status of Bulgaria and that of Serbia as an example for why Romania should finally have its own patriarchy. Supportive voices from other denominations have also risen, most proeminently that of Greek Catholic Bishop of Cluj-Gherla Iuliu Hossu.\n\nNow the last remaining issue is to choose the first Patriarch of an United Romania, and three candidates have reached a particular level of notability. The first is incumbent Metropolitan-Primate of Ungrovlahia Vartolomeu Stanescu, although he hasn't expressed much of a preference in the matter, saying that it is up to God whether he is chosen or not, and that if he isn't he would retreat to a monastery to live out his last days in peace, his metropolitanate having been very taxing. Another candidate is Nicodim Munteanu, Metropolitan of Moldova, whose firm stance on syndicalism has earned him many sympathies in the country. Finally, as a show of unity, we could elect the incumbent Metropolitan of Transylvania, Nicolae Balan, who has shown himself to be a very careful teacher to his flock and grew to be very respected, in addition to being very interested in the education of Transylvanian Romanians and national unity.

There he meets Otilia Marculescu, the man's stepdaughter, alongside his uncle's sister's family, the Tulea's- and family friend Leonida Pascalopol. Felix gradually falls in love with Otilia, who unfortunately doesn't fully return his feelings, showing some preference for Pascalopol instead. All the while, in spite of loving his stepdaughter in his own way, Giurgiuveanu is reticent to fully adopt her and make her a main beneficiary of his inheritance, resulting in a conflict where he has to deal with the Tulea family and their quest to seize control of his fortune, be it via inheritance or other means. After a surprising trip to Paris on Otilia's behalf, an affair with a courtesan on Felix's end, and the Tulea schemes to seize Costache's fortune, the two youths meet each other again, but in spite of tension do not take the final leap. Eventually, a Tulea kinsman manages to steal Giurgiuveanu's wealth, who dies from a shock-induced heart attack, and Otilia ends up marrying Pascalopol and leaving for Paris again. After the war, Felix meets Pascalopol again, who reveals that he and Otilia got divorced, the latter remarrying and moving to Buenos Aires, becoming unrecognisable to her former admirer.\n\nPortraying a modernist outlook on antebellum Bucharest bourgeoisie, coupled with themes of paternity, coming of age, and unrequited love it is selling surprisingly well. Reviews are positive, and critics foresee a brilliant career for Mr. Calinescu."

Though the flame of nationalism is still ablaze, it appears that the desire for expansionism has been finally sated.

With the German economic crisis, even more of the treaty's provisions started to be skirted or openly ignored, and now, with the outbreak of the Second Weltkrieg, the powers that be have seen it fit to finally proclaim the end of the humiliating treaty.

Codreanu's highly personalistic, circulary-focused and one-on-one contact-oriented leadership style has begun to falter, in spite of attempts to temper the growing zeal of his recruits. Tightening ranks, enforcing waits and probation periods between joining the Party and the Legion proper, a lot was attempted to try and temper the ballooning Iron Guard's growth and effervescence.\n\nYet, it was not enough. Many radicals across the various factions of the movement have begun to grow discontented with the "parliamentarisation" of the movement, and began to yearn for the earlier days of the Guard, when it was more militant and combative. The decline of revanchism also began to hit the Legionaries' odds by reducing the wellsprings they could tap into for support. Recent setbacks have weakened movement's unity even further and the factions that used to work together have begun to openly rally against each other. These factors, and more, have led to its own control over its own members beginning to fray at the edges, and now, it is beginning to snap.\n\nMany have begun to leave, others began to form splinter groups, and in general the once-mighty behemoth of the Iron Guard has begun to collapse under its own weight. While still a force to be reckoned with, at least in the near future, it will not reach the same prominence it once had, and it is theorised it will begin falling into the same downward spiral its predecessor, the LANC, once fell in."

Containing a collection of Mota's most important articles on varying issues, from the origins of the Legion among nationalist studentry to the necessity of Greater Hungary's dismantlement, all the way to the mundane like miracles attributed to the Archangel Michael. Acting as a microcosm of Legionary beliefs, especially of its "old guard" agraro-mysticist side, the book has become very popular among Legionary circles, strengthening the reach of the so-called "Old Guard"."

Building upon his speeches of past student congresses like Romanul de maine (The Romanian of Tomorrow), he also compares the varying ideological systems of Totalism, Kemalism, Savinkovism, the Volkish movement and Balbian National Populism, as well as discussing Dostoyevsky, Berdyaev, Barrès and Jaurès. While he does acknowledge some similarities between the goals of Syndicalism and the Legionary Movement (namely, rejecting the nineteenth century's liberal tradition, abolishing social injustice, bank feudalism, privileges and capital speculations), he also sharply differentiates the movement from the Syndicalists in that they are considered worshippers of Marx, Proudhon and Pouget, builders of a second Tower of Babel who try to replace Christianity with atheism. Cantacuzino also considers that the Syndicalists are inhumane, annihilating the individual's personality and considering him as a means to an end, while Legionarism instead cares for their fellow peers and their physical and spiritual health, while also nurturing them and preparing the nation to "stand at the borders of Romanianism, ready to defend and elevate the creations of the Romanian genius to the death", an "internal revolution" against a "mechanical society".\n\nThe volume has proven to be a success among the Movement, giving further influence and intellectual backing to its radical caucus, with its emphasis on palingenetic rhetoric in the detriment of the mysticist element having further solidified Cantacuzino's standing as a Legionary theorist, and widened the intellectual horizon of the movement."

While he can reign in the Legionaries that are close to him, those further from the central reach may be more vulnerable to subversion and may get unsavoury ideas, to say nothing of the fact these new doctrinary evolutions jeopardise the ideals of the original founders' struggle.

I know that Our Lord Jesus Christ faced worse hardships on the Road of Golgotha, and I acknowledge that before His suffering, my woes are petty; but having to divide my attention like that is proving too hard for me."\n"I see. You want someone to take away the bitter chalice, just as our Lord prayed in the Gospels."\n"Yes; and that someone must be you. You have been my right hand all along, fought and suffered with me and the movement through thick and thin. I have noticed that your writings and those inspired by our Vacaresti days have become influential, and you have taken very well to the responsibilities of governance during my time as President of the Council of Ministers."\nMota paused for a second.

"I have. Having to handle both the Movement and the Country at the same time is proving taxing, and I would like to divest myself of some of the burden.

Namely, that the Legion's popularity is undermining it. The more members that sign up, the more they have to be kept in check to follow Codreanu's strict standards, a task that has to be balanced with actually ruling the country. Altough attempts are made to control this phenomenon via probation periods and limiting the number of people allowed to ascend into the Legion proper from the “outer Party”, the influx is slowly fraying its Captain’s capacity of maintaining his hold.\n\nThis member influx has also proven conductive to the development of factions within the Legion’s ranks, with three “strains” of thought becoming the most relevant: the “Old Guard”, standard-bearers of the early days’ student mysticism and agrarian populism, centred on Legion co-founder Ion Mota; the “Legionary Workers’ Corps”, geared more towards urban worker interests and having a more social-revolutionary leaning and centred around LWC leader Gheorghe Clime and Transylvanian organiser Horia Sima; and finally, the radicals, who combine elements of established Legionary thought with parts of other National-Populist ideologies, especially the ANI in the Italian Republic, with this group being centred on Legionary rising star and firebrand Alexandru Cantacuzino.\n\nAs the Legion heads towards ever greater heights, it remains to be seen if one of these strands of thought will become dominant or if its Captain will once more achieve the seemingly-impossible and re-center the movement around his leadership."

In a speech, the foreign minister of Romania has pledged to safeguard the island’s traditions, announcing that the King himself has taken interest in the island and will visit it soon enough; an event said by some islanders to be foretold in a dream."

From now on, you will have back your privileges, and all my care.” and formally restored the island’s privileges of customs tax and conscription exemption. A local company owned by Ali Kadri was granted a license to import luxury goods including tobacco, coffee, sugar, alcohol and cigarettes, with the tobacco and cigarette license being especially significant owing to the existence of the state monopoly on tobacco. An arrangement was also codified into Romanian law where half the company’s profits were assigned for the upkeep and modernisation of the island, with the other half divided out equally as a small subsidy to every one of its residents.

There, a religious ceremony was held, after which the royal entourage headed towards the Royal Palace, where, after being congratulated by various diplomats and holding a speech, Nicolae put the Steel Crown on his own head, before crowning his wife with the Crown of Queen Elisabeta. The following days are scheduled to host military reviews and parades by representants of the counties of Romania, with the festivities slated to culminate with another coronation at Alba Iulia.\n\nAlongside the King, many high-ranking members of the Legionary Movement could be seen, many of whom had a veneer of satisfaction as they watched the ceremony unfold.

As Codreanu is for now focused more on the Old Kingdom, whomsoever gets control over the vast and growing Transylvanian chapters will become very influential within the Movement as a whole. A host of CML-aligned members of the Committee of the Thousand have proposed granting Horia Sima, a regional organiser in the Banat area who has made overtures to the group in the past, control over the Transylvanian chapters, citing his experience in organising the West. The Legionary Senate however, more influenced by the Old Guard, has proposed continuing Mota’s tenure, citing his incumbency and his vital role in setting up the Transylvanian organisations. Of course, the Captain could also try to satisfy both and grant Mota control over the inner Transylvanian chapters and Sima control over the West, reducing the chances of an unified Transylvanian bloc emerging and safeguarding his own influence in the process."

Due to having almost free reign in spreading their view of Legionary ideology across the Carpathians, the share of Legionary members adhering to the Old Guard’s tenets of agrarian populism tinged with heavily Orthodox mysticism-inspired rhetoric has dramatically grown. While Mota is loyal to his brother-in-law, he and other members of this caucus have become emboldened, and their likeliness to talk back to Codreanu over decisions he wants to make has grown accordingly"

While the other groups still have adherents beyond the mountains, many urban centers of Transylvania seem poised to become LWC strongholds.

While a relatively small organisation and nowhere near as efficient as the state intelligence service, it nevertheless helps ensure internal cohesion among the movement’s ranks. With the expansion of Legionary power and influence however, many members, especially those affiliated with the radical caucus, want to expand its capacities, turning it into a full-fledged auxiliary of the SSI – Serviciul Special de Informatii; the Special Informations Service-, to be led by Horia Cosmovici, protege of Sima and Cantacuzino. Other voices within the movement, including the SIMLR’s current leader, Ion Belgea, clamour that tangling with the SSI would only result in bureaucratic tanglings and would hamper its efficiency, and that if the SSI were to be roused, it could undermine us from its very lofty position."

Supporters consider that this will further strengthen the Movement’s power and will be of use towards achieving the Legionary Victory, while opponents consider that its very vaguely-defined capacities and powers will only lead to abuses, and to the Romanian people losing faith in the Legion as its national and spiritual guiding force, claiming that arresting people on a whim is not what the Captain would desire.

However, now it seems that his own turn as face of the Romanian ultranationalist right may be ending in fire just as A.C Cuza’s did.\n\nFew could predict that the seemingly-ascendant Legion of the Archangel Michael would begin to share its forebear’s fate, but the signs have grown ever clearer over the past months. Its growing size began to work against it, as the Legion began to host different caucuses and factions within itself, arguing over precise points of Legionary doctrine and interpreting various points in their own manner. While its Captain could keep control for a time, he still had moments where it seemed he could lose control over his movement’s future. And now, he sees his control unravel in a crisis worse than he had ever seen before, as the infighting within the Legionary Movement is beginning to reach a fever pitch, with internal disputes wreaking havoc within the organisation’s stability and more and more members beginning to split apart from it.\n\nWhether this was caused by his own failings or by a specific stream of thought becoming too dominant is unclear, but one thing is certain; it would take a great effort to try and correct the course now. Codreanu’s own advisors have begun to hint that he should take a step back and embrace a more spiritual role in the Legion’s leadership and leave one of his trusted subordinates as political head, but some voices still consider that the Captain will be able to call upon divine providence this time as well and bring the chaos to an end. With the pressure and stress mounting upon Codreanu, already troubled by this turn of events, it remains to be seen what he will do to restore cohesion."

One bigger than most. Naturally, we have reasons to suspect it targets the King.\n\nAn emergency meeting of the Crown Council was called, and various solutions were proposed to this end. One idea is to cut down on Royal appearances outside the Palace and increase the Royal Guard detail when outside of its confines, altough this may be seen by some elements of the people as a sign of cowardice. Another one, related to the previous one would be to temporarily delegate the King’s duties to the Council of Ministers, with the ministers taking up some of the visits and protocolary journeys the King has to do, albeit the risk with this idea is that the angered Legionaries would try gunning down one of them instead. Finally, Royal confidant and Bucharest Police Prefect Gabriel Marinescu, known critic of the Legionaries, suggests to place their trust in the Police, increasing their presence should the King be about and vastly increasing their competencies. Critics of this plan point that the Police may not necessarily be prepared to handle this issue, and the Legionaries have prior experience with dealing with Police members anyway.

The assassins were driven off, but Calinescu, Andone and the driver were wounded, and will need time to recover.\n\nWhile the victims were injured, we are confident they will survive.

Few know what to expect of this new system, but the throngs of green-shirts certainly appear supportive of the project, seeing it as the capstone to their so-called "Great Legionary Victory"."

 romania.227.d:0 "Following the PNT's period of consolidation and governance, the time has come to finally revise the old Constitution of 1866, a deed which was carried out. After approval by the Legislating Chambers and the Sovereign, it is expected that the people will also approve it via referendum.\n\nInfluenced both by the old constitution and the views of theorists like Constantin Stere and Romul Boilă, the new constitution devotes vast space to defining and protecting individual rights, influenced by the British concept of habeas corpus. Centralisation, though still upheld, is tempered through local autonomy on the lowest levels, and the role of popular initiatives and referenda is increased. Not all provisions survived the discussion process however; the Superior Economic Council, the Unicameral Parliament and the idea of placing land use and repartition under State control did not make the revision.\n\nIts spirit however remained unscathed, and the frontment of the PNT are sure that their new constitution will be a major step forward towards a brighter future for Romania, as the nation moves forward as one."

 romania.228.d:0 "Under the PNL's wise stewardship, a new constitution was drafted and approved. Honouring the dreams of the late Ionel Brătianu and King Ferdinand, the new constitution enshrines the new democratic system, as well as codifying the new developments of the years since the last constitutional adoption. It will be submitted to a referendum, which it will most likely pass.\n\nMany provisos of the old have been kept but modernised: the King still mantains extensive prerogatives like vetoing laws, issuing pardons and vetos, appointing and dismissing ministers, but he can exercise it only with the agreement of his ministers. For he reigns, but does not govern.\n\nRights previously enshrined were still codified, the status of the Romanian Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches as dominant faiths was enshrined, and, above all, the national and indivisible character of the Nation was solidified, further cementing the Great Union of all Romanians under one nation."

It'll just be the PNL all over again."\n\nThe announcement of new elections has stirred up debate in Romania's public spaces; as people from the highest intellectuals to the peasants in the fields are pondering just what will the future hold and are deciding just what party will be the next one to lead Romania forward. Cynicism still remains strong among certain segments of the populace, who may hold nostalgia for Carol II or for the Captain and his men, but the flourishing of popular dialogue gives many of the more educated citizens hope that democracy may yet take root in Romania."

And in this particular village, the blacksmith's grove is the stage for this communal news discussion.\n\n"Let's see. Apparently Mihalache wants to easen up peasant financial burdens and promises a debt relief law if his guys make it to Parliament."\n\n"Really, Ilie?

It was in these heated discussions that opinions grew, exchanges were had but ultimately all was forgiven. For such was the nature of these newspaper chats; just as easily as they could lead to fiery debates, they could lead to the forgiveness of whatever bad blood ensued over a cup of wine or two later on."

In depressingly common event, group of Magyar terrorists attacked small military patrol deep in Alföld. Our men had hardly answered to the fire when the criminals fled. The patrol was left to tend to their dead and wounded as the hunt for the attackers started, but it was clear for everyone that it would be a fruitless effort. The various separatist organisations of the Alföld region had nearly full support of the locals, and were sheltered and supported by the Hungarian farmers. The only thing we could do is to increase security and keep the cities under increasingly tight grasp."

It is not known how the perpetrators were able to coordinate such an act of subterfuge, but it is likely they were assisted by sympathetic officials in the local government here. Although they were taken down with haste, the damage was already done. Several outlets had taken photos of the buildings, the news spreading like wildfire in Hungarian newspapers across the border. While nobody was hurt, this act is likely to only embolden the resistance cells here."

The attempts of the Military Police in the area to persue after him were thwarted by a rather uncooperative crowd and he was ultimately able to escape. Follow up investigations from witnesses also proved to be unfruitful as many Hungarians outright refused to provide a testimony to the Gendarmerie. It is likely we will never find the perpetrator, having most likely smuggled himself over the Hungarian border, beyond our grasp."

All together we lost 17 men once a body count was conducted after the fighters slipped back into the night. Thousands of rifles, hundreds of machine guns and two dozen crates of grenades are now unaccounted for, likely already having been proliferated between several underground cells in the province. If this equipment is allowed to remain out there, it will only lead to more issues in the future for us dealing with the rebels. What should we do?"

Not even his own flock is behind him, as many of his rivals are already smelling blood.\n\nThe King would be rejoicing if he was not stuck in the same accusations as his government is. After all, the war with Bulgaria was one of the few things he agreed on with Codreanu. The liberal opposition, reinvigorated by the total failure of both would-be-dictators, is calling for Carol II's second abdication - this time for ever. Having lost the will to resist these calls, Carol II officially abdicated few days later.\n\nIn the surprise new chance for Romanian democracy, Constantin Brătianu and his National Liberals have once more formed a government with cooperation with young king Mihai I. Together they swear to rebuild the battered Romanian democracy - and if God wills it, build a society without Codreanus and Carol II."

He has seen much over his relatively short life, and now he finally takes the throne after the fierce power struggle between his father the King and the then-Prime Minister, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.\n\nA far more reserved individual than his bombastic father, Mihai's profound Anglophilia and appreciation towards the British monarchy drove him to begin renewing the dramatically-weakened democratic process in his country, seeing it as the way to truly heal the grievous wounds opened in the wake of the defeat in the Great War and that the national unification has started to patch up. It may be a heavy burden for his young shoulders, but the King feels that with proper guidance, both he and his country will overcome all adversities and go forward as one."

He has seen much over his relatively short life, and now he finally takes the throne after the fierce power struggle between his father the King and the then-Prime Minister, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.\n\nIn spite of his bigger appreciation of democracy compared to his ambitious father, the Legionary dominance of his government forces him to lay low. Though he would like to eventually restore the rule of democracy in his home country and fulfil the dream of his grandfather Ferdinand, the Green Hydra's stranglehold over his country is too formidable at the present date to dislodge. While they haven't moved against him, the greenshirts have learned from their mistakes with King Carol, and now the Archangel's men keep a watchful eye over Mihai's own undertakings. Though he finds relief in his interests of cars and planes, the young King faces a certain fright that if he does anything wrong he'll face the wrath of the Greenshirts, forcing him to at least silently acquiesce to their projects for now. Yet the young King hopes that some day he'll have his chance to finally uproot the Legion from its roost, restore democracy and mend his nation's wounds."

His country's loss however, hit hard, and as he saw the malaise his future kingdom had fallen in, he swore to remake the country into that which it was supposed to be. An autocratic charmer par excellence, he used the small-but-rising Legionary Movement as a sledgehammer to further weaken the declining PNL and the Legionaries' old rivals, the National-Christian Defence League. Now however, the scheming King faces one last hurdle in his path towards redeeming his country; the very same Legionary Movement he once supported, and its shadowy Captain, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. As clouds gather on the horizon of the post-Weltkrieg order, both King and Captain foresee opportunities to achieve their goal of national unification and breaking the other's power, and the King, though a flawed man, will act upon any opportunities that come his way to establish himself as his country's uncontested Sun."

 POLITICS_CANTACUZINO_DESC:0 "A scion of the ancient princely Cantacuzino family claiming descent from the Byzantine Kantakouzenos dynasty, Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino is a very atypical nobleman. A firm believer in the precepts of the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Cantacuzino made himself remarked in numerous nationalist student congresses, holding fiery speeches denouncing what he saw as blights over his country. Rapidly rising through the Legionary Movement's ranks, becoming a member of the Captain's inner circle and making himself known as a theorist and as an efficient organiser, Cantacuzino became a minister in the Captain's cabinet after their rise to power. Cutting his teeth even more in the Spanish Civil War, the Prince returned home only to become embroiled in the escalating conflict between the Captain and the King.\n\nShocked by the assassination of Codreanu, Cantacuzino joined the fight, rallying many Legionaries to the cause and helping reorganise the movement for the struggle, emerging as a front-runner for the succession of the Captain. Soon enough, the zeal of the Archangel's men won out, and now the barred cross flies true above all of Romania once more. Having asserted himself as worthy of the position, the Legionary Senate has confirmed him as the Captain's successor, and now he stands ready to implement his vision over all of Romania, as its Conducator and Regent."

In spite of his mother’s protests, he fell for a woman, Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti, daughter-in-law to liberal politician Nicolae N. Saveanu, who divorced her then-husband to be by her new beau’s side. Unlike his brother however, Nicolae married his lover outright, violating the Statute of the Royal House and creating a rift between him and his brother; a rift that would lead him to make overtures towards the Legionary Movement.\n\nAfter his brother’s abdication, Nicolae agreed to a deal between him and the ascendant Legionaries where he would take the throne if the Statute of the Royal House was modified accordingly to legitimise his marriage to Ioana. Now, as King, he continues to not show much interest in political affairs, preferring to focus on his own undertakings and hobbies instead."
