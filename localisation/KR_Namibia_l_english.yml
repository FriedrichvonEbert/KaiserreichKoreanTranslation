 nmb.14.a:0 "Send the army, quickly!"
 nmb.15.t:0 "Südwestafrika Wins the War!"
 nmb.15.d:0 "Südwestafrika has been embroiled in a civil war ever since Mittelafrika has collapsed, but they have beaten back the foolish natives.

 nmb.16.d:0 "With the crisis finally being officially over, it is time we decide who the official Statthalter will be. There were various suggestion and three Weltkrieg veterans who fought in Sudwestafrika have been put up for the task. The first option is keeping Heinrich Kircheim, the current Statthalter who advocates for overwhelming the inferior African opponents with superior German firepower, the second is Hans Hollander, who advocates for mobilising the African population to see a quick and sudden reunification of Mittelafrika, and the third option, Theodor von Hippel who thinks careful planning and thinking three steps ahead is the key to our expansion."
 nmb.16.a:0 "Heinrich Kircheim, who led us through the recent war."

 nmb.17.d:0 "Despite our victory in the Ovambo's revolt, there is still staunch resistance among a new group known as the 'Ovambo Movement', who raid towns in the hopes of letting the Ovambo people be free. This is all due to their leader, Uushona Shiimi managing to escape our clutches in the civil war. With towns being raided the conflicts do not show any signs of stopping, and the people demand we do something about the problem."
 nmb.17.a:0 "Search for Uushona Shiimi."

 nmb.20.t:0 "Local Village Destroyed"
 nmb.20.d:0 "Although we have placed military police at key locations within our country, it seems some areas got inevitably overlooked and The Ovambo Movement took notice. They have managed to raid a village of all it has, slaughtering the entire population and seizing many supplies. The peaceful section of the Ovambo people are also blaming us for painting their culture in a bad light by letting these actions continue."
 nmb.20.a:0 "Spread out the police force."
 nmb.21.t:0 "Uushona Shiimi Killed in Battle"
 nmb.21.d:0 "Following the recent wave of momentum in The Ovambo Movement, Uushona Shiimi himself decided to lead an expedition on a seemingly unguarded village. Little did he know that military forces were lying in wait for him, and attacked him on sight. The brave regiment managed to kill Uushona Shiimi, but the unit was wiped out by the grunts left over from the expedition. Although we have managed to end the momentum of the movement, this is a general distaste inside our population for letting this problem continue for so long."

 nmb.22.t:0 "Rumours of Namibian Oil"
 nmb.22.d:0 "Rumours have been circulating as of late of possible oil hidden within Namibia's crust, the question is whether these are truly rumours or truth. If these rumours are indeed true, this will result in Namibia going from a depopulated wasteland to a place of much wealth and trade, transforming the entire economy. However, to even search for the black gold will require many resources Germany is not willing to give. All that remains is deciding how much we are willing to invest in this."
 nmb.22.a:0 "Do a quick search."
 nmb.22.b:0 "Divert some of our funds towards the project."

 nmb.23.a:0 "Namibia is a gold-mine."
 nmb.24.t:0 "The Search goes Nowhere"
 nmb.24.d:0 "Despite vigorous searching, the oil is nowhere to be found. The entire project has proven to be a waste of resources and generally worthless. The hopes of Namibia ever being a profitable colony have been stomped to the ground and morale is at an all time low."
 nmb.24.a:0 "What a waste of time."
 nmb.25.t:0 "The Reformation of Mittelafrika"

 nmb.26.t:0 "Südwestafrika Requests Supplies"
 nmb.26.d:0 "Südwestafrika has found itself embroiled in a conflict with one of the treacherous African warlords, and is requesting our assistance. It would be wise to assist, as every gun we drop down there helps us get closer to the reformation of Mittelafrika, and our presence in Africa."
 nmb.26.a:0 "Send the supplies."
 nmb.26.b:0 "We can't spare anything at the moment."
 nmb.27.t:0 "Germany Sends Help"

 nmb.28.t:0 "We Fend for Ourselves"
 nmb.28.d:0 "Germany has decided against helping in this current conflict, claiming to not have more important things to do on the mainland. We will have to fight this one on our own, but we will be fine against this barbari scum."

 nmb.29.t:0 "Barotseland Resists our Invasion"
 nmb.29.d:0 "The Barotseland campaign has caused the area to devolved into anarchy. Even as our armies still fight on the battlefield, the Barotseland people have begun to fight the troops trying to keep the peace and are disrupting further planning for expansion into Africa. The threat will need to be dealt with soon, before support can reach into other areas we control as well."

 nmb.30.d:0 "With the revolution finally being brought to Namibia, we must hold a convention like all formal Syndicalist countries. Three main parties have ended up being contenders. There is the Radical Socialist RAP, which is run by young revolutionaries who wanted to be free from Mittelafrika, the SSP which wanted to bring a revolution to the entirety of Mittelafrika, and the Internationale aligned SPI which believe a European Revolution is necessary before an African one.

 nmb.31.ds:0 "German Namibians are a minority among normal Namibians, which migrated here when the German came into control in the 1880s. Unexpectedly, German Namibians have merged well with the Namibian culture and have even formed their own subculture among normal Namibians. However, some radical factions within the Congress think all German Namibians should be removed from Namibia, as they serve as a reminder of our time under imperialist German rule."
 nmb.31.da:0 "German Namibians are a minority among normal Namibians, which migrated here when the German came into control in the 1880s. Unexpectedly, German Namibians have merged well with the Namibian culture and have even formed their own subculture among normal Namibians.

 nmb.32.d:0 "With the official announcement of the deportation of German Namibians, we have already been met with fierce resistance. The Germans have protested in the streets that have not been gathered up yet with signs stating 'Auch wir sind Namibier!' meaning 'We are Namibians too!'. Some consider continuing or implementing harsher policies on the population to make them stop, while others suggest giving up on the project altogether."
 nmb.32.a:0 "Continue as normal"
 nmb.32.b:0 "Put those who resist at the end of our gun"
 nmb.32.c:0 "Maybe we should let them stay..."
 nmb.33.t:0 "The Germans Revolt!"
 nmb.33.s:0 "With our decision to react hostile to the German protests, the resistance has only grown larger, with even our own population going against us in some areas. While our guards are doing well in suppressing the areas, it has made the people lose confidence in our government."
 nmb.33.ns:0 "Our decision to let the protests continue has resulted in the German population in the south revolting against our government, but has failed to gain popular traction within the rest of Namibia. however, as long as this revolt continues, we can expect to have delays in the deportation process."

 nmb.33.b:0 "They're leaving, by force if necessary"
 nmb.34.t:0 "The German Revolt Ends"
 nmb.34.d:0 "Due to our efforts, the German revolt has officially come to an end. The fact that it happened in the first place is less than desirable, with many lives being unnecessarily lost on both sides in the process. The Germans have begun to pack up their bags and are being exported. Hopefully Namibia won't have a problem like this anytime into the future."
 nmb.34.a:0 "Surely this could've been handled better"
 nmb.34.b:0 "They've learned their lesson"
 nmb.35.t:0 "The Germans Leave Africa"
 nmb.35.d:0 "With the revolt over and the situation calmed, the German 'Namibians' have finally left our home. The exportation was a sad time for many Namibians who got close to the Germans, and is still left a highly unpopular decision among our government.
