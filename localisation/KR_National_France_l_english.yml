# Seize Morocco #

NFA_seize_morocco_decisions:0 "모로코 지역 점령"
NFA_seize_morocco_decisions_desc:0 "19세기 이래로 우리는 모로코를 되찾으려는 야망을 키워왔습니다. 이제 모로코를 꽉잡고 있던 다른 세력들이 혼란에 빠졌으니, 이제 모로코를 다시 우리땅으로 만들 때입니다! 프랑스 만세!"
NFA_seize_real_morocco:0 "모로코 왕국을 되찾자!"
NFA_seize_real_morocco_desc:0 "독일이 유럽에서 패배했으니, 이제 우리가 가지고 있던 땅을 다시 되찾을 시간입니다!"
NFA_seize_spanish_morocco:0 "스페인령 리오델오로를 점령하라!"
NFA_seize_spanish_morocco_desc:0 "전국노동연맹이 스페인을 점령했고, 그에따라 스페인의 옛 식민지였던 리오델오로도 전국노동연맹의 소유가 되었습니다. 이 지역을 확보하길 원한다면, 아나키스트들이 불안정한 지금이 공격하기에 적합한 시기입니다."

# Help a side of Spain #

NFA_help_spain_decisions:0 "스페인 내전"
NFA_help_spain_decisions_desc:0 "스페인은 수십년간 여러 불안정한 요소에 의해 흔들려왔고, 결국 일이 났습니다. 한쪽은 무신론적인 아나키스트 단체, 전국노동연맹입니다. 다른 한쪽은 카를로스파를 가장한 포르투갈 통일주의 동맹들의 지지를 받는 이들인데, 이들이 주도권을 갖게 된다면 우리의 동맹이 될 수 있을겁니다. 마지막으로는 알폰소 13세의 정통정부는 국민들로부터 미움을 샀지만 독일과는 좋은 관계를 갖고 있습니다. 어느쪽을 지원해야할까요?"
NFA_help_kos:0 "정통정부 지원"
NFA_help_kos_desc:0 "스페인의 진정한 평화와 민주주의의 수호를 위하여, 부르봉 정부가 정권을 유지해야 합니다."
NFA_help_car:0 "카를로스파 지원"
NFA_help_car_desc:0 카를로스파는 스페인을 다시 올바르게 만들 유일한 방법입니다. 포르투갈은 이 곳이 우리가 지원할 정확한 분파라고 확신하게 했습니다. 물론, 만약 우리가 그들을 지원해서 그들이 성공한다면 우리의 동맹이 될 것입니다."

Invest_Construction:0 "민간 산업에 투자"
Invest_Construction_desc:0 "우리의 산업은 원수의 정부가 준 도움 덕분에 망명의 여파 속에서도 다시 관리되고 있습니다. 이것은 그들의 번영 대부분의 근원이 정부와의 계약 덕이란 것을 누구보다도 잘 알고 있는 산업계의, 페탱에 대한 거대한 호의를 만들어냈습니다. 좀 더 전략적인 투자는 확실히 이러한 호의를 발전시킬 것입니다.\n\n이런 기업들에 너무 많은 재원을 투자하는 것은 우리 국가에선 특정한 요소로 인해, §R부패§! 로 보일 수 있습니다.  그들은 이러한 정부에 친절하지 않을지도 모릅니다."
Invest_Arms_Factory:0 "군수 산업에 투자"
Invest_Arms_Factory_desc:0 "중요한 정부의 투자 덕분에, 망명했을 때부터 모든 프랑스인들의 마음 속에 있는, 본토 재수복을 위한 준비로 군수 산업이 번창했습니다. 하지만, 군비 수요가 증가해감에 따라, 특히 코뮌과의 전쟁이 코앞에 있는 것을 고려해서, 우리가 내부와 외부의 적을 상대하는 것을 도와줄, 충성스럽다고 알려진 기업에의 투자는 일석이조일 것입니다.\n\n이런 기업들에 너무 많은 재원을 투자하는 것은 우리 국가에선 특정한 요소로 인해, §R부패§! 로 보일 수 있습니다.  그들은 이러한 정부에 친절하지 않을지도 모릅니다."
Support_Loyal_Business:0 "충성스러운 기업에 보상"
Support_Loyal_Business_desc:0 "우리의 영향력을 굳히기 위해, 이런 힘든 시기에 원수의 편에서 충실한 기업에 충성심에 보답하는 것은 현명한 생각일 것입니다. 여기 정부와의 계약 몇 개가 있습니다. 건설 허가를 빠르게 내주거나, 쓸데없는 약간의 사법적 문제를 조용히 다른 기업들에게 일으키거나 하는 것은 산업계 대부분의 지지를 보장해줄 것이고, 여전히 우리를 돕는 것에 벽을 치고 있는 사람들이 납득하게 할 것입니다.\n\n이런 기업들에 너무 많은 재원을 투자하는 것은 우리 국가에선 특정한 요소로 인해, §R부패§! 로 보일 수 있습니다. 그들은 이러한 정부에 친절하지 않을지도 모릅니다."
Back_Newspaper:0 "충성스러운 언론을 지원"
Back_Newspaper_desc:0 "언론은 권력 투쟁에서 중요하고, 우리에게 충성스러운 사람들의 지지는 눈에 띄지 않을 것입니다. 우리의 주장을 뒷받침해주는 신문를 조용히 지원할 것입니다. 사전에 알려지지 않은 정보에 접근할 수 있게 해주거나, 국민들이 모르닥의 어리석음을 납득하도록 계속해서 도울 것이라고 우리가 확신할 수 있는 언론에게는 검열을 약하게 할 것을 약속하거나.\n\n이런 기업들에 너무 많은 재원을 투자하는 것은 우리 국가에선 특정한 요소로 인해, §R부패§! 로 보일 수 있습니다.  그들은 이러한 정부에 친절하지 않을지도 모릅니다."

Mordacq_takes_to_the_waves:0 "§R모르닥과 라디오!§!"
Mordacq_takes_to_the_waves_desc:0 "곰은 우리 국가에 음성 방송을 전달하려고 계획하고 있습니다. 그의 선동적인 언행을 가정에 있는 우리의 많은 동포에게 직접적으로 전하는 것은 끔찍할수도 있습니다. 그의 방송을 막는 것은 그의 수사법을 확실하게 만들 뿐입니다. 대신에, 우리는 이 발언들이 너무 큰 영향을 미치지 않도록 방법을 찾아야만 합니다."
Mordacq_parade:0 "§R행진하는 곰§!"
Mordacq_parade_desc:0 "앙리 모르닥과 그의 민주주의 지지자들은 주요 도시에서 시위를 계획하고 있습니다. 정체되고 부패하다고 간주한 정권에 대해, 그들의 불만을 말할 수 있길 바라면서요. 만약 그들이 너무 많은 사람들을 모집한다면, 우리 정부에게 타격을 입힐 수 있을 것이고, 국민들은 곰에 대한 지지가 널리 퍼져있다는 착각에 빠져 더 많은 것이 그의 손아귀로 빠져버릴 것입니다. 어떻게든 해야만 합니다."
Mordacqs_Speech:0 "§R모르닥의 거대 연설§!"
Mordacqs_Speech_desc:0 "모르닥에게 곧 그의 지지자들보다 더 많을 수 있는 거대한 군중 앞에서 연설할 기회가 주어질 것입니다. 이에 적절하게 대응하기 위한 방법으로, 정부는 두 가지를 제시했습니다. 일부는 그 연설이 그대로 진행되어야 한다고 주장하고, 다른 사람들은, 원수가 같은 날, 가까운 곳에서 연설할 수 있다고 주장합니다. 어느 쪽이든 선택해야만 합니다."
Mordacq_In_The_Barracks:0 "§R위대한 침묵에서의 속삭임§!"
Mordacq_In_The_Barracks_desc:0 "정치적 혼란은, 공화국 정치에의 참여를 자제해왔기 때문에 대개 "라 그랑드 뮈에트", 위대한 침묵이라고 불리는 군대를, 천천히 정권의 핵심으로 만들 기회를 주었습니다. 만약 민주주의라는 헛소리가 뿌리내리면 안 되는 곳이 있다면, 바로 그곳입니다. 고맙게도 가창 초라한 보병조차도 여전히 베르됭의 영웅에 대한 존경으로 가득 차 있습니다. 하지만 반체제 문학이 최근 막사와 장교 휴게실에서 발견되었습니다. 어떻게든 해야만 합니다."

NFA_Call_For_Moral_Order:0 "도덕적 질서의 부름"
NFA_Call_For_Moral_Order_desc:0 "부패에 대한 터무니 없는 주장이 유포되고 있고, 원수는 입장을 취해야만 합니다. 그는 방송을 통해 시민들에게 이 어려운 시기에 도덕적으로 행동하라고 전할 것이고, 정부에 대한 어떠한 비판도 생디칼리스트 간첩에 의해 퍼진 단순한 프로파간다라고 맹렬히 비난할 것입니다."
NFA_Make_Corruption_Crime:0 "부패와 싸우다"
NFA_Make_Corruption_Crime_desc:0 "최근 수면 위로 떠오른 부패 스캔들에서 원수가 무결하다는 것을 시민들에게 증명하기 위해, 우리는 모든 사회 수준에서 광범위한 반-부패 운동을 시작할 것이고, 그들이 목격했거나 피해자가 된 공무원의 어떠한 부패든지 고발하도록 격려할 것입니다. 그것은 엄청난 노력을 필요로 할 것이지만, 그럴 가치가 있을 겁니다."
NFA_Scapegoats:0 "부패와 싸우기 위한 창의적 방법"
NFA_Scapegoats_desc:0 "부패와 싸우는 우리의 가장 진지한 노력조차 국민들을 만족시킬 충분한 결과를 내지 못했습니다. 그런 만큼 우리는 부패 혐의의 증거를 찾아내는 데에 더 느슨해져야 할지도 모르고, 의심스러운 사람들에게 자백을 더 적극적으로 받아내야 할지도 모릅니다. 그들은 아마 뭔가 잘못했을 것입니다. 아니면 코뮌의 요원이거나, 아니면 또 다른 무언가일겁니다. 솔직히 누가 상관하겠습니까?"

# AF trials Decisions #

NFA_decision_AF_trials_cat:0 "공화정 잔당 다루기"
NFA_decision_AF_trials_cat_desc:0 "드디어, 우리는 공화정을 끌어내렸습니다. 그리고, 우리의 위대한 국가에서 그러한 유해한 영향을 없애기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. 하지만, 공화정을 여전히 지킬 필요가 있다고 믿는 자들이 있습니다. 공화정의 영향이 남아있는 한, 우리는 진정으로 프랑스를 개혁하지 못할 수 있습니다. 이와 같이, 프랑스의 신체 일부를 제거하는 것은 불가피할 것입니다.\n\n이러한 결정은 §Y공화정 잔당§! 국민 정신을 제거하고, 당신의 선택에 따라 다른 국민 정신을 줄 것입니다."
NFA_Public_Humiliation:0 "공화주의자들에게 공개적으로 망신주기"
NFA_Public_Humiliation_desc:0 "사소한 범죄자들, 예를 들어 공화국을 옹호했거나, 시위를 지지했거나, 드 골의 정부에 대해 부당한 비판을 한 언론인 같은 경우에는 좀 더 교육적인 방법으로 충분할 것입니다. 그들은 그들이 썼던 글과 공화정을 공개적으로 부인할 수 밖에 없을 것이고 ,새로운 정부에 충성을 맹세한 다음 안전하게 보내질 것입니다."
NFA_Arrest_Republican_Leaders:0 "정치인들 체포"
NFA_Arrest_Republican_Leaders_desc:0 "많은 정치인들은 암묵적으로 시위를 지지했고, 평범한 공화주의에게 우리를 더욱 깊숙히 빠트리기 위해, 단지 원수의 정부에 대항할 적당한 때를 기다렸을 뿐입니다. 모르닥의 많은 지지자들은 이미 체포되었고, 다른 의원들은 드 골의 정부에 점점 더 화나고 있는 것 같습니다. 철저한 수사는 여전히 공화국이 버텨내기를 바랄지도 모르는 사람들을 분별하도록 도울 것입니다."
NFA_Cleanse_the_Police:0 "경찰 계급 정리"
NFA_Cleanse_the_Police_desc:0 "질서 유지 임무를 맡은 몇몇 경찰관은, 마지막 시위의 운명적인 날, 유혈 사태가 일어나자 시위대에 합류했습니다. 우리가 생각했던 공공 기능의 깊은 부패를 나타내는 것일 수도 있고, 우리 경찰에 대한 수사로 불미스러운 비밀이 드러날 지도 모릅니다."
NFA_Purge_the_Military:0 "군대 숙청"
NFA_Purge_the_Military_desc:0 ""위대한 침묵"이라고 생각되는 군대는 최근 몇 달 동안 너무나도 시끄러웠습니다. 우리 중 몇몇이 초기 시위에 참가했음에도 불구하고, 슬프게도 일부는 모르닥의 열렬한 지지자임이 분명합니다. 그들은 우리 왕의 군대에서, 장교로 믿을 수 없을지도 모릅니다. 군대는 전통적으로 공화정 아래에서 반동적 요새였고, 계속 그렇게 있어야 합니다. 철저한 조사가 이루어질 것이고, 의심스러운 사람은 누구든지, 소총수든, 장군이든 모두 조사받아야 할 것입니다."
NFA_Those_Who_Slither:0 "어둠 속에서 나아가는 자들"
NFA_Those_Who_Slither_desc:0 "우리가 잠재적 반역자들을 찾아보지 않은 단 한 곳은, 바로 우리의 정보부, 제 2부서입니다. 모르닥의 탈출과 민주 진영은, 항상 우리의 다음 행동을 알고 있는 것 같습니다, 우리는 그 곳에 첩자가 있는 걸 알지만, 지금까지 누구인지 알아내지 못했습니다. 우리는 문제의 원인을 잡기 위해, 극비리에 행동해야 합니다."

Of course it is impossible to erase the past and some things will never be undone, and as such we will keep the good, tear down the bad, bring justice to those who deserve it, and ensure that never again our people are tempted by syndicalism.

Though it couldn’t be called a party, after all the group openly advocates for a coup d’état and has never participated in elections, the AF has created a surprisingly broad network of influence among Catholics radicalised by the anticlerical violence of the revolution, in intellectual circles, and, most importantly, within the military.§!"

Close to PSF, with whom he shares a conception of democratic rule with a strong head, he has surprisingly been elected president by a parliament newly dominated by the Bloc National, creating worry among committed Republicans.

Though he had assured them of his commitment to the Republic, the support for the restoration of House Bonaparte on the throne of France quickly grew.\n\nAfter his victory against the German Empire and the reconquest of all rightfully French land, his popularity further skyrocketed, and restoration was a simple formality: a single plebiscite and the Empire was reborn.

An alumnus of Saint-Cyr, he was grievously wounded during the Great War, was mentioned in dispatches nine times and became at thirty-three one of the youngest commanding officers in the French armed forces, receiving the Légion d'Honneur for military valour in 1916. A patriot and pious Catholic, he remained loyal to the government as the revolution broke out. After the exile he joined the Croix-de-Feu, a veterans group that quickly attracted tens of thousands of veterans who hoped to revive the spirit of comradeship of the trenches and quickly rose through the ranks, becoming its president in 1931. A supporter of Henri Mordacq, like him he supports democracy and the Republic, though he prefers a strong rule, scarred by the infamous parliamentary instability of the Third Republic. Having founded the Parti Social Français in the early 1930s, the party quickly grew exponentially, becoming the first mass party in French politics, all devoted to the Colonel and his hope of a reformed Republic.\n\nChosen to head the democratic coalition after the end of Marshal Pétain’s junta, he has served France since implementing much of his ideas. Now that democracy has been fully restored, he has predictably been elected president by an assembly dominated by the Bloc National and hopes to further transform the Republic, away from the instability of the past, into a strong regime equipped to face any future threat."

As such, he has formed a new government with military figures, to temporarily head France until full democracy can be safely restored."
POLITICS_LOUIS_MARIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1871, Louis Marin is a veteran of parliamentary politics, having first been elected as a deputy of his native Moselle in 1905, being a founding member of the Fédération Republicaine that he headed until its fusion with the Alliance Démocratique, he has been a part of the Chamber of Deputies for now close to four decades. An ethnography professor, conservative, cultured, patriotic, a moderate Catholic, Marin is the very picture of a distinguished older gentleman, well appreciated by his colleagues and the public at large. An ardent defender of the primacy of parliament, he nonetheless did little to oppose Marshal Pétain’s bid to power, though he still often privately agitated for a restoration of democracy.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those chosen to be a part of the Government of National Unity, a new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the right in the latest legislative elections, he has been elected president, almost as if it was the natural conclusion of his illustrious career. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, he nonetheless hopes to revive the spirit of the early Third Republic and head a conservative, moderate, patriotic regime."
POLITICS_EDOUARD_DALADIER_DESC:0 "Born in 1884, son of a baker, a teacher then mayor of his hometown of Carpentras, Édouard Daladier is a pure product of Republican meritocracy. After years on the Western Front, where he bravely served and received citations and the Légion d’Honneur, he remained loyal to the government after the revolution broke out. In exile, a  man of the moderate left, he was seen with suspicion despite his opposition to revolutionary socialism, especially as he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical, so recently divided as its left-wing joined the socialists in revolt. He fiercely defended the primacy of parliament against Marshal Pétain’s creeping encroachment, which earned him the praise of the few remaining committed democrats and the nickname “the Bull of Vaucluse” for his pugnacity.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain’s regime, he was of course among those called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, the new Union Sacrée. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PAUL_REYNAUD_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, a lawyer by trade, Paul Reynaud was young enough to be mobilised in 1914 and fight in every major engagement of the Great War, even being dispatched to Russia to assist the White forces in 1918. After the defeat, a man of the moderate right, thoroughly committed to economic liberalism, he joined the ranks of the Alliance Démocratique, revealing himself to be a captivating orator and fierce political animal in the chaos of exile. When Marshal Pétain and his supporters formed an emergency government, he begrudgingly accepted the new status quo, but never wavered in his commitment to his ideals of liberal, democratic Republic. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives.\n\nWith democracy restored, Reynaud is hard at work to restore the spirit of the Republic, deeply damaged by the defeat and the junta. Preferring a more active role as president, he hopes to implement his unorthodox economic ideas, shying away from free-market economics in favour of light dirigisme, making him a somewhat more amenable to the PSF."
POLITICS_CAMILLE_CHAUTEMPS_DESC:0 "Born in 1885, Camille Chautemps could be described as the prototypical Radical. Born into a bourgeois family of Radical politicians, a lawyer by trade, a prominent Freemason, committed to economic and political liberalism as well parliamentary supremacy, he quickly rose through the ranks of the Parti Radical following the exile, appreciated for his fierce denunciations of the breakaway left-wing of the party, and willingness to compromise with his opponents. He was among those who actively defended a return to normal democratic life following the bid of Marshal Pétain for power but quickly found himself somewhat isolated. Indeed, his Freemason links worked against him, as he was given the nickname of “Sublime Prince of the Royal Secret” by right-wing newspapers, accused of working in concert with the left-wing of the Radical party still active in the Commune.\n\nFollowing the fall of Marshal Pétain, though he was not called to serve as part of the Government of National Unity, he remained active in the party. With the victory of the reunited Radical Party during the latest legislative elections, he was chosen by his peers as president. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed Republic, parliamentary, secular, and liberal."
POLITICS_PIERRE_FLANDIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1889, Pierre-Étienne Flandin is a lawyer by trade, but as the son of a politician, he was naturally predisposed to following in his footsteps. Elected to parliament at only 25, his burgeoning career was cut short by the Great War during which he served with distinction as a balloon observer. There was born his speciality: advocacy for aeronautical development, and precise technical knowledge. Indeed, Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British. A man of the moderate right, he joined the Alliance Démocratique. When the AD fused with the Fédération Républicaine to create the Parti Républicain Démocrate, he quickly further rose to prominence in this consolidated liberal right-wing, one of the few voices in parliament to even attempt to push back on some of the Marshal’s initiatives. His skills as a knowledgeable technician have made him indispensable in parliamentary commissions, his advice sought after by the government and across political lines.\n\nIn short, he is an unassuming but unifying figure within Parliament, and as such he was asked to be part of the Government of National Unity after the fall of Marshal Pétain. With the coalition surviving, to the surprise of many, he was the natural compromise between the right and the left. Preferring a largely ceremonial role, in the tradition of the Third Republic, he hopes to lead a renewed regime, parliamentary and liberal."
POLITICS_PHILIPPE_PETAIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1856, by 1914 Philippe Pétain was on his way towards retirement after a discreet and honourable career as innovative military theorist and professor at the École de Guerre. The Great War destroyed any hope of a quiet retirement, however: from the early days of the war, he distinguished himself as a capable and charismatic leader of men, appreciated by his troops to whom he showed paternal care and quickly shot up the ranks, replacing officers who had failed in Belgium and northern France. Then came Verdun, where he issued his iconic order: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, granting him national fame. His care for proper logistics and morale contributed heavily to the victory, and from then on he was “the Lion of Verdun”. Emboldened by his successes and having earned the respect of the many men that served under him, he was able to restore order during the mutinous mood of 1916, and when the front broke between British and French armies at Amiens in 1918, he was the one who succeeded Supreme Commander Foch and stabilised the front. It was his ideas that permitted the successful counter-attacks, his presence that prevented wider mutiny from occurring. This sadly was not enough to prevent defeat.\n\nGiven the honourary rank of Marshal before going into semi-retirement, he remained silent as even in exile the Republic descended into parliamentary chaos. Finally, in 1926, supported by veterans and heroes of the Great War, he had enough and stepped in, strong-arming the Parliament into being elected president and declaring a state of emergency. Seen as an apolitical, unifying figure, this move was welcomed by many. Since then, the Marshal has worked tirelessly to reform France and prepare her for the inevitable conflict ahead. However, his increasing lack of reverence for even the pretence of democracy has alienated many, and the future of the regime is uncertain.\n\nNevertheless, the Lion of Verdun roars from Algiers, and he is determined to free France with only a single personal purpose in mind: that he be one day buried at Verdun along with so many heroes."

However, his increasing lack of reverence for even the pretence of democracy had alienated many. After conflict broke out with Reformists and partisans of a restored democracy, however, the regime is now revitalised, in particular thanks to the influence of the Redressement Français whose advice is proving crucial in the construction of the French State.\n\nNow more than ever, the Lion of Verdun roars from Algiers, and he is determined to free France with only a single personal purpose in mind: that he be one day buried at Verdun along with so many heroes."
POLITICS_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_DESC:0 "Born in 1890 in a well-off, profoundly catholic, royalist family, Charles de Gaulle was raised with a taste for hard work, discipline, and profound love for France. At the age of 15, he wrote a story starring a “General de Gaulle” leading French troops to victory against Germany, avenging the loss of 1870: he has spent his whole life working towards making the dreams of his youth of leading France to victory a reality. An average but hard-working student, he was well-liked by his peers, earning the nickname “the Rooster” for his capacity to assert his authority. He graduated from the Saint-Cyr military academy before joining the ranks of the army as an officer, under the orders of then Colonel Pétain. There he would become his lifelong protégé, serving under Pétain at Verdun, where he was wounded and captured by the Germans. Escaping captivity later on in the war, he quickly became a national symbol of resistance against the aggression of the Boches.\n\nWith the defeat and exile, he became a renowned military theorist and lecturer, remaining close to Pétain and becoming the leader of the “Young Guard”, a clique of younger officers deeply loyal to the Marshal and favouring the military reform ideas of de Gaulle. At the same time, witnessing the parliamentary chaos of the early exile, he became further convinced by the arguments of the Action Française, coming to believe that for France to be reborn, the Republic had to be sacrificed. As such, he entirely supported the initiative of Marshal Pétain to seize power, hoping that in time his mentor too would see the truth in the AF’s arguments, and would abolish the Gueuse. A decade later, this hasn’t happened, but de Gaulle remains hopeful that as he grows in influence, he will be able to restore the monarchy before freeing the nation from the Anti-France."
POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "Born in 1874, Jean d’Orléans was for long a picture of aristocratic aloofness. He was after all far down the line of succession of the House of France. Barred from service in the French army, he joined the Danish army for some time, as the king Valdemar was his brother-in-law, before eventually settling in Morocco hoping to promote French interests in the region. The Great War would, however, transform him: once again barred from joining the armies of the Republic, he joined the Medical Service of the Red Cross, transforming his French chateau into a hospital and personally taking care of the wounded. Though with initially little interest in politics, the defeat and break out of the revolution would further convince him of the need for deep reform, bringing him closer to the Action Française. In 1924, following the death of his cousin Philippe d’Orléans without an heir, he was acclaimed by royalists as the rightful pretender to the throne of France. In exile in now German Morocco, he would continue the cooperation with the Integralists started by his predecessors. Royalist efforts were now entirely concentrated around the AF, particularly as the Catholic hierarchy went past their issues with the movement, deeply shocked by the anticlerical violence of the syndicalist revolution. In 1933, he issued a manifesto calling for a “royal government” to save France, instead of a “government of parties”, a clear shot at Pétain’s regime: this would further enhance his political profile in a France-in-exile where the prestige of the Republic was at its lowest and the Marshal’s junta was rapidly losing support.\n\nWith the triumph of Charles de Gaulle against democratic and reformist forces, few were surprised that the new head of state called for a restoration of the monarchy. King Jean III now leads France as it struggles to purge the remnants of the Republic from the nation, and prepares her, the Eldest Daughter of the Church, to the holiest of struggles, a crusade to reconquer the métropole from the Reds."
POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "Born in 1908, young Henri d’Orléans has known exile his whole life. He lived a carefree early childhood on his father’s property in Morocco, where he was found to be a particularly bright child, curious and caring of the various workers of the vast plantation, quickly becoming fluent in French, Arabic, English, German, Italian and Spanish. Soon, however, he would be with his father in his chateau-hospital, being exposed to the horrors of war, before having to flee from the wrath of the revolutionaries. This incident would prove deeply traumatic for Henri, sowing the seeds of a later political awakening. Back in Morocco, he was tutored by the best European tutors, who would introduce him to Integralist thought, which resonated deeply with the youth: not just in its deeply reactionary rhetoric, but most particularly in its advocacy of strict adherence to the Social Doctrine of the Church and economic reform along with corporatist thought. Furthering his studies in Belgium, he discovered for the first time the crowded housing, poor working conditions and terrible anonymity of the lives of the European working poor, as he was attending to their needs as part of Catholic charity efforts. When his father became the head of the House of France in 1924, he became its Dauphin, immediately surrounded by advisors who sought to shape the young man into a worthy King of France. As heir presumptive, now banned from France, the dashing Dauphin nevertheless fully dedicated himself to the royalist cause, working closely with the Action Française despite his personal enmity towards Charles Maurras, as he could recognise that the growing movement was the best chance for restoration of the monarchy. His marriage to his cousin Isabelle de Orléans e Bragança in 1931, and the birth of their son Henri in 1933 created further enthusiasm among royalists: the future of the House of France secured.\n\nOften making discreet trips across the border from Morocco to meet with royalist leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, Henri was instrumental in the struggle that led to the restoration of the monarchy. In the early years of the renewed kingdom, he assisted his ageing father in every way and was often seen as the real power behind the throne, attempting to outmanoeuvre the Action Française about as often as he worked with them. Now in power, King Henri hopes to continue the rebirth of France, to build a monarchy that will last for another thousand years."

NFA_anti_communard_desc:0 "After our defeat in the Weltkrieg of 1919, the communards rose up again and abolished our cherished Republic. Luckily, some of the most important figures of the Republic have immigrated to Algeria where they plan to organise the counter-revolution. Now that the syndicalist traitors have taken full control of the mainland, we must crush them! We must ensure that our Eternal France will always be free!"

NFA_native_unrest_2:0 "Code de l'Indigénat"
NFA_native_unrest_2_desc:0 "The Code of the Indiginate remains in place since its creation in 1887. A diverse set of laws and regulations imposed on the native populations of the empire, they enshrine their inferior legal status despite them being technically French citizens. Collective punishment, a paralel justice system, forced labour and service in the armed forces, enforced by native elites under the guise of modernisation and spread of civilisation: to say that the Indigénat has created ressentment would be an understatement. However it has proved to be a sure source of labour for the colonial effort and is supported by many prominent voices in government who argue that maintaining this status quo is necessary to prepare for the Reconquest."

NATFRA_New_Regions_idea_desc:0 "The old regional administrative divisions were carefully crafted to destroy regional identities and particularities. By reuniting long divided natural regions of France, we have largely contented loyal Frenchmen attached to their local cultures and traditions."

NATFRA_Comite_du_Salut_National:0 "구국위원회"
NATFRA_Comite_du_Salut_National_desc:0 "Henri Mordacq has formed with representatives from the democratic forces as well as the armed forces a Committee of National Salvation, a transitional authority before full restoration of democracy: indeed, we cannot allow our nation to be divided in this critical time, as the hour of reconquest grows ever closer."
NATFRA_Commisariat_au_Plan:0 "종합계획위원회"
NATFRA_Commisariat_au_Plan_desc:0 "To ensure that the homefront is perfectly well organised for the coming national effort, a commission made up of civilians and military men has been created to plan and coordinate the various initiatives for war readiness, the mobilisation of all the nation’s resources towards our sacred duty."
NATFRA_War_Credits:0 "전쟁채권"
NATFRA_War_Credits_desc:0 "There is a popular saying: “l’argent est le nerf de la guerre”, “money is the sinews of war”: indeed, the state must invest all that it can into the war effort and entice our people, rich or poor, to do the same, through war bonds and private investments. Our people must understand that this is after all a last ditch effort, and the full, enthusiastic participation of all is necessary."
NATFRA_Army_Supervision:0 "군 감독"
NATFRA_Army_Supervision_desc:0 "The Committee of National Salvation is a common effort between civilians and the armed forces, but who could better understand the needs of our armies than themselves? Some oversight from military men within the administration and industrial sector is to be expected, to ensure that full mobilisation can be implemented quickly whenever needed."
NATFRA_Aim_For_SelfSustainability:0 "자급을 위한 목표"
NATFRA_Aim_For_SelfSustainability_desc:0 "Though our allies in the Entente have assured us of their full support, we cannot simply hope for the best and rely on their generosity: everything must be done so that France can fully equip its forces using its own resources. We will ensure that the vast natural riches of Africa are fully mobilised, and that as little of them are wasted as exports: now is not the time for profits."
NATFRA_Dam_Construction:0 "댐 건설"
NATFRA_Dam_Construction_desc:0 "Our access to coal is limited, and oil must be saved for the armed forces: to make sure our people and industries have access to power, we will greatly invest in hydroelectric power. Algeria is after a land of many contrasts and the Atlas mountains are perfect to develop this source of energy."
NATFRA_Companies_des_Forges:0 "단조회사"
NATFRA_Companies_des_Forges_desc:0 "To make sure we are ready for the coming war, the government will meet representatives from the metallurgical industry, who had coordinated the armament industry during the Weltkrieg to great effect, to create a new, more centralised conglomerate dedicated entirely to serve the war effort."
NATFRA_Societes_Nationales:0 "Sociétés Nationales"
NATFRA_Societes_Nationales_desc:0 "For some essential industries, we cannot let anything get in the way of mobilisation: as such the government will start a wide policy of strategic nationalisation and investments, so that our forces have all the resources needed."
NATFRA_War_in_our_Plates:0 "접시 위의 전쟁"
NATFRA_War_in_our_Plates_desc:0 "All resources must be diverted towards the armed forces, for the liberation of France. This includes food, as before the war even starts we must create vast stockpiles of non-perishables goods: no soldier can fight on an empty stomach. As such a gradual rationing of essential goods will be implemented."
NATFRA_Policy_and_Strategy:0 "정책과 전략"
NATFRA_Policy_and_Strategy_desc:0 "Many of our Members of Parliament and state officials have some military experience, France is after all a nation of citizen-soldiers. However, they need to fully understand the stakes of the effort that is being asked of us all : frequent reports from the armed forces, as well as briefings on strategy and logistics, will ensure they have the tools to best serve the nation."
NATFRA_Our_Morale_Forces:0 "아군의 사기"
NATFRA_Our_Morale_Forces_desc:0 "Unfortunately, towards the end of the Weltkrieg many soldiers felt betrayed by their commanders and their government, leading some to even rebel and embrace socialism. To prevent such a situation from happening again, a new department has been formed, entirely dedicated to keeping morale high and making sure even the lowest of the infantrymen knows exactly why he fights."
NATFRA_Militarise_Society:0 "군사화된 사회"
NATFRA_Militarise_Society_desc:0 "Since the 1789 revolution, France has been a nation of citizens-soldiers, and military service is required of all men. We must draw on this tradition, on the “levée en masse” that saved the Republic when it was surrounded by tyrants and facing insurrection at home: strict discipline, respect of hierarchy and full mobilisation is to be expected of all our citizens."
NATFRA_Time_for_Action:0 "행동을 취할 시간!"
NATFRA_Time_for_Action_desc:0 "We can’t afford the stagnancy of the Pétain regime, the Comité will have to take decisive action to ensure we are ready for our sacred duty. However, unlike the occasionally byzantine junta, we will strive for transparency and utter efficiency, keeping our people informed of what is to, and must, be done."
NATFRA_Extended_Powers:0 "확대된 권한"
NATFRA_Extended_Powers_desc:0 "Now is not the time for petty disagreements and personal ambitions to amper our efforts: the Committee has been granted a wide mandate by the representatives of the people to do what must be done for France’s salvation, and we intend to take full advantage of it. Rule by decree and bypassing long parliamentary sessions for now, yes, but to ensure a future for democracy and France’s salvation."
NATFRA_Same_Blood_Tax_For_Everyone:0 "모두에게 똑같이 부과되는 혈세"
NATFRA_Same_Blood_Tax_For_Everyone_desc:0 "Conscription is an old and proud institution in France, something few could escape. However, these few exceptions, no matter small their number, created a narrative of elites being affected to easier duty for made-up medical reasons; of outright draft-dodgers: this ends now, we will fiercely combat any loophole so that our men know that each and everyone of them can count on their fellow citizens."
NATFRA_Salux_Patriae_Suprema_Lex_Esto:0 "국가의 안전이 최고의 법"
NATFRA_Salux_Patriae_Suprema_Lex_Esto_desc:0 "“The Salvation of the Nation is the Supreme Law”: if we were to fail in our sacred mission to retake our homeland, this would be the end of the Republic, the end of France. This cannot be allowed. Our nation now finally, truly united is ready to endure any and all sacrifices for the salvation of France, the highest priority of any true Frenchman."
NATFRA_Civilian_Heroism:0 "시민영웅주의"
NATFRA_Civilian_Heroism_desc:0 "Not everyone can be a soldier: some are too old or work critical jobs, some are wounded veterans of the Weltkrieg, some are still too young, some are even women! But this does not mean that they cannot serve France, and we must officially recognise their efforts on the homefront, as after all without them nothing could be done."
NATFRA_Rewards_For_Productivity:0 "생산성에 대한 보상"
NATFRA_Rewards_For_Productivity_desc:0 "In line with our effort of recognition of homefront, a system of rewards for exemplary productivity is being rolled out, starting with vouchers for better access to rations and bonus pay for exceeding quotas, all the way to medals and national recognition for exceptional workers: those on the home front might not shed blood for France, but sweat and tears are a worthy sacrifice to the Patrie."
NATFRA_Devoir_France_Devouement:0 "의무 프랑스 헌신"
NATFRA_Devoir_France_Devouement_desc:0 "Duty, France, Dedication, these three words must be the focus of every single one of our citizens, in complement of the traditional Republican motto of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. To finally be able to once again proudly proclaim the latter in the métropole, we must focus for now on the former."
NATFRA_National_Narrative:0 "민족서사"
NATFRA_National_Narrative_desc:0 "The Republic had conquered her own people through education: from our ancestors the Gauls, through the kings of the Middle Ages, to revolution, the destiny of France was clear: the creation of an enlightened republic, a shining beacon of liberty, equality and fraternity. Now one more chapter of this narrative must be written, together, thanks to our efforts: the reconquest of the métropole."

# Redressement #

NATFRA_Revolution_Nationale:0 "Révolution Nationale"
NATFRA_Revolution_Nationale_desc:0 "To the surprise of many, Pétain has held on to power thanks to swift help by the “French Revival” group. Democrats and reactionaries thought they could outmanoeuvre the Lion of Verdun and destroy France at this critical hour: they have been proved wrong, and now Pétain and the Redressement are free to implement the reforms needed for us to retake our home."
NATFRA_Give_Petain_ful_powers:0 "Give Pétain Full Powers"
NATFRA_Give_Petain_ful_powers_desc:0 "Pétain’s government has always attempted to maintain the illusion of normalcy, and had to compose with the differing sensibilities of our people. To finally let him truly carry out the reforms France needs, parliament will convey one last time to give him full powers, particularly constitutional powers, before voting to dissolve itself until the situation is stable enough."
NATFRA_Control_all_the_newspapers:0 "Controll all the Newspapers"
NATFRA_Control_all_the_newspapers_desc:0 "The Mordacq crisis has proved that for too long the government has left factious and unpatriotic elements in control of the press: with careful control of what is allowed to be published and careful screening of journalists, we will make sure that our people are properly informed."
NATFRA_Rally_Nationalists:0 "Rally the Nationalists"
NATFRA_Rally_Nationalists_desc:0 "The new regime has to prove itself to the most ardent nationalists, as many fear that it will simply perpetuate the stagnancy of the previous years: we will reach out to the most prominent patriotic voices to reassure them that the Marshal, now finally in full control, is and has always been the right choice for France, hopefully leading to a surge of volunteers to reclaim the Métropole."
NATFRA_Crush_the_Dissent:0 "Crush the Dissent"
NATFRA_Crush_the_Dissent_desc:0 "Though pro-Mordacq forces have been defeated and many now see that Pétain will lead us to victory, the Lion still faces dissent on all sides: democrats, royalists, even former loyalists who fear the influence the Redressement National has on the Marshal, uncertain of how much power he truly holds. By now, we can’t consider these people simply concerned citizens: they will be treated as traitors."
NATFRA_Replace_the_Constitution:0 "Replace the Constitution"
NATFRA_Replace_the_Constitution_desc:0 "A new constitution has been drafted by the Marshal’s government, evidently strongly influenced by the National Revival’s theories. Overhauling the decadent parliamentary democracy, enshrining technocratic and corporatist elements, this constitution grants near unlimited power to the “Head of the French State”: Philippe Pétain."
NATFRA_Order_and_Discipline:0 "Order and Discipline"
NATFRA_Order_and_Discipline_desc:0 "Sadly, we must recognise that the army once so loyal to the Lion has been one of the sources of the recent crisis, as men foolishly followed Mordacq. As the backbone of the regime, a thorough effort to root out agitators, reward loyalists and reinstate the strictest of discipline will be made. The war of reconquest looms, we cannot afford instability within the armed forces."
NATFRA_Notre_Grand_Pere_a_Tous:0 "Notre Grand-Père à Tous"
NATFRA_Notre_Grand_Pere_a_Tous_desc:0 "Philippe Pétain, the Lion of Verdun, a man who gives himself entirely to France and her people, like a caring patriarch, firm but loving, experienced and ready to make all the sacrifices for his family. The Marshal who has led us through the storm of the exile will continue to do so until our patrie is reborn e, the French nation finally truly united behind him."
NATFRA_Redressement_Francais:0 "Redressement Français"
NATFRA_Redressement_Francais_desc:0 "The French Resurgence group has proved an invaluable help to the Marshal in managing the recent crisis, and they have by now well earned the favors of Pétain, who has appointed these most competent men to the positions of influences needed to implement their reform efforts, thanks to which France will no doubt be led to victory."
NATFRA_Economic_Reform:0 "Economic Reforms"
NATFRA_Economic_Reform_desc:0 "France has always badly managed her economy, letting political passions control much of economic policy. The State must rebuild a trusting relationship with Capital, create advisory commissions of industrials, shrink the bureaucracy, reform our fiscality, protect property, and once and for all stop its ingerence in a field it has proved again and again it simply does not understand."
NATFRA_Gives_Back_Companies:0 "Give Back Companies"
NATFRA_Gives_Back_Companies_desc:0 "To deal with the titanic war effort of the Weltrkieg, the government was forced to nationalise many companies, and often managed them incredibly badly. Though the Pétain regime has been very supportive of the exiles in their implementation in Algeria, it has also often employed these barbarous tactics, with little care for property rights or efficiency: it’s time to right these wrongs."
NATFRA_Class_Collaboration:0 "Class Collaboration"
NATFRA_Class_Collaboration_desc:0 "French political discourse has often veered into unproductive discourse blaming the rich or the indigent for one societal ill or another: fertile ground for socialist agitation. But in the end, we are all French, united by our burning desire to free our countrymen. The government will promote groups advocating for class collaboration, and make sure those daring to speak of class war remain in the shadows."
NATFRA_Technological_Innovations:0 "Technological Innovations"
NATFRA_Technological_Innovations_desc:0 "It’s common sense that competition is the best way to stimulate innovation, and yet France has relentlessly tried to meddle in research and development, leading our great nation to lag behind the United States, Britain, and even Germany in the technological race. Let private enterprise and the market naturally weed out useless projects, before swooping in and bankrolling the worthy."
NATFRA_Private_Cooperation:0 "Private Cooperation"
NATFRA_Private_Cooperation_desc:0 "The State now finally contained within reasonable boundaries, the private sector can finally surge, fully support our cause and give back a thousandfold, full of thanks for the Lion who freed them from their stately shackles and moved by ever more intense patriotic fervor."
NATFRA_Social_Reform:0 "Social Reforms"
NATFRA_Social_Reform_desc:0 "The Redressement is made up of more generally wealthy people, that is undeniable. And though they have all certainly shined by their individual altruism, they recognise that as a class they should do more for the common man: as such a wide range of social reform agreed upon by committees made up of industrials, unions, and government representatives will be implemented."
NATFRA_Housing_Programms:0 "Housing Programs"
NATFRA_Housing_Programms_desc:0 "Though it has been more than a decade since the exile, many of our citizens who were forced to flee still live in unpleasant conditions, in overcrowded coastal cities: the government will buy empty land, encourage the building of decent housing, and give loans with advantageous rates to families and young couples to purchase their new homes."
NATFRA_Chantiers_de_Jeunesse:0 "Chantiers de Jeunesse"
NATFRA_Chantiers_de_Jeunesse_desc:0 "To support our youths and teach them useful skills, strong moral values, and respect of authority, we will make mandatory a months-long stay in youth camps inspired by scouting, where teenagers will accomplish community work, build strong bonds far from their usual lives, and prepare their mind and bodies for their years of military service once they reach adulthood."
NATFRA_Get_support_from_the_Clergy:0 "Get Support from the Clergy"
NATFRA_Get_support_from_the_Clergy_desc:0 "The Lion has maintained decent relations with the Church, but many among the clergy found themselves supporting our democratic or royalist opponents in the recent crisis, while others are skeptical of the economic aims of the Redressement. To try to win the Church over entirely, we will make sure to put an emphasis on our respect for religious liberty, and our hope for a moral state."
NATFRA_Rebuild_The_Morale_Order:0 "Rebuild the Moral Order"
NATFRA_Rebuild_The_Morale_Order_desc:0 "The Third Republic and it’s reckless liberalism and deeply anticlerical policies had degenerated into a corrupt, immoral mess that led France to defeat, that is plain to see. France must not fall into this pitfall again: we will work towards rebuilding order at all levels of society, crushing radicalism, and encouraging religious, moral education."
NATFRA_Travail_Famille_Patrie:0 "Travail, Famille, Patrie"
NATFRA_Travail_Famille_Patrie_desc:0 "Work, Family, Fatherland, these are the words on the mind of all true Frenchmen, this is the motto that must sweep away the excesses of the old Republic and bring forward the new State, so that one day we might accomplish our sacred duty: the liberation of France from her red shackles, thanks to the guidance of the Marshal, the Lion, the Hero of Verdun beloved by all, Phillipe Pétain."

# Action Française #

NATFRA_Politique_Dabord:0 "Politique D'Abord!"
NATFRA_Politique_Dabord_desc:0 "After months of political instability, the Action Française stands triumphant: Charles de Gaulle has asked in front of parliament the Duke de Guise  to seize the crown and for the kingdom to be reborn. Finally, the Republic will be swept away, and led by our king we will once again rise to glory."
NATFRA_Restauration:0 "Restauration"
NATFRA_Restauration_desc:0 "Vive le Roi ! The Kingdom is reborn, and though much work remains to be done, we are almost ready to take the first step towards the salvation of France: the coronation of Jean d’Orléans as rightful king of France. A sumptuous ceremony and nationwide public celebrations are hastily being planned, following as closely as possible the traditions of the French crown."
NFA_restauration_focus_tt:0 "The focus will automatically be completed after the crowning ceremony is organised.\n"
NATFRA_Bring_back_Aristocracy:0 "Bring Back Aristocracy"
NATFRA_Royal_Dictatorship:0 "Royal Dictatorship"
NATFRA_Royal_Dictatorship_desc:0 "In this critical hour, a dictatorship must be set up to lead the difficult transition away from the decadent République. Not a dictatorship of parties, of elected officials, which would quickly fall into despotism and the very same corruption the republic suffered from, but a royal dictatorship, above petty party quarrels, tempered by a millennium of traditions and paternal care for public interests."
NATFRA_Decentralisation:0 "Decentralisation"
NATFRA_Decentralisation_desc:0 "The Revolution did all it could to destroy the structures of the kingdom of France: power was taken away from the provinces, and concentrated in the hands of “representatives” sent to Paris. This proved to be prone to corruption and inefficient to address local concerns. We will start to right the wrongs of our forefathers by systematically devoluting power away from the capital."
NATFRA_Protective_Inequality:0 "Protective Inequality"
NATFRA_Protective_Inequality_desc:0 "The demagogic liberals pretended to make all men equals: this was of course folly. Instead, the State must work towards a repartition of societal roles that is beneficial to all, encouraging traditional and natural structures while preventing any excesses that might foster resentment among the lower classes: not out of a pipe dream of “equality”, but out of a lucid sense of care for our subjects."
NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter:0 "The Eldest Daughter of the Church"
NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter_desc:0 "France is the Elder Daughter of the Church, home of countless saints and faithful heroes, defending the Faith at every turn, even blessed with saintly kings like Saint Louis. That is, until the revolution and the 1905 Laws: we must repent for these errors and restore the Church to her rightful position. From godless republic, we will be reborn as a sacramental kingdom."
NATFRA_Localism:0 "Localism"
NATFRA_Localism_desc:0 "We will restore the institutions of the French Kingdom: municipal councils, regional parliaments, professional assemblies, guilds, etc. The Crown will set policy and decide what no one else could, but anything that could be decided on a local level should be so. Furthermore, justice and policing will be handled locally, following local laws and local traditions."
NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures:0 "Protect the Provincial Cultures"
NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures_desc:0 "The République sought to destroy regional cultures and languages, dialects forbidden for anything official, particularly education, while in the empire little respect was shown to local traditions,  seen as oddities soon swept away by so-called “progress”. But it is the Republic that has been swept away, and so we will follow a policy of promotion of the diversity of France and her people."
NATFRA_Corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
NATFRA_Corporatism_desc:0 "The Social Doctrine of the Church rejects socialism and unrestricted capitalism and supports workers’ rights to organise. Inspired by this and traditional institutions, our subjects will come together to form corporations, in the spirit of the guilds of old. In the past, the King protected the lower classes, abandoned, they became slaves of worshippers of Mammon: we say, no more!"
NATFRA_Clacissism:0 "Classicism"
NATFRA_Clacissism_desc:0 "The origin of the revolution lies in the Reformation and the Enlightenment: instead, we will foster their opposite, classicism, refining of the genius of the ancient Greeks and Romans through a thoroughly French lens: the stoic sobriety and wisdom of the Ancients will prevent decadence from taking root again in France."
NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism:0 "End Parliamentarism"
NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism_desc:0 "The Third Republic was weak, ineffective in times of crisis and incapable of conducting the policies needed for France to maintain her rank among nations. France suffered from a lack of clear direction, her people divided: the king has ended this petty squabble masquerading as democracy, and will lead from now on his subjects towards glory."
NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel:0 "Le Pays Réel"
NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel_desc:0 "We are getting ever closer to freeing the “pays réel”, from its shackles imposed by the “pays légal”,  a few thousand individuals, speaking for millions, more concerned with their little quarrels between mediocre so-called elite. But the real country, once artificially divided, its roots slowly undermined, once fooled by the Geuse, is now united under the king: the damage done since 1789 will be undone."
NATFRA_Exalt_Aristocracy:0 "Exalt the Aristocracy"

NATFRA_General_Estienne_Legacy_desc:0 "General Jean Estienne brought critical innovation to the French army, pioneering aerial reconnaissance, after the exile organising an in-depth exploration of the Sahara, but most importantly, he was the first to recognise the potential of tanks and theorise their tactical and strategic use. He had brought us so close to victory in the Weltkrieg: his legacy lives on in our forces today."

NATFRA_Infiltration_Tactics_desc:0 "Infiltration tactics, that is the use of experienced units to bypass strongpoints and better attack them from a more favorable point were used with great effect by German storm troops in the latter part of the Weltkrieg.

NATFRA_Total_Air_War:0 "Total Air War"
NATFRA_Total_Air_War_desc:0 "Many of the younger generation of officers argue for large scale use of air support for the infantry, but others have also suggested that we should not shy away from using our air force to destroy enemy infrastructure and industry in a more generalised manner: we are not in a position to avoid total war, and turning the enemies' ressources to rubble can only help us."

NATFRA_Aircraft_Production:0 "Aircraft Production"
NATFRA_Aircraft_Production_desc:0 "The aircraft industry exploded during the Weltkrieg, and the government has made sure to generously subsidize it to facilitate its implementation in Algeria.

With war finally on the horizon, we will mobilise the industry to the fullest."
NATFRA_Long_Range_Fighter:0 "Long Range Fighter"
NATFRA_Long_Range_Fighter_desc:0 "Corsica might be a floating airfield from which our planes can easily reach the mainland, but we nevertheless need fighters capable of patrolling the vast expanses of the Mediterreanean as well as escort our bombers deep into red territory to destroy the Commune’s industry.

NATFRA_New_Air_Tactics:0 "New Air Tactics"
NATFRA_New_Air_Tactics_desc:0 "The field of military aviation is a rapidly changing one, and our pilots must adapt their skills to ever changing technology: with new aircrafts come new possibilities of offensive and defensive manoeuvres, new ways of coming out of a tense dogfight: extensive training in these new tactical advances will give an edge over our enemies."

NATFRA_Ministry_of_Naval_Affairs_desc:0 "The Ministry of Naval Affairs, once tasked with overseeing the administration of both our colonies and our naval forces, is now solely dedicated to the needs of the Navy: control of Mediterrean will be essential to retake the Métropole, as such the ministry will make sure that our navy can stand up to the Internationale."
NATFRA_A_World_Class_Navy:0 "A World-Class Navy"
NATFRA_A_World_Class_Navy_desc:0 "Most of the French navy accompanied our government in exile to North Africa, as such our navy is large but many of our ships are outdated. In its current state the navy could defend our shores, but it is uncertain how it would fare if someone were to attempt to contest our hold on the Western Mediterrenean. We will strive for a large scale overhaul."
NATFRA_An_African_Toulon:0 "An African Toulon"
NATFRA_An_African_Toulon_desc:0 "Toulon was the primary base of the Mediterrean fleet before the war, but since the exile it has been stationed on lake Bizerte, a large laguna in northern Tunisia intensively developed by colonial authorities, with in particular a large arsenal in Ferryville. To meet our ambitions, Bizerte will be overhauled and developed further."
NATFRA_Heavy_Destroyers:0 "Heavy Destroyers"
NATFRA_Heavy_Destroyers_desc:0 "France’s navy has always been developed with the assumption that it would fight a superior force. In the last century, a movement called the “Jeune École” advocated for the use of many smaller ships instead of large dreadnoughts: this idea is now outdated. The ministry will instead encourage the development of well-armed destroyers, a middle ground between our traditional doctrines and the international trends."
NATFRA_Aviation_Cruisers:0 "Aviation Cruisers"
NATFRA_Aviation_Cruisers_desc:0 "The field of naval aviation has been somewhat left behind by the international community, locked in a permanent arms race: this is a race we could not win, instead we will radically change our doctrine and encourage the use of air power in naval warfare, for reconnaissance and precision strikes."
NATFRA_Sea_Leviathans:0 "Sea Leviathans"
NATFRA_Sea_Leviathans_desc:0 "We might not be able to compete with Germany or Japan in the naval arms race, but we certainly can attempt to knock out any of our Mediterrean opponents with well armed heavy battleships: this might go against previous doctrines, but our current situation means it is time for some innovation."
NATFRA_Air_Carriers:0 "Air Carriers"
NATFRA_Air_Carriers_desc:0 "The current naval arms race is misguided: by developing aircraft carriers, we will ensure that we can keep control over the Meditterean by bombing our enemies and sinking them to the depths of the sea before we are even within range of their guns."
NATFRA_Preparing_Our_Return:0 "Preparing Our Return"
NATFRA_Preparing_Our_Return_desc:0 "To reconquer the métropole, we need to land on its shore, a fight that the Commune has been expecting for two decennies: it will be anything but simple. We must prepare as much as we can, as there will be no second chance. The Ministry will invest in the development of anything that could help our amphibious assault."
NATFRA_Invasion_Logistics:0 "Invasion Logistics"
NATFRA_Invasion_Logistics_desc:0 "However, the amphibious assault is merely the first part, we must ensure that our troops can secure a lasting bridgehead.

NATFRA_The_U_Boat_Menace:0 "Develop the Forces Sous-Marines"
NATFRA_The_U_Boat_Menace_desc:0 "The Commune lacks many resources essential to the modern war effort, most importantly, oil.

NATFRA_Battaile_Escadres:0 "Bataille d'Escadres"
NATFRA_Battaile_Escadres_desc:0 "The battle for the Mediterranean won’t be won with a single engagement, and we need to think strategically.

Covert operations and counter-intelligence will no doubt be just as important in the future, and so our intelligence services will have to be expanded."
NATFRA_Nuclear_Science:0 "Salvage Damocles" #Nuclear Tech Boost
NATFRA_Nuclear_Science_desc:0 "The Internationale had started developing nuclear research, in the hopes of creating an ultimate, war-ending weapon. They were defeated before they had time to unleash this, but we will salvage this research and further it, so that atom might serve the greatness of France instead of the revolution."
NATFRA_Rocket_Science:0 "Develop the Fusées" #Rocket Tech
NATFRA_Rocket_Science_desc:0 "Rockets played a minor role in the war, either mounted on trucks or even carrying flying bombs without the need of a pilot. The latter is certainly a concept to expand, as this could mean being able to strike distant targets in near impunity."
NATFRA_Rocket_Planes:0 "Réaction Propulsion" #Jet Tech
NATFRA_Rocket_Planes_desc:0 "Plans for jet-propelled planes had been made but never came to fruition: the exile had divided French resources in the development of military aviation, but we are now reunited. We will develop planes capable of outmanoeuvring any of our enemies and assert their air superiority no matter who we face."

Our time in exile has shown us the need to avoid diplomatic isolation, and so we will reach out to both our allies and the Germans, despite our enmities."
NATFRA_Nancy_Question:0 "The Nancy Question" #Gib Nanzig pls
NATFRA_Nancy_Question_desc:0 "The twenty-year lease on the occupied territory of Nancy following our defeat in the first Weltkrieg has drawn to a close. With the Commune destroyed and a responsible government once more seated in Paris, it is time to request the return of Nancy from the Germans."
NATFRA_Franco_German_Thaw:0 "Franco-German Thaw" #Cool the relations
NATFRA_Franco_German_Thaw_desc:0 "With the return of Nancy, it may be time to work towards burying the hatchet with the Germans. Their help, much as we loathe to admit it, was necessary for us to return to the Métropole, and plunging Europe into another war we would struggle to win might be folly."
NATFRA_Franco_German_Trade:0 "Franco-German Trade" #Trade Up with Mitteleuropa, slightly down with Entente
NATFRA_Franco_German_Trade_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the German Empire is now the dominant power in Europe, both militarily and most importantly economically, despite the recent economic meltdown.

NATFRA_Congress_of_Verdun_desc:0 "Germany and France have long been rivals: no place is a better representative of this than Verdun, this gate between two great nations where so many fell in 1916. It is also where in 843, France and Germany were first separated by the heirs of Charlemagne. Many diplomats are hoping it could also be where a congress for lasting peace is called, and perhaps where a new Franco-German relationship could be born."

NATFRA_Prepare_For_War_desc:0 "The Boches have proved time and time again that they are forever the enemies of the people of France.

NATFRA_Kings_Made_France_desc:0 "France was born in 508 with the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks: since then, his descendants have reigned upon France and led her countless times to glory. France was built by the tireless efforts of her kings, and without them she was nothing: orphaned, she erred and fell. But this tragedy is over, long live the King!"
NATFRA_Pays_Naturels:0 "Recognize the Pays Naturels"
NATFRA_Pays_Naturels_desc:0 "In an effort to destroy the true France, the Republicans in their manic obsession with rationality created entirely artificial administrative subdivisions, denying any local identities, dialects and traditions, going as far as imposing the Parisian dialect as “proper” French. We will undo this injustice and recognize the various natural and cultural regions within France."
NATFRA_Province_Parliament:0 "Restore the Provincial Parliaments"
NATFRA_Province_Parliament_desc:0 "The realm had traditionally been divided between various provinces, each with their own assemblies tasked with administering their area according to local rights and privileges, ensuring that each part of France was ruled in a perfectly tailored way. These provincial parliaments were of course abolished by the Revolution, ending centuries of harmonious autonomy: they will be restored."
NATFRA_Expand_Camelot:0 "Expand the Camelots"
NATFRA_Expand_Camelot_desc:0 "The Camelots du Roi, youths originally tasked with selling the Action Française newspaper, have evolved into an intensely loyal paramilitary force. By making membership mandatory for youngsters and organising youth camps inspired by scouting to teach useful skills as well as instill strong religious values and respect of authority, we will be able to undo the damage inflicted by the Commune upon the young generation."
NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny:0 "Authority not Tyranny"
NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny_desc:0 "Much like subordination is not slavery, authority must not be tyranny. The King must and will be akin to a loving father, firm when needed, ready to give impartial justice, but otherwise leaving his children, the people, free to enjoy their natural rights and exercise their traditional privileges and freedoms."
NATFRA_Honour_House_France:0 "Glorify the House of France"
NATFRA_Honour_House_France_desc:0 "The House of France, that is the royal family, have proved time and time again their personal qualities. Brave, pious, intelligent, caring, each a worthy descendant of Saint Louis and model for all of us. Some of our freed countrymen might still be coming to terms with the restored monarchy, we must make sure they know how lucky they are to be once again led by the Dynasty."
NATFRA_Social_Doctrine:0 "Enforce the Social Doctrine"
NATFRA_Social_Doctrine_desc:0 "The Social Doctrine of the Church is a wide ranging compendium of teachings related to the Common Good of society. More than political ideas, they are a moral imperative for any true Catholic to follow, demanding subsidiarity, solidarity, and human dignity. As the monarch of the Eldest Daughter of the Church, the king will ensure that these principles are scrupulously followed by all."
NATFRA_Consecrate_Heart:0 "Consecration to the Immaculate Heart"
NATFRA_Consecrate_Heart_desc:0 "Since 1638, France has been consecrated to the Virgin Mary, now eternal Queen of France. But to show our gratitude towards the Holy Mother for her protection which permitted us to reconquer her kingdom, we will renew this vow, this time consecrating the realm to her Immaculate Heart, symbol of her compassionate love for all people."
NATFRA_Blame_et_Accuse:0 "Blame the Gueuse, Accuse the Boches"
NATFRA_Blame_et_Accuse_desc:0 "Because of the pathetic elites of the Republic, the war was lost. Then, much like the Germans had encouraged the existence of the Gueuse to weaken France in 1871, they inoculated the nation with the socialist plague during the Great War. They wanted France weak and divided: no more! The king has finally returned, our misled people have awoken, and the Anti-France, republican or syndicalist, has been cast out."
NATFRA_Coopt_Cercle_Proudhon:0 "Found the Cercle Proudhon"
NATFRA_Coopt_Cercle_Proudhon_desc:0 "We will create a "Cercle Proudhon", a think-tank made up of National-Syndicalist leaders inspired by the works of Proudhon, Sorel, and more surprisingly, Charles Maurras. They are the most amiable of the syndicalist factions: we will make use of their popularity to help our people make peace with the new order."
NATFRA_Prole_no_More:0 "Proletarians no More!"
NATFRA_Prole_no_More_desc:0 "The 1789 Revolution stripped our people of their traditional rights and privileges, turning them into an exploited class, the proletariat at the mercy of Capital. The Anti-France capitalised on their righteous anger, leading them further astray. No more! Their rights restored, there is no longer a single proletarian in France, only proud artisans, proud peasants, proud workers."
NATFRA_Integral_Monarch:0 "The King Saved Her!"
NATFRA_Integral_Monarch_desc:0 "The real France has long suffered under the tyranny of her enemies, whether they be parasitic republicans or ungodly socialists.

No one would dare to question the Marshal or his allies of the Redressement Français after accomplishing such a feat, and they are free to reform France according to their agendas."
NATFRA_Remember_Verdun:0 "Rekindle the Memory of Verdun"
NATFRA_Remember_Verdun_desc:0 "Though Pétain has been viciously slandered by Communard propaganda for years, even this effort could not make Frenchmen forget that he is the man who led them towards victory at Verdun and greatly improved living conditions at the front. An entire generation still vividly remembers his fateful call: “They shall not pass!”. We will make full use of this to reconcile our people with the new regime."
NATFRA_Restore_Religious_Freedom:0 "Restore Religious Freedom"
NATFRA_Restore_Religious_Freedom_desc:0 "The deeply anticlerical leftists sought to break the Church. Though state atheism was too much of a risk for the Communards to take, the faithful were derided and bombarded with propaganda, religious education was banned, and public expression of religion was hardly constrained. No more: though France remains a secular state, this antagonisation of religion will immediately stop."
NATFRA_Incentivise_Philanthropy:0 "Incentivize Philanthropy"
NATFRA_Incentivise_Philanthropy_desc:0 "The State will always be inefficient to meet the people’s needs, and a welfare state would only encourage parasitism: instead the more philanthropic among our people will be encouraged by tax breaks and honours to donate to and care for the needy, so that one day state socialism will be fully dismantled."
NATFRA_Denounce_Party_Politics:0 "Denounce Party Politics"
NATFRA_Denounce_Party_Politics_desc:0 "The Third Republic fell into instability, which led us to our defeat in the Weltkrieg, while the Marshal had to put a stop to the petty infighting of the exiled Fourth Republic. Clearly, party politics are to blame for much of this, as individuals chose their group interests over what was best for France. Elected officials will no longer affiliate with parties, and instead will have to shine of their own merit."
NATFRA_Perm_Advisors:0 "Apolitical Permanent Advisors"
NATFRA_Perm_Advisors_desc:0 "Too often, the French governments and lawmakers put in place legislation without knowing the first thing about the topic in question, whether that be industry, science or the economy. As such the Marshal will appoint permanent, apolitical technical advisors to every committee, every commission, to ensure that the uninformed mistakes of the past do not occur again."
NATFRA_Electoral_System:0 "Streamlined Electoral System"
NATFRA_Electoral_System_desc:0 "The Republican electoral system was far too prone to being abused by the whims of a people easily whisked into frenzy. To prevent the instability that led to the downfall of France, we will deeply reform it. Longer mandates, less MPs, merely partial renewal of parliament, of course empowering the executive or creating a Supreme Court will surely make for more rational politics."
NATFRA_Disinterested_Experts:0 "A Government of Disinterested Experts"
NATFRA_Disinterested_Experts_desc:0 "No longer will France be run into the ground by inept professional politicians, instead it will thrive under the guidance of pragmatic men, free from the influence of any parties, no longer slaves to political passions, who have worked and succeeded on their own before being called to serve France."
NATFRA_Dismantle_Red_Virus:0 "Dismantle the Red Virus"
NATFRA_Dismantle_Red_Virus_desc:0 "Like an insidious malady, socialism has spread over the last century in French consciousnesses, from deranged intellectuals, to politicians, to the humblest of laborers. It first led to economic stagnancy, then instability, and finally revolution and civil war. If we want to avoid reliving the same nightmare, this red plague must be fought in every aspect of life, meticulously rooted out."
NATFRA_Admin_Reorg:0 "Administrative Reorganization"
NATFRA_Admin_Reorg_desc:0 "The pre-war administration was simply a waste. Too many subdivisions, too many bureaucrats, using too many resources and creating too many regulations, which led to increased taxes, less productivity, less production. Simply put, administrative red tape merely stifled the best and brightest while only increasing the burden on others: it’s time to cut it down to the minimum."
NATFRA_End_State_Meddle:0 "End State Meddling"
NATFRA_End_State_Meddle_desc:0 "The French Republic has countless times pathetically attempted to participate in the economy, leading more often than not to embarrassing failure: bureaucrats who have hardly ever held a real job are simply not well versed in the subtle art of profit. It’s time to end this masquerade and restrict the role of the state to what it does best: hold up the rule of Law."

NATFRA_Revive_National_Bloc:0 "Revive the National Bloc"
NATFRA_Revive_National_Bloc_desc:0 "It is the duty of every Frenchman to stand tall against the ever-lurking socialist threat: a broad coalition of right-wing parties, from more traditional Catholics conservatives to the PSF, has won the day, decisively showing that our people want to once and for all put behind them the errors of the past."
NATFRA_Maintain_Military_Rule:0 "Maintain Military Rule"
NATFRA_Maintain_Military_Rule_desc:0 "France is simply not yet ready to return to democracy, too many threats seeking to tear apart the Republic are lurking. Our armed forces so recently crowned with the laurels of victory will temporarily hold on to power until stability is fully restored and democratic life can safely resume."

NATFRA_Administrative_Decentralization:0 "Administrative Decentralization"
NATFRA_Administrative_Decentralization_desc:0 "Attempting to undo decades of syndicalist efforts in decentralisation would be simply foolish: while France has since the dawn of the Republic been a very centralised nation, there is nothing stopping us from simply adapting to this new status quo, and reform it to better fit the restored order."
NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms:0 "Legitimize Reformist Unions"
NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms_desc:0 "Denied reform, workers turned to violence and class warfare in the hope of bettering their conditions, and thus was born the revolution. To prevent such tragedy, dialogue between capital and labour must happen and reform must be possible: unions that officially renounce revolutionary rhetoric will be welcomed back within workplaces, even if they profess some form of socialism."
NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws:0 "Negotiate New Labor Laws"
NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws_desc:0 "Under the auspices of the government, labour and capital, as well as representatives from various parties and interest groups, have joined together to discuss reforms to labour laws, often sidestepped in the wake of the syndicalist defeat. Our people can and must be confident in the Republic’s tireless defence of their interests."
NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty:0 "Abolish the Death Penalty"
NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty_desc:0 "In 1791 already our forefathers had passionate debates relating to the end of capital punishment, and since then our great men, such as Hugo, Gambetta, Clemenceau, Jaurès have tirelessly advocated for the abolition of the death penalty. It is finally time to take this step forward: the bloodlust of the guillotine has been satiated by these decades of fratricidal conflict."
NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services:0 "Nationalize Public Services"
NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services_desc:0 "Desyndicalisation has occasionally strayed zealously and aggressively far, in some domains leading to a drop in quality of life of our citizens: to correct this error, some public services will be nationalised, in order to deploy them according to the public interest and not profit."
NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms:0 "Expand Welfare Reforms"
NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms_desc:0 "Continuing and expanding the solidaristic welfare programs in the vein of the Radical traditions will ensure that our people, still reeling from the war and struggling to rebuild our nation, will still be able to live decently and won’t find themselves falling into nostalgia for the syndicalist regime."

NATFRA_Protect_Secular_Traditions_desc:0 "The 1905 laws on the Separation of the Churches and the State enshrined laïcité, strict secularism, as one of the pillars of the French Republic.

NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos:0 "Disband the Dispos"
NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos_desc:0 "The PSF’s security service, the “Dispos” have teetered on the brink of paramilitarism for too long: they have had their use in defending our fledgeling reborn democracy, but we cannot tolerate that private citizens attempt to bypass legitimate law enforcement to maintain order.

NATFRA_Reinstitute_Republican_School_desc:0 "When the Republic was still young and fragile, it’s mandatory, free education that solidified her position and conquered the hearts and minds of the French nation to Republican values and ideals. The Republic might be triumphant now, but much remains to be done to heal the scars of the last decades, and once again schools will be a critical battleground of ideas."
NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech:0 "Enshrine Freedom of Speech"
NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech_desc:0 "One of the fundamental rights outlined by the 1789 Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen was freedom of speech. Since then, this right has often been contested: both Communard authorities and the Pétain junta made liberal use of censorship, but no more! Freedom of speech shall be exalted as one of the pillars of the Republic."

NATFRA_Reorganize_the_Departments:0 "Reorganise the Departments"
NATFRA_Reorganize_the_Departments_desc:0 "The Commune had abolished the departments, the base administrative division of France. Designed to destroy feudal and cultural boundaries in 1789, they were decried as bourgeois, a remnant of the tyranny of so-called Reason. This abolition fostered regionalist sentiment: they will be restored, for a better, more efficient administration of France One and Indivisible, without caving to petty localisms."
NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism:0 "Fight Regionalism"
NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism_desc:0 "The federal nature of the Commune has emboldened regionalists, and some are openly asking for autonomy for their regions, particularly in Brittany and even in Corsica. Every inch given to these groups is one closer to separatism. Thankfully France has moved past such remnants of the past, she is One and Indivisible!"
NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations:0 "Normalize Church Relations"
NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations_desc:0 "Relations between the Catholic Church and the Republic have been tense, to say the least, and since 1905 separation of Church and State official diplomatic relations had broken down. However, the Weltkrieg and our common opposition to the Commune has brought us closer, and we must now seek appeased relations with the Holy See."
NATFRA_Combat_Polarization:0 "Combat Polarization"
NATFRA_Combat_Polarization_desc:0 "Crypto-Communards to the left, reactionaries to the right, here we are in the centre and we must stick together to prevent either kind of despotism from toppling the Republic once again. Politics must not be allowed to fall back into violent rhetoric and irreconcilable oppositions: the name of the game is compromise and unity against radicals."

NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness:0 "Privatisation Frenzy"
NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness_desc:0 "So much was seized and collectivised by the Commune that there is no way that a functional economy could be rebuilt if we just accepted the status quo: mass privatisation must continue to help France recreate a market economy."
NATFRA_Create_New_Elite:0 "Create a New Patronal Elite"
NATFRA_Create_New_Elite_desc:0 "Much of the old industrial elites had compromised themselves by throwing themselves at the feet of the military junta, and some whispers that they had plans of outright taking over the state apparatus. Frankly, they can’t be trusted. Through the strategic use of government contracts and investments, we will make sure that the right kind of Republican patriots succeeds in the future."
NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie:0 "Expand the Gendarmerie"
NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie_desc:0 "The Gendarmerie must be expanded and reinforced to enforce order on the rural areas of France, still occasionally plagued by Communard remnants and where the devastation of the war and decollectivisation has left many in difficult situations, with some turning to crime and the Black Market."
NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists:0 "Discredit Republican-Socialists"
NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists_desc:0 "The left-wing of the Radicals, who had thrown their lot in with the Revolution, before being marginalised by more radical socialist elements, are attempting to come crawling back to the Republic: we mustn't let traitors and crypto-Syndicalists infiltrate the halls of power."

NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers:0 "Reinforce Presidential Powers"
NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers_desc:0 "The Third Republic was notoriously unstable: we cannot make the same mistakes as our predecessors, some sort of check on parliamentary power is needed.

NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare:0 "Catholic Social Welfare"
NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare_desc:0 "According to the social teachings of the Church, Christian solidarity requires that the state protects the dignity and well-being of our fellow man. As such, extensive welfare reform must take place, and private charity efforts will be strongly encouraged and subsidised."
NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists:0 "Integrate Christian Regionalists"
NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists_desc:0 "The Church demands subsidiarity, that is to say, that political decisions should be taken at the local level whenever possible, and the centralising urge of the Republic is rather Jacobin in nature. It is only just to welcome those who desire to protect their local traditions, particularly their attachment to the Faith. France is One, but denying her local particularities is foolish."

NATFRA_Christian_Unions_desc:0 "Pope Leo XII outlined in the encyclical Rerum Novarum the mutual duties and rights of capital and labour: among these is the right to unionise, and since then faithful Catholics workers have come together to defend their rights in faith-minded unions. These must be heavily promoted, to counterbalance any kind of remnant of socialist rhetoric among the working class."

NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures:0 "Establish Regional Prefectures"
NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures_desc:0 "The prefects and sub-prefects are the direct representatives of the state at the local level, with many responsibilities such as law enforcement. They are meant to be neutral checks on elected local authorities, freely nominated by the government. To prevent any future risk of instability, their powers will be extended and their total loyalty to the Republic ensured."
NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes:0 "Restore Churches and Parishes"
NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes_desc:0 "Though the Commune was not an explicitly atheistic state, it was certainly ferociously anticlerical, and many of our churches have suffered from lack of resources, if not from hostile acts, and war. We will embark on a large-scale restoration effort, providing work and an opportunity to expiate the errors of the past for many."
NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws:0 "Blasphemy Laws"
NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws_desc:0 "With a new Concordat in place, blasphemy laws will follow. Freedom of speech is, of course, an undeniable right, but freedom ends where the rights of others start: an offence against the religion of the majority of Frenchmen cannot be tolerated, especially as freedom of religion was so often abused by Communards acting under the mask of secularism."
NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat:0 "Sign a New Concordat"
NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat_desc:0 "The 1905 Laws of Separation of Churches and State were a tragedy engineered by radicals: denying the Catholic nature of France is simply a denial of reality and a deep injustice. A new Concordat will be agreed to with the Holy See, and France once again will proudly deserve her title of Eldest Daughter of the Church, a first step to restoring the place of the Faith in our nation."

NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree:0 "Rule by Decree"
NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree_desc:0 "To counter the revolutionary threat, an efficient government is needed. The new military junta under Colonel de La Rocque will not bother itself with the pageantry of parliamentary democracy: until order and stability are assured, decisions will be taken and applied by the Colonel, on the advice of patriotic experts in their fields."
NATFRA_Privatizations_For_Loyalty:0 "Privatizations For Loyalty"
NATFRA_Privatizations_For_Loyalty_desc:0 "To rebuild a functional market economy, privatisation is needed. But to ensure that the best men reap the profits of the renewed greatness of the French nation, it is patriots, loyal to France and the Colonel, that will be prioritised in the sale of formerly public assets."
NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists:0 "Hunt Down Crypto-Syndicalists"
NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists_desc:0 "Thorough purges of syndicalist elements have already taken place, but among newly professed loyalists the Republic hides many crypto-socialists, waiting for the right opportunity to strike again. Radical-socialists, “reformist” unionists, pardoned officers, they will all be investigated and interrogated. Socialism will not be allowed to attack the French nation again."
NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role:0 "The Social Role of the Engineer"
NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role_desc:0 "The engineer is both a skilled technician and worker, and as such is the perfect link between the popular classes and capital. Engineers must add to their professional and technical skills a deep understanding of our institutions promoting class cooperation so that peace in the workplace can be guaranteed by patriots conscious of the importance of their duty to France."
NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies:0 "Expand Corporatist Policies"
NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies_desc:0 "France fell because of class conflict because neither capital nor workers respected their mutual duties to each other because they focused on ultimately petty issues of profit instead of their much greater mission: their duty towards their patrie. The government will ensure that these errors will not be repeated, and that class tensions are subjugated by Catholic brotherhood and love for France."
NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System:0 "Patriotic Technical School System"
NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System_desc:0 "The youths of France are distraught, lost in a new world: a system of patriotic technical schools will be created, for them to learn the practical skills that will be demanded of them in the workforce, as well as through apprenticeship and hands-on experience. From the lost children of the syndicalist cause, we will create a generation of workers proudly helping to rebuild the motherland."

NATFRA_A_Social_Republic:0 "A Social Republic"
NATFRA_A_Social_Republic_desc:0 "The Republic must be a loving, caring mother to her children and ensure to them all safety, well-being, healthcare, access to education, and a right to work. The syndicalist revolution was brought on by the terrible conditions of the working masses, leading France down towards a dark path out of desperation: the reborn Republic will not make the mistakes that tore her apart again."
NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic:0 "A Liberal Republic"
NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic_desc:0 "The Republic must be an impartial mother to her children, offering them all manners of freedom and liberty regardless of personal circumstances. Against all odds, the liberal ideals of the Third Republic have been kept alive despite anarchy and tyranny: the Republic reborn brandishes the torch of Liberty and once again shines bright, a true example to all lovers of Reason."
NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic:0 "A Catholic Republic"
NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic_desc:0 "In 1892, Pope Leo XIII had called on French Catholics to accept the Republic, to take France back from anti-Catholic forces. Despite unceasing persecution from liberals to socialists, the faithful have worked tirelessly, and half a century later, it has been done. Through our efforts, the French Republic has finally been baptised and never again will anyone question the piety of the Eldest Daughter."
NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic:0 "A Strong Republic"
NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic_desc:0 "The Third Republic fell because of its chaotic nature. This error led to defeat and exile: our reborn Republic will not allow the foolishness of the past to be repeated. Thanks to the leadership of the Colonel, under whom we are all united, France will rise again, her children united in a common purpose, the restoration of her glory.\nUnité!"

NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic:0 "Proclaim the Fourth Republic"
NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic_desc:0 "To refound the Republic on stronger foundations, leaving the past truly behind, a new constitution has been drafted.

NATFRA_Social_D_abord:0 "Social d'Abord"
NATFRA_Social_D_abord_desc:0 "Colonel de La Rocque has led France through her darkest hour and will lead for the foreseeable future, to profoundly reforge the Republic and ensure that the tragedy that has torn apart our nation for the last decades never occurs again. Our people finally reunited will not let itself be divided again by the enemies of France.\nVive le Colonel! Vive la France!"

nfa.1.t:0 "프랑스 공화국의 상황 - 역사"
nfa.1.d:0 "제3공화국은 그 전 정권과 같이 독일군에 의해 패배하고 사회주의자들의 저항에 직면하며 멸망하는 운명을 맞았습니다. 1920년의 코뮌 혁명 이후 발발한 내전이 종결되었을 때, 정부는 항복이 아닌 망명을 선택했습니다. 정부는 마르세유로 후퇴해 프랑스 해군 선단을 타고 알제로 향하며, 신생 프랑스 코뮌 연맹이 의심의 여지없이 빠르게 자멸하거나 독일놈들에게 무너져 상황이 빠르게 해결되리라 믿고 있었습니다. 하지만, 둘 중 어떠한 일도 벌어지지 않았고 독일 제국은 망명한 기존 정부의 입장을 전혀 고려하지 않은 채 코뮌과 평화 협정을 맺었습니다. 코뮌은 새롭게 재편된 독일 동맹체계 소속국들에게 프랑스 공화국의 정당한 계승자로서 인정받게 되었고, 망명 정부는 세계대전에서 같은 편에 섰던 국가들에게만 정통 정부로 인정받게 되었습니다. 그러나, 망명자들은 두려워하지 않았습니다. 그들은 자신들이 전 프랑스 본토와 식민 제국을 통치하는 정통정부임을, 그리고 협상국을 위해 계속 싸워 나갈 것을 천명했으며 본토를 공격하기 위한 준비를 계속해 나갔습니다.\n\n하지만, 망명의 여파는 국가를 매우 불안정하게 만들었습니다. 민주주의 세력들은 단결된 정부를 형성하는데 계속 실패하였고, 사소한 갈등들이 이어졌으며 설상가상으로 망명자들과 피에 누아르 이주민들 사이의 긴장 역시 상황을 더욱 악화시켰습니다. 이러한 상황에서 1926년, 군이 개입하여 비상사태를 선포하였고 베르됭의 사자, 필리프 페탱이 그의 제자 프랑수아 다를랑 제독이나 앙리 모르닥 장군과 같은 세계대전 영웅들의 지원을 받아 이끄는 군정이 들어섰습니다. 프랑스군 최고 사령관으로서 국가를 확고하게 통제하는 페탱은 분명 프랑스를 완벽하게 장악하고 있지만, 헌법은 개정되거나 무효화되지 않았으며, 의회는 원수와 간부의 결정을 따르는 거수기로 전락했지만 동시에 공화국과 그 행정기관들은 철폐되지 않고 서류상에서나마 계속 이어져 왔습니다. 정당들 역시 여전히 존재하고 있으며 대중들에게 민주주의의 환상을 주기 위해 계속 활동하고 있지만 이들이 어떠한 권력이라도 가지고 있다고 생각하는 이상주의자들은 거의 없습니다. 공화국에서 활동하고 있는 네 개의 주요 정당은 각각 급진당(RAD), 민주공화당(PRD), 기존의 자유적-보수적 정당들이 망명 후 결성한 프랑스 사회당(PSF), 그리고 악시옹 프랑세즈(AF)입니다."
nfa.1.a:0 "저주받을 코뮌 놈들!"

nfa.2.t:0 "프랑스 공화국의 상황 - 정치적 상황"
nfa.2.d:0 "페탱 원수는 프랑스의 구원을 위해서는 권위주의적 통치가 필수적이라고 확신하고 있습니다. 그러나, 비록 제3공화국의 주요 정당으로서 패전과 혁명에 대한 책임을 질 수밖에 없기에 명성은 낮지만 급진당과 민주공화당은 여전히 대중적 지지를 받고 있으며, 전쟁 이후 참전 용사들에 의해 창당된 프랑스 사회당은 민주주의와 권위주의적 통제 사이의 길을 추구하며 활동하고 있습니다. 따라서, 정당 활동을 완전히 금지하는 것은 공화국에 감당하기 어려운 불안정성을 초래할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 아직 어떠한 민주 정당도 참전용사들에게 베르됭의 사자로 불리며, 군부가 프랑스가 인터내셔널에 맞설 수 있게 만들 수 있는 유일한 지도자로 여기는 페탱 원수에 맞설만한 힘을 가지지 못하고 있습니다. 그러나 균형을 추구하는 정권의 태도가 언제까지나 이어질 수는 없습니다. 민주주의를 추구하는 이들은 정권에 대한 신뢰를 점점 잃어가고 있고, 악시옹 프랑세즈의 군주주의자들은 프랑스의 구원이 공화국과 그 제도의 전복에 의해서만 가능하다고 믿고 있으며 이러한 사상은 군 내의 많은 이들과 전통적 프랑스인, 원주민 엘리트들 사이에서 조심스럽게 받아들여지고 있습니다. 간단히 말해서, 군정은 느리지만 확실히 정치적 신뢰를 잃어 가고 있으며 이제는 페탱의 명성에 의해 유지되고 있는 상황입니다."
nfa.2.a:0 "우리는 사자를 믿을 수 있다!"

nfa.3.t:0 "프랑스 공화국의 상황 - 커져가는 불안"
nfa.3.d:0 "마치 대중의 지지 부족만으로는 충분치 않았던 것처럼 정권의 근간인 군부 내부에서도 원수에 대한 신뢰가 점차 약화되기 시작했습니다. 페탱은 제자들을 편애해 그들을 여러 요직에 앉혀 놓았고, 그들이 확실히 유능하긴 하지만 이때문에 많은 장교들이 뒤쳐졌으며 또한 일부는 페탱이 예스맨들로 둘러싸인 것이 군사 교리의 부패를 초래하고 말 것이라고 걱정하고 있습니다. 그러나 원수의 측근 중 앙리 모르닥과 같은 이들이 현 상황에 대해 공개적인 비판을 가해 오고 있고, 많은 이들이 페탱이 개혁적 성향의 제자들의 의견을 언젠간 경청할 것이라고 믿고 있기에 아직까지 이러한 불만은 군 내부의 논쟁 선에서 제한되어 왔습니다. 그러나 한가지 분명한 사실은 이런 분열이 확대될 경우 정권에 재앙을 초래할 것이란 것입니다.\n\n그러나 공화국이 직면한 가장 큰 문제는 바로 국가가 망명 상태에 놓여 있다는 것입니다. 비록 알제리가 19세기 후반 공식적으로 해외 데파르트망으로서 프랑스에 합병되었고, 망명자들과 피에 누아르 정착민들이 인구의 상당 부분을 차지하고 일부 대도시에서는 대다수를 차지하기도 하지만, 아직까지 알제리 사회는 소수에 불과한 유럽인이 수백만에 달하는 원주민들을 지배하는 형태로 구성되어 있습니다. 원주민들은 프랑스인으로 취급되긴 하지만 본질적으로 2등 시민으로, 무거운 세금과 노역의 의무를 지고 있으며 지역 엘리트들과 군에 의해 강압적으로 이루어지는 알제의 통치를 받고 있습니다. 세계대전에서의 패전 이후 식민지의 상황은 불안정합니다. 소요사태는 무자비하게 진압되어 왔고, 최근의 기근 대처는 실패하였으며 생디칼리스트들과 범아랍주의 운동가들은 식민정부에 대항하는 선전을 펼치고 있습니다. 하지만, 대부분의 원주민 엘리트들은 여전히 프랑스에 충성하고 있으며, 개혁을 원하긴 하지만 여전히 정부에 충성하고자 하는 프랑스식 교육을 받은 원주민들과 원주민 참전용사들 역시 존재하고 있습니다. 그러나 한 가지는 분명합니다. 만약 정부가 부주의하게 행동한다면 더 많은 불안, 더 나아가 반란까지 초래할 수도 있습니다.\n\n§R조심하세요! 코어가 없는 아프리카 지역 주에서 저항도를 80 이하로 유지하는 데 실패한다면 반란이 일어날 것입니다.§!"

nfa.4.t:0 "Death of a Friend"
nfa.4.d:0 "His Majesty George V, by the Grace of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India, friend of France, our great ally during the Great War and since our exile, as well as a personal friend of Marshal Pétain since the two met on the battlefields two decades ago has died today at 70 years old. Though the situation is unfortunately tense at home, given the magnitude of the event it is important for the Entente that the Lion attends the funeral of George V and the coronation of his son Edward, and more personally for Pétain it is important to mourn a friend and ally, who like him oversaw the exile of his people after bloody revolutions in their homelands, and like him was wholeheartedly dedicated to one day come back and retake what is rightfully theirs. And so Marshal Pétain embarked on a special Trans-Atlantic flight, ready to honour the memory of a friend but celebrate a new era of Anglo-French friendship."
nfa.4.a:0 "The King is dead, long live the King!"

nfa.5.t:0 "The Lion in Canada"
nfa.5.d:0 "After a sixty-hour transatlantic flight, Marshal Pétain arrived in Ottawa, greeted by Prime Minister Mackenzie King and a large crowd of Canadians, mostly Québécois who see this state visit as a renewal of Anglo-French cooperation. They then drove to Windsor, where late King-Emperor George had asked to be buried. After a grandiose and emotional ceremony where Pétain was finally able to say farewell to a personal friend and ally, he took a tour of Ontario and Québec, greeted all along the way as a friend of the Empire, before meeting with King Edward VIII. In a pre-planned move, the two men shook hands in front of the media of the world, and the new king declared that no matter the struggles the future holds, the French and British nations would always fight side by side in this great crusade against the syndicalist threat. Later on, the two men held a private talk, discussing current issues facing the Entente, the policies that both men were planning on undertaking, as well as the inevitable prospect of war. The mutual undying commitment of both nations to each other was, of course, renewed, announcing even stronger bonds within the Entente."

nfa.6.t:0 "Disagreements within the Armée"
nfa.6.d:0 "After the Grande Guerre, two schools of thoughts have emerged among the younger superior officers to explain the military defeat. If both conclude that the defeat was primarily caused by inefficiency, personal feuds and a general lack of coordination within the military high command, wasting the bravery and blood of the French infantryman as well as the strategic and tactical innovations of Phillipe Pétain, they disagree on what caused those issues and most importantly on what should be done to correct them. Two men have emerged as the leaders of these factions within the French army, and both are planning to release books explaining their point of view. They have sent copies to the Marshal in hopes of getting some public support for their work over the opposition."
nfa.6.a:0 "Let's see what they wrote"

nfa.7.t:0 "The Bear or the Rooster?"
nfa.7.d:0 "Henri Mordacq, nicknamed “the Bear”, an infantry general who shot up the ranks during the Great War through sheer bravery and commanding ability, particularly in the desperate defence of Arras. Close to Pétain but a long time critic of the military establishment, he believes the war was lost due to the lack of experienced officers and an out of touch high command. He plans to release a book titled “Lessons of 1914 and the Next War”, detailing his experience of the war and his proposals for the coming war. Among those proposals, the retirement of all officers older than fifty-six years old and a merging of all branches of the armed forces could prove controversial, effectively reorganizing the Forces Armées from scratch.\n\nCharles de Gaulle, nicknamed “the Rooster”, recently promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. A fellow veteran of the Great War, he bravely led his men at the battle of Verdun before being wounded and captured. Escaping captivity, he became a symbol of resilience against German aggression. Particularly ambitious, he became a protégé of the Lion of Verdun and a renowned military theorist, making rather similar observations regarding the defeat as Mordacq but advocating for greater cooperation rather than reorganisation, a greater use of armour with air support, greater autonomy for officers, and creating alongside the traditional conscripted army a more important core of professional soldiers. These proposals have found a lot of support among officers, but de Gaulle is planning to release another essay, simply entitled “The Discord”. If this essay is simply presented as a collection of observations on the confusion reigning among officers during the War, to some it seem to endorse the stab-in-the-back theory popular among civilians, soldiers, and officers alike. Especially considering de Gaulle’s proposal to prevent confusion at critical times is submission of the military to “moral” civilian power.\n\nMarshal Pétain could choose to support the publication of either of those books, effectively setting the course of reforms within the armed forces, or simply let the debate run its course."

nfa.8.d:0 "Supported by Marshal Pétain, “Lessons of 1914 and the Next War” by General Henri Mordacq has become an instant best-seller among officers and the general public alike. After all, most are veterans. While upper ranking officers grumble about Mordacq’s proposal of a sweeping reorganization of the armed forces, all can see the acuteness of his analysis and enjoy the scathing denunciations of both Kaiser and Communards. The Bear's calls to action, to reform, to be able to stand ready to strike against the Red at the first opportunity, echo throughout the République. Many are starting to consider Mordacq a potential political leader, and his calls for reorganisation are being assimilated with a more general discontentment with the political structures of the nation."

While it is nothing new to those that lived through it, many in the general public, particularly the younger generation, too young to have fought in the Grande Guerre, discover dumbfounded this uncomfortable truth: the defeat was by our own doing more than anything else. While the tactical and strategic reforms proposed in this essay by de Gaulle have been acclaimed by officers, it is the larger societal reform some see the Rooster hint at in his work that struck a chord for many in the armed forces, from the simple infantryman to the Lion of Verdun himself, and among civilians, particularly veterans: all those sacrifices, so much bloodshed, so many lives lost, how could they have not been enough to beat back the Boches? The issue must lie primarily elsewhere, in the government, too weak to impose its will upon the armed forces and far too willing to let them fall into fatal discord. Perhaps a stronger, more moral civilian power is needed.\n\nIn any case, de Gaulle, already a celebrated war hero and influential officer, is quickly becoming an even more popular figure, as many of those touched by his call to reform feel he is the perfect example a new generation of officers must aspire to be like, while some see in him the perfect man to help carry out those larger reforms, though the lieutenant-colonel himself is quick to defer any praise towards his “mentor”, Philippe Pétain."

While both essays have been highly praised by critics and the general public alike, their simultaneous publication has prompted comparisons between the two works and become the number one topic of discussion in cafés, family dinners and officer lounges alike. Debates sometimes get heated as they drift from literary to political questions, as people wonder aloud about the implications of the proposed reforms of the two officers, some are starting to see both the Bear and the Rooster as potential political leaders."

While only injuries and property damages have been reported, evidently this literary debate has crystallized much deeper issues in our nation and media, officers, and regular citizens alike feel compelled to choose a side. Marshal Pétain has privately asked the Bear and the Rooster to make a joint statement calling for peaceful debate, as both men grow ever more influential."

Now that he is gone, the Marshal will have to choose who will serve as his replacement. His two protégés, both war heroes and up and coming officers, Charles de Gaulle or Henri Mordacq, are expected to be chosen to ascend to these highest of responsibilities. Such a promotion will be seen by many as appointing a successor for the Lion of Verdun, now an old man. Should Mordacq be appointed, it is likely that he would be seen as Pétain’s successor, and the move would be perceived as a clear endorsement of Mordacq’s plans for sweeping military and political reform. Picking de Gaulle, a much younger man, closer to Pétain and a known sympathiser of the Marshal’s unabashed distrust of parliamentarianism, would certainly be perceived as a way to hold on to power for some more time while better preparing his eventual heir to succeed him.\n\nAlternatively, Pétain could simply not appoint a successor to Franchet d’Espèrey, guaranteeing that the hero of Verdun would once again take an active interest in military matters, and centralise power around himself."

However, those less enthusiastic about The Discord, particularly those anxious of what a more “moral” civilian order might entail, have found in Mordacq an alternative and see in the general a potential political leader, someone to go against the grain of the stab-in-the-back fever currently sweeping through the nation."

Though this retirement has been carefully prepared by the Lion, and no one in either the government or the administration is surprised by this decision, for the people this is the sudden end of an era. Though some are openly rejoicing, most are simply stunned: after all the younger among them have never known a different political situation and for those old enough to remember the mainland the Marshal has been the centre of political life for more than a decade. To prevent any kind of panic and alleviate fears for the future, the hero of Verdun then decided to give a speech in front of the assembled Senate and National Assembly, broadcast on the radio: citing his old age as the primary reason for his retirement, the surprisingly cheerful Pétain then proceeded to thank all those that supported him in the troubled times since the Grande Guerre, in particular veterans, making less than subtle references to the Bear of Arras, Henri Mordacq, though never naming him.\n\nHis closing statement calling for a peaceful transition of power and reaffirming his full trust in the people to continue the fight to retake the métropole, Marshal Pétain ended his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from his iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, immediately followed by thunderous applause and a long-standing ovation. As the applause died down, a voice resonated: “Maréchal, merci !”, “Marshal, thank you!”, a breach of protocol that all in the room immediately happily imitated. Outside the building, the population had spontaneously come together to say goodbye to the saviour of France, regardless of class and status, exiled, pied-noirs and Algerians, and all repeated this cry, thanking Philippe Pétain as he was leaving on foot, as all the frustrations, all the anger of the past few weeks and years at least momentarily disappeared."

As such, as Marshal Pétain seeks increased support from diverse powerful groups in his struggle with Mordacq’s partisans, he has found particular luck with the industrial upper classes, both grateful for the support that gave them the opportunity to strive after exile and deeply ideologically committed to the regime, believing a strong hand is needed to guide France towards salvation. However, to prevent these elites from being tempted by the more democratic forces within the République, many of Pétain’s advisors are suggesting a campaign of increased support and strategic investments: not only would this develop the nation’s economy and war capabilities even further, but by choosing carefully those who would benefit from these investments, for example both loyal supporters of the regime and those still tempted by Mordacq's rhetoric, the Lion’s grip on power could be restored, maybe even increased."

The Marshal, either unwilling or unable to take any radical action to protect his regime had stayed oddly silent, holed up in the presidential Summer Palace in the heights of Algiers as unrest flared up all around him, his support among both the people and the elites he had tried so hard to rally quickly withering. All could see the writing on the wall, his rule could not last much longer, there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to sell out the country to hold on to power, was left.\n\nToday, what all were expecting finally happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of protests instead seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarters of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. In a short radio speech, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relating to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offense, ending his speech with a long list of the shady dealings revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with tense applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial."

Appearing in court in full uniform, after a short statement on the first day of his trial asserting that all of his actions as president had been taken in the interest of the salvation of France and that he was only responsible in front of the French people and not the High Court, the former president stayed silent as witnesses after witnesses corroborated the accusations lobbied against him. After weeks of passionate debate, the sentence has finally been given: death. At this verdict, the Marshal who had stayed so stoic briefly showed weakness, lost his composure, briefly the Lion of Verdun turned into Philippe Pétain, a tired old man of more than 80 years of age.\n\nPublic opinion is incredibly divided, but it seems that if most wanted the Marshal gone from power, the majority thinks any sentence would be going too far, let alone the death penalty. Wanting to avoid making this trial too overtly partisan, Henri Mordacq has thus far stayed silent, however as president it his within his power to commute Pétain’s sentence.

Nevertheless, their support and expertise has proved invaluable for the regime and Pétain has met repeatedly with representatives from the organization, taking some of its members as special advisors to help him navigate the crisis currently unfolding and the ideas of the Redressement Français will no doubt have a tremendous amount of influence in the decisions taken by the Marshal going forward."

Marshal Pétain’s gamble to hold on power has paid off: with the Redressement Français’ precious help, he has managed to thoroughly secure the support of the upper classes, rekindle the admiration of the people, and calm down social unrest. The democratic camp still exists, but it has been severely weakened by media attacks and backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans, its support base greatly eroded by the government’s promises of reform. It’s rumoured that Mordacq himself has struck a deal with the government. Many thought this would be the end of his regime, and yet Philippe Pétain emerges from this crisis stronger than ever: The Bear’s faction is no longer a threat, and the people once again has put its trust in the Lion of Verdun. While the Marshal has had a strong grip on politics since the revolution, it seems that now nothing can stop him from truly reforming the republic according to his wishes.\n\nOr, some whisper, according to the Redressement Français’ wishes. Its help proved decisive: on an ideological level, as many of the reforms proposed by Pétain are lifted straight from their ideas, and on the material level, the Renewal having turned itself into the propaganda arm of the government during the crisis, funding and organising its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime’s stabilisation came in large part thanks to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think tank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and, more importantly, with Pétain’s trust and gratitude. They will no doubt have a large influence shaping the future of the République, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group’s writings. In any case, now that the crisis is over the entire nation’s attention is turned towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. The people now fully united behind Marshal Pétain, finally free from petty divisions, is ready to save the Patrie."

Darlan, De Gaulle, all hoped to find a plan to stay in power and avoid the fall of the Marshal. Only Lelong was missing from the call, he had just managed to take a taxi to his appointment.\n\nIn the car, he held his briefcase tightly like a soldier holding his gun as all the steps of Mordacq's plan were played out in his head. Everything had been carefully studied, the plans of the building had been analysed to ensure that the General could leave him alive, but he knew that there was no such thing as zero risk. He took a picture of himself with his wife and children out of his pocket, and put it back in his pocket a few seconds later, praying that the driver would not have seen anything.\nOnce he arrived in front of the HQ, Lelong got out of the vehicle, head held high, well aware that he could no longer reverse...\n\nArriving late in front of the building, he apologized to the officers who were guarding him, then went to join the meeting. After greetings and a series of apologies and explanations for his delay, he went to sit down and listened to the various proposals, having taken care to settle as close as possible to Pétain. The discussions and debates followed, then he pretended the need to go to the bathroom to get up and leave the room, leaving his briefcase behind him. Weygand intercepted him before he came out and asked him what he had brought with him."Confidential documents that were successfully stolen from Mordacq, we even found a plan to assassinate Pétain.

The alarm was triggered and panic soon spread throughout the HQ. Through all the sounds of broken windows and overturned chairs, he could hear a voice screaming, "He's not dead! He's not dead! He's not dead!  Call a doctor," and immediately recognized Charles De Gaulle's voice. As adrenaline flowed through his body, he ran to the meeting room, picking up a fallen soldier's rifle as he passed by one of the doors that had previously been guarded before the explosion. The door fell with a simple touch, and Lelong saw Pétain covered with blood but with wide open eyes and at his side de Gaulle. Panicked and determined to complete the mission, Lelong fired two bullets into the Marshal's chest, and a third went to lodge in the General's head beside him. Both collapsed to the ground, covered in blood. Lelong then threw his weapon away, and ran back to the toilet before speeding out through the window overlooking the back of the building. He then reached the door at the back, which was no longer guarded because the soldiers had been called inside.

This special congress assembled late in the night, no name was proposed other than that of General Henri Mordacq, elected with a vast majority of votes, an eagerness possibly helped by the presence of soldiers loyal to the Bear guarding all exits of the room. Coincidentally present in the building, General Mordacq immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, promising new elections in the near future and eventually a new constitution. Despite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters hope for radical reform and a more democratic future.

Knowing full well resisting arrest would only be inviting the regime to put him down on the spot, the Bear went peacefully. Immediately transferred to a secret location near Algiers, news of his arrest was triumphantly spread by the government to the media, feeding them a colorful story of the fool Mordacq conspiring with Communards agents to take down the Pétain government and invite the Reds in. While it’s undeniable that some supporters of Mordacq had ties to the more left wing pre-war parties and some of those arrested have confessed under strong interrogation techniques to being on the Commune’s payroll, the evidence of such collusion is light at best. Despite being offered a generous deal in exchange of his confession, Mordacq himself so far refuses to admit doing anything wrong. Surprisingly, many are openly doubting the official story. Arresting such a popular war hero is not going well even among strong supporters of the regime, particularly veterans who remember very well the heroic defense of Arras, and even within the army many who would have been at worst apathetic with repressing the democratic movement are now outraged that the government would go so far.\n\nIn any case, what Pétain feared happened: Henri Mordacq is now a martyr. Open contestation from the army is unprecedented, and many within the government are starting to panic and advise a balanced approach: doubling down on the repression, going after those now protesting against Mordacq’s arrest, while at the same time pulling back somewhat, transfer Mordacq out of hiding, and give him a public trial."

Wanting to stay discreet, the escort had been kept to a minimum and was swiftly dealt with, those attempting to resist shot dead, Mordacq escorted to a car and the convoy set on fire all in the span of less than five minutes. Survivors of the attack describe the prisoner as being just as surprised as his escort that this was happening, but clearly someone coordinated this attack from the inside: not only was this transfer supposed to be a secret to even most of the government, but a fake itinerary had been disseminated by intelligence agents and a decoy convoy had been organised. Whoever leaked the information must have been either very well connected, or is very high up in the chain of command. An investigation has of course been launched and all police are on high alert, but while the violence of Mordacq’s partisans has earned the regime some sympathy, this spectacular evasion has thrown the government in total panic: not only this shows to the eyes of the world that the regime is losing control, but it shows our people that the democratic movement has very influential friends. In any case, the few advisers still advocating for moderation when dealing with the democratic camp have been thoroughly disgraced with some even under heavy suspicion of being Mordacq sympathizers and those advocating for harsher repression now have the Marshal’s ear."

When political pressure and intimidation do not work, blackmail and social shaming generally did the trick. However, this treatment was reserved for civilians, as the government and intelligence services were careful to preserve the reputation of the armed forces, dissenters generally being simply sent on assignment in the middle of the Sahara where their concerns wouldn’t bother anyone. However, with Mordacq’s arrest shocking many, it’s been decided that the large amount of information collected over the years by the intelligence services on soldiers and officers alike would be put to good use. The latest victim of such attempted blackmail is admiral Lucien Lacaze, a known supporter of Mordacq and well liked, successful, and above all morally irreproachable officer. The man has refused to back down when approached by our agents, and denies any of the accusations lobbied against him.\n\nAs such, these shocking revelations will appear in an afternoon special edition in all newspapers. In fact, mysteriously, all those who have publicly stated their support for Mordacq seem to have been cursed to have their most private secrets revealed, which could of course severely hinder their careers and might just spurn them to resign in disgrace."

Admiral Lacaze has been made into a new martyr for the democratic camp, and though he retired in the wake of the scandal, it seems he is now in direct contact with Mordacq's partisans. Although this drastically hinders our plans to deal with dissent among the armed forces with some subtlety, there are far more worrying things: not only we have lost whatever trust officers still put in the regime, but the leaflets currently spreading like wildfire contain confidential documents concerning the fabrication of the various scandals, implicating in this defamation campaign high ranking officers as well many within the administration and in the government.

While our forces were supposed to suppress any protest, many police and military officers are confused by this unusual situation and decided to simply stand aside to avoid fighting their comrades and friends. Many civilians are watching this protest out of curiosity, and it is now obvious for everyone that Pétain’s rule is far from being popular even within the armed forces, traditionally the one place where the regime was most secure. Since protests are banned for active duty soldiers, the official version of events is that those officers are simply “parading”, a term that most opposition journals, underground or miraculously still being openly published, are now using ironically to designate these protests. The “Parades” have been going on for days now, and it is time we choose how to deal with the situation.

In any case, the number of protesters is increasing each day, and our forces still refuse to take any active action against them, at best barring access to the way to the presidential palace and other important government buildings, with discrete but numerous gestures of solidarity between the two.

All were expecting the Marshal to strike, many were ready to die in the streets, and yet, Pétain did nothing. If this was done hoping the people would calm down, it was foolish as there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to brutalise his people to hold on to power was left."

Even if Pétain had tried to strike, this was in fact doomed from the start: most the 2nd Bureau, the secret services, was compromised and cooperating with the Bear’s partisans, the “leaks” were entirely purposeful. In a short radio speech, the first since his arrest and subsequent escape, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq and freshly freed from jail, rose to deliver an improvised speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his tyrannical regime, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the suspended Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offense, ending his speech with a long list of the numerous grievous crimes revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with thunderous applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still foolishly loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial, held in the same high security cell that had been prepared for Henri Mordacq."

While there is no constitutional provision for the creation of such a committee, there is historical precedent, and the Chamber of Deputies is, after all, the sovereign authority in the Republic and can distribute power as it sees fit. While some deputies abstained, the majority voted in favor of the proposal and no name other than that of General Henri Mordacq, hero of the struggle against the tyrannical Pétain, was proposed to head the committee, an eagerness possibly helped by the presence of soldiers loyal to the Bear guarding all exits of the room. Present in the building, the General immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, new elections once the situation stabilizes and eventually the redaction of a new constitution.\n\nDespite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters are finally able to show themselves after months of repression.

Veterans are shocked by the actions of the man they have revered for so long, and La Grande Muette is making herself heard loud and clear: she is outraged by the government’s repression. The government desperately needs allies, and it seems at least one group inpart might be interested in such a partnership: the royalist Action Française. Indeed, today Charles de Gaulle came to discuss privately with Marshal Pétain about a potential alliance of circumstances. The Rooster seems to have taken upon himself to act as link between his mentor and the party he has never hidden sympathies for and though the national integralists have been consistently and brazenly opposed to the République, considering Pétain’s regime as barely a step up from the weak pre-war government, they share a common trait: distrust for parliamentary democracy and the liberal parties whose rule led to the fall of France in the first place.\n\nAs such, the Action Française is suggesting unofficial cooperation with the regime, at least until the crisis is over, a partnership that could prove salutatory for the Lion and his government. As an old, very well established party the French Action has many sympathizers among both the upper and lower classes, within the Church, the army and even enjoys some popularity with the native population, drawn in by promises of decentralisation and respect of local customs. Its daily newspaper is among the most widely read in the nation, and the party controls a network of “newspaper vendors”, the Camelots du Roi, the King's Camelots, a security service made up of youngsters and students that some describe as a paramilitary force, used to street brawls and crowd control. Finally, some of the more radical members of the AF have hinted at being willing to use every tool at their disposal to take more “direct action” against the democratic camp. All of this could be used to serve the regime and finally end the crisis once and for all.\n\nHowever this partnership could alienate the last few loyal partisans of Pétain, and there is no doubt that the services of the AF would come at the cost of compromise with them down the road.

It would seem like the regime can breathe a great sigh of relief, as Mordacq's movement is now far less ascendant.\n\nHowever, part of the loss of ground for the democratic camp is the due to brutal tactics of the more radical elements of the French Action, who have organised themselves in a highly structured, secretive and independent group to take direct action against the Bear’s supporters, with little to no oversight by the party and none from the government. Intimidation, assassination, and even bombings, in the last few weeks it seems nothing is too far for them to take down the democratic camp.

What had started as a rather absurd display of anger by the Grande Muette was now a daily tense standoff from sunrise to sundown, with occasional brawls between protesters and camelots. Miraculously, despite the numerous injuries sustained in the daily brawls, no deaths had occurred at the parades.\n\nThat is, until today. As one of the usual fights broke out between protesters and camelots, a shot rang out, followed by a cry of pain. No one knows who fired it or where it came from, but after a split second of shocked silence, there was chaos. More and more gunshots came from each side, and with each one protesters, camelots, police and military fell to the ground, some wounded, some dead. Initially overwhelmed, the regime forces quickly regained their composure, the sight of their dead comrades shedding any feelings of hesitation they might have had towards fighting against fellow soldiers. Things quickly turned to street to street fighting, with barricades being hastily constructed by protesters engaging in what could only be described as a fighting retreat: most of them being active duty soldiers or veterans, there was certainly confusion, but no panic. Though they have been pushed back to the littoral, the protesters remain in firm control of much of center of Algiers as the government forces await further orders."

Deeply shocked by the events unfolding, Marshal Pétain had dismissed all proposals from the military, the police, ministers, advisers, even his protégé Charles de Gaulle, considering them all as risking too many lives. Talks with the protesters had gone nowhere, and the lack of central leadership among them would make any consensus impossible anyway. A tense silence had fallen on the conference room in the presidential palace, broken only by the sound of the occasional gunshots. Then, news came: the protesters has seized heavy machine guns, and chosen to fall back further and fortify a large plaza where a field hospital had been set up. Any assault would be extremely costly, and everyone in the room knew it. And then, quietly, almost a whisper:\n\n“...shell them”.\n\nA young navy officer had broken the silence. He continued: “We could shell them. The Liberté class dreadnought Démocratie is anchored a few miles from Algiers, if we wait until nightfall and order her to shell the plaza, it would create enough confusion to storm the camp while minimising damage to the city and losses for our forces. They’re expecting an assault from land, certainly not from the sea”. After a few seconds of silence, the Lion of Verdun angrily stood up, but before he could speak Charles de Gaulle, the Rooster, intervened: “I’m afraid we have no choice here. If we let the situation fester, we could wake up tomorrow morning to a general insurrection: we must nip this revolution in the bud and act fast. I’m sorry Marshal but now is the time of action, not debate.”.\n\nAnd so, as Philippe Pétain fell silent, the order was given."

The proposed strategy was indeed incredibly effective, and as soon as the first shells hit the protesters abandoned any kind of organised defense and fled in all directions only to run into our forces assaulting the plaza, where they either immediately surrendered or were promptly dealt with. Tales of mangled bodies, of brutal treatment of prisoners, of summary executions are being spread by communard agents, but our nation knows the truth: the next morning, the front page of all newspapers read: “Attempted Coup Bravely Defeated”. The threat posed by these red traitors has finally been dealt with: the few remaining so-called democrats are now either in custody, awaiting trial for their crimes, in hiding, though they will be found sooner or later, or they lie dead in a mass grave slowly filling up as the plaza is being cleaned up. Henri Mordacq, or what was left of his body, was found and identified by his uniform: the Bear himself is dead and we can now breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nMarshal Pétain is however deeply affected by what happened and has not left the presidential palace since, refusing to see anyone other than his wife and his confessor, only occasionally wandering outside of his quarters, mumbling to himself. As such, Charles de Gaulle has unofficially stepped in to help run governmental affairs for the time being: after all, who better than the Lion’s protégé to make sure things go smoothly in these critical times? Having been promoted to the rank of general for his bravery and skill dealing with the crisis, France’s stability is now the utmost priority of the Rooster, and as such he has launched a new large scale investigation to find and bring to justice any and all of those who might have been involved in this attempted coup. Much remains to be done, but all those who would dare endanger the patrie in these critical times are now warned: no longer will their traitorous behavior be tolerated."

Though we could have feared instability after the Marshal’s temporary condition had been made public, de Gaulle’s energetic guidance, his status as a respected war hero, as protégé of Pétain, and his own personal prestige alleviated the fears of many. The sheer scale of the corruption has been dutifully reported by the media, and each day a new arrest, a new scandal shocks our people, who finally, truly understand this truth: just as the Rooster had described it in La Discorde, the worst threat facing us does not come from outside our borders, but from within. The defeats, the struggles, the sacrifices now all make sense: our efforts had been sabotaged, wasted by inside forces.\n\nHowever our efforts to finally once and for all deal with the parasites plaguing the patrie are still being restricted by petty liberal concerns, and de Gaulle realises that extraordinary measures must be taken to ensure the salvation of France. As such he has come to Philippe Pétain with a proposal: for the Lion of Verdun to resign as president of the French Republic to enjoy a glorious retirement and be able to care for his clearly ailing health, and for a motion to be presented in front of the National Assembly granting the government full powers to create and promulgate a new constitution, better suited to defend national interests.

His closing statement calling for peaceful transition of power and reaffirming his full trust in de Gaulle to guide the nation in these troubled times and in the people to continue the fight to retake the métropole, Marshal Pétain ended his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from his iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: “Courage, on les aura !”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, immediately followed by thunderous applause and a long standing ovation. As the applause died down, a voice resonated: “Maréchal, merci!”, “Marshal, thank you!”, a breach of protocol that all in the room immediately happily imitated. Outside the building, the population had spontaneously come together to say goodbye to the savior of France, regardless of class and status, thanking Philippe Pétain as he was leaving on foot, as all the anger, all the fears of the past few weeks and years at least momentarily disappeared. Pétain himself, usually so stoic, looked emotional and strangely enough, relieved.\n\nAfter a short break, a député, known supporter of the Action Française, rose to deliver a clearly well rehearsed speech detailing the extent of the corruption recently unveiled and reminding his fellow congressmen of the orgy of violence that engulfed the nation, finally calling for extraordinary powers to be given to the de Gaulle government to be able to truly reform the patrie.

Though an investigation will surely help us understand the true circumstances of the assassination, the killer was identified as a young journalist who had been suspected of links to Mordacq’s seditious faction and arrested but released due to lack of evidence.\n\nGeneral de Gaulle rushed to make a short but clearly emotional speech in front of the National Assembly broadcast on radio, calling for calm and order and solemnly vowing to bring those responsible for this atrocious act to justice, ending his speech with this simple phrase, quoted from Pétain’s iconic order so many years ago at Verdun: “Courage, on les aura!”, “Be strong, we’ll get ‘em!”, immediately followed by thunderous applause.

Everywhere the enemies of France still lurked, and Charles de Gaulle, finally given the tools to save France, continued the work already started to cleanse the nation. Everywhere he looked, more and more evidence of the incredibly deep rot affecting the République came to light. Tasked with saving France, the general had come to a simple conclusion, that today he exposed in a speech in front of the Senate.\n\n“Trusted with the arduous task of guiding the nation in these hazardous times, I must put the patrie above all. Above my personal feelings, above petty convictions, above divisions. As such, I have come to the conclusion that a system born in the fires of revolution cannot extinguish the fire of another, and that any constitution my government could put together couldn’t be enough to ensure the safety and future of our nation. As such, as chief of state of the French Republic, with the powers granted to me by the people, I hereby declare that to ensure the salvation of France we should look towards the fundamental laws, the laws that governed our nation and made her glory since times immemorial, the laws of the kingdom. As such, for the good of France and her people, as a subject, I hereby humbly ask monseigneur the Duke de Guise, heir of forty kings who over a millennia made France, to seize the crown and guide us towards the resurrection, the renewal of France.”\n\nTruth is, no one was surprised by this speech. Neither the parliamentarians, nor the people. General de Gaulle’s sympathies for the monarchy and the royalist Action Française were no secret, and forces loyal to the regime and the AF, in the media, the Church, the armed forces, had worked tirelessly to cement the idea of restoration in the public consciousness. The defeat and the revolution had already severely damaged the image of the République, recent events made sure few were still truly attached to her. The senators gave de Gaulle a long standing ovation, named him lieutenant-general of the reborn kingdom, regent in other words, before voting to dissolve the legislative chambers.

Some are fleeing, others hope the collective wrath will simply pass, though it is quickly becoming uncontrollable. The political disagreements of yesterday have turned into blind rage and some are even taking advantages of the general frenzy to settle personal feuds, either joining the mob and influencing it into going after personal enemies, or denouncing as liberals, as Mordacq-sympathiser, as republicans whoever slighted them.

Furthermore, the call for deep reform by the new head of state is seen by many civilians as a prelude to the restoration of democratic life, though Mordacq has so far not challenged the state of emergency that has held France in democratic limbo for the last decade. The simmering hope has reached the ranks of the military, among which many already anxious at the prospect of the military reforms are at best sceptical of an eventual return to parliamentary democracy as war looms ever closer. A worry that their fellow reactionary officers have been quick to exploit, convincing some former Pétain loyalists that Mordacq was a poor choice over the much more conservative de Gaulle.\n\nIn any case, this barrack gossip is unlikely to have deeper consequences, Mordacq is a respected theorist and war hero, and the appointed successor of the Lion of Verdun.

Each and every one of them listened intently to the man who so recently still dominated the life of the nation, from the humblest of infantrymen to the most decorated officers present. They all heard loud and clear the message the Marshal was methodically laying out. Taking the tone of a disappointed grandfather, he compared the current situation of France to a lengthy trek across the hostile desert, where every resource is precious but the most important thing is cohesion within the group, for men to trust and rely on each other so that they may reach their destination. He strongly praised his successor and reaffirmed his trust in Mordacq’s ability and deeply reform the nation and her armed forces, before announcing that he would fully retire from public life, an announcement that ushered a wave of shock and whispers across the room.

As such, the various parties still exist, with a presidential coalition and an opposition publicly debating, though no one in the République is foolish enough to believe they hold any kind of real power. However, emboldened by the election of Henri Mordacq that they perceive as a friend to the cause of democracy, the long slumbering political parties have finally awakened. Though they would never dare publicly denounce the regime that they have dutifully supported since the exile, representatives from the main parties asked for a discrete private meeting with the Bear.\n\nThere, they explained their concerns to General Mordacq. While some among them spoke of the ideals of the Republic, of the moral duty to restore democracy, most had reached a much more practical conclusion: the people are losing trust in the regime, and its future seems bleak. For now, the popular hope for reform has focused around Mordacq. Despite his calls for deep reform, he remains largely politically aligned with the Pétain regime, with the same unflinching aim: retaking the métropole and taking down the Reds. As such, these deputies have proposed simply giving in to popular demands, declaring the state of emergency over, restoring the constitutional laws for the good of the stability of the republic, and calling for new elections, allowing a semblance of normal democratic life to flourish once again in the Republic.\n\nThe General was not unmoved by such arguments but has refused to give a straight answer regarding his intentions."

And yet, this radio intervention had the opposite effect: PSF members, as well as untold numbers of civilians, flooded the streets, to the stunned surprise of the units deployed, some more isolated groups of soldiers even getting scorned like children by the mod, before being peacefully disarmed and arrested. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of the Action Française, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of General Mordacq and his new government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the supposed crimes the Bear had supposedly committed and a call for an immediate vote. This was met with applause by some reactionary members of parliaments, who were immediately shouted down by the rest of the Assembly. Soldiers attempted to restore order but were unsuccessful.\n\nMinutes after this, troops loyal to the regime surrounded the Assembly and forced entry into the building.

While he still discusses policies with politicians from all sides and has frequent contacts with industrialists, they are mere advisors and Mordacq will keep the final say in all decisions taken.\n\nHowever, the threat caused by the Action Française is still very present, and we need to do something about it. Despite the support of the Second Bureau, their numbers are limited, and they will need time to infiltrate the Action Française. Time is running short, and our room for manoeuvre is shrinking. However, we do have one last option: asking once again Marshal for his help, though it is uncertain whether or not he will accept."

nfa.100.d:0 "Pétain and Mordacq, two men who deeply respect each other despite their differences. The meeting took place in the presidential palace overlooking Algiers. The Marshal confirmed the threat of a coup: he had already been contacted by his former supporters to lead it, but he had so far refused. Retirement had clearly not blunted the shrewdness of the Lion, for he had an offer for the Bear: both were aware that the days of the regime in its current form were numbered, whether the threat would come from royalists toppling the Republic or too much cooperation with democrats paralysing the state was the only question. As such, Marshal Pétain would once again offer his help to Mordacq, contact former loyalists lost to the AF, as well privately endorse the regime in social occasions with the rich and powerful as much as needed. In exchange, however, his successor would have to agree to not restore parliamentary democracy immediately, and to only do so only once France was whole once again, and stable: too much was at stake to leave politicians in charge.\n\nThe General, sharing his scepticism towards parliament, immediately agreed."

nfa.101.d:0 "Today, what all were expecting finally happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units seized strategic points in Algiers, as well as the Palace of Government, headquarter of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. In a short radio speech, de Gaulle attempted to call for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace to preserve the stability of the regime. And yet, this radio intervention had the opposite effect: untold numbers of civilians flooded the streets, to the stunned surprise of the units deployed, some more isolated groups of soldiers even getting scorned like children by the mod, before being peacefully disarmed and arrested. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of the Action Française, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of General Mordacq and his new government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the supposed crimes the Bear had supposedly committed and a call for an immediate vote. This was met with applause by some reactionary members of parliaments, who were immediately shouted down by the rest of the Assembly. Soldiers attempted to restore order but were unsuccessful.\n\nMinutes after this, troops loyal to the regime surrounded the Assembly and forced entry into the building. There they found de Gaulle, who remained silent as he was served a warrant for high treason. The Rooster did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial: clearly, the attempted coup did not go as planned."

While there is no constitutional provision for the creation of such a committee, there is historical precedent, and the Chamber of Deputies is, after all, the sovereign authority in the Republic and can distribute power as it sees fit. While some deputies abstained, the majority voted in favour of the proposal. Present in the building, the General immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on the radio promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, new elections once the situation stabilizes and eventually the redaction of a new constitution.\n\nWhether such a committee will be able to lead France effectively remains to be seen, but immediately celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities: indeed, it seems many had long hoped for radical reform and a more democratic future and our people trust Mordacq to lead the way. Despite the royalists’ best efforts, a new dawn is rising in the French Republic and the promised reforms will only strengthen the country for the war that is inevitably coming."

A decision perhaps helped along by the presence of armed men in the hemicycle, who immediately arrested those who had voted against the motion.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen and civilians loyal to the Bear of Arras. There they found Jean-Jules Henri Mordacq, in full uniform, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute and he was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial."

Coincidentally present in the building, he immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on the radio promising to restore order and purify France from the Communard threat.

By this simple motion, adopted unanimously, the destiny of France has changed for the better. Everywhere the enemies of France still lurked, and Charles de Gaulle, finally given the tools to save France, continued the work already started to cleanse the nation. Everywhere he looked, more and more evidence of the incredibly deep rot affecting the République came to light. Tasked with saving France, the General had come to a simple conclusion, that today he exposed in a speech in front of the Senate:\n\n\"Trusted with the arduous task of guiding the nation in these hazardous times, I must put the patrie above all. Above my personal feelings, above petty convictions, above divisions. As such, I have come to the conclusion that a system born in the fires of revolution cannot extinguish the fire of another, and that any constitution my government could put together couldn’t be enough to ensure the safety and future of our nation. As such, as chief of state of the French Republic, with the powers granted to me by the people, I hereby declare that to ensure the salvation of France we should look towards the fundamental laws, the laws that governed our nation and made her glory since times immemorial, the laws of the kingdom. As such, for the good of France and her people, as a subject, I hereby humbly ask monseigneur the Duke de Guise, heir of forty kings who over a millennia made France, to seize the crown and guide us towards the resurrection, the renewal of France.\"\n\nTruth is, no one was surprised by this speech. Neither the parliamentarians nor the people. General de Gaulle’s sympathies for the monarchy and the royalist Action Française were no secret, and forces loyal to the regime and the AF, in the media, the Church, the armed forces, had worked tirelessly to cement the idea of restoration in the public consciousness. The defeat and the revolution had already severely damaged the image of the République, recent events made sure few were still truly attached to her. The senators gave de Gaulle a long-standing ovation, named him Lieutenant-General of the reborn kingdom, regent in other words, before voting to dissolve the legislative chambers. The République has died a violent death, but few will mourn her."

The conclusion of the Second Weltkrieg marked the end of the third Franco-German war in the last 80 years. Many saw the conference in Lyon as just another bundle of kindling to spark further hatred between the two nations, but they have been proven wrong. With the signing of the treaty, the new French government is recognized as the true successor to the government that was toppled during the French civil war following the first Weltkrieg. The Germans have agreed to pull out of much of occupied France and return the land to the rightful government of France."

nfa.179.t:0 "The Question of Montmartre"
nfa.179.d:0 "Paris, the most beautiful city on Earth, has been freed from the grasps of the Communard. Under their rule, she had often been martyrized, defaced by radical avant-garde architecture and urban planning. Many buildings had been damaged during the revolution, and now the war has brought more destruction: as such, plans for the restoration of the City of Lights to her pre-revolutionary beauty have already been hastily thrown together as we discover the damage for the first time. However, one question remains: what should be done with Montmartre? The hill, towering above Paris, has a rich history: starting point of the 1871 Commune, later on a romantic village within the city and most importantly where an immense neo-byzantine basilica, the Sacré-Cœur, was being built, funded by donations from all over France. Close to completion when the revolution broke out, the basilica was never consecrated and was the site of a last hold out of loyalist forces. Damaged by the fighting, the building was gleefully torn down by the Communards, who saw it as a reactionary symbol as it was built to expiate the crimes of the original Commune of Paris. In its stead they built a modernist Palace of the People, where their attempt at government met.\n\nWe have received multiple proposals for the future of Montmartre, what should be done?"

Many of them had served in the French armed forces, joining the mutineers out of conviction or self-interest, others were foreigners who sought to serve the cause of the revolution. Many are present, stoic, or dazed, or crying hysterically. Some are still in hiding, some fled, and will have to be condemned in absentia. Each case is carefully examined by a court of officers, the defendant is charged with treason, mutiny, desertion, conspiracy against France, sometimes other accusations, and the verdict falls, inevitably: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.\n\nOne question remains, how to sentence the guilty. The typical sentence for military traitors is death by firing squad, however, even among our own military, there are calls for leniency on some of these officers, as they had contacted our intelligence services during or even before the war hoping to switch sides, arguing they had simply been thrust into serving a cause they did not believe in. Others argue that conflicts in the future are likely and that France cannot sacrifice talented officers."

These men and women are all facing a litany of accusations: treason, sedition, conspiracy against France, corruption... enumerated by the prosecutor, resonating in the high halls, the numerous audience inside and outside the courthouse staying deathly silent, the building surrounded by military forces to prevent any risk of last-ditch effort to rescue these traitors. Their names sound familiar to our people keenly informed these last few years of their numerous crimes against France during and since the revolution: Faure, Pivert, Thorez, Jouhaux, Blum, Laval, Sartre, and many, many others. They have been given ample time to prepare their defence, some doing so admirably, others going as far as testifying against each other in hopes of reducing their sentence, or on the contrary, choosing to remain entirely silent.\n\nMost of them have been found guilty of the crimes they were accused of: what should their sentence be? Death is the expected sentence, but this would certainly create martyrs. On the other hand, a lighter sentence could seem like a show of weakness to our supporters, and convincing our people that any of these Reds deserve mercy when they refused to show any to anyone standing in the way of their crazed revolution could prove difficult."

Our occupying forces have turned a blind to these barely legitimate courts when they don’t outright supply the guns to shoot the traitors. Simply put, our reconquered people are tearing each other apart, blowing up in anger for they finally see the Reds for what they truly are, enemies of France who led them all to their collective downfall. However, these trials may have gone somewhat out of control, with unsavoury reports coming in of cruel punishments or settling of personal vendettas by the simple accusation of being a committed socialist.

For some, it is a joyous ending to this fratricidal conflict as families are reunited and many rediscover their homeland. For others, it is a tragedy: their kin might have disappeared, their neighbourhood destroyed during the war, or their property collectivized. Some scars will take generations to heal, but the most pressing issue is that of seized property: many are clamouring for what was theirs to be given back.\n\nWe could simply declare all transfer of property undertaken under the syndicalist regime to be null, but expropriating untold numbers of families would certainly not endear us to our reunited people. We could also accept the status quo, legitimize the ownership of seized property, and simply give indemnities to the exiles, but this might feel like a slap in the face to many. Finally, we could set up local committees investigating the claims of returning owners, which would then find a fair compromise between both parties, though this might prove complex and time-consuming."

We cannot afford to simply purge the ranks of the armed forces from all reactionaries, the Grande Muette has hardly ever been in favor of liberal democracy. Instead, we will use a skillful mix of tactical promotions, making sure loyalists rise in ranks, and reassignments: others will be sent in the depths of the desert to monitor some tribe or another. It will be a long process, but it will certainly be effective.\n\nSome within the coalition also hope to cement their influence over our armies, and hope to discreetly include supporters of their opponents among those sent on long Saharan treks, however this would certainly be seen as a great injustice inflicted on loyal Republicans."

The executive office has been given greater power than their more figurative role that they held during the Third Republic to prevent parliament from spinning in circles endlessly. Meanwhile, greater checks and balances are given to each branch of government to ensure no one branch grows ascendant over the others.\n\nWith the creation of a new Republic, [NFA.GetLeader] has called for new elections in party leadership.

Tensions in the wide Union Sacrée coalition around the Colonel had reached a boiling point, as the representatives of the traditional parties of the Third Republic could not bring themselves to agree with the wide political reforms envisioned by the PSF and worked tirelessly behind the scenes to reinforce their positions and bring back some lose prestige to their parties and to the traditional democratic institutions of the Republic. It is even rumoured that Mordacq himself intervened to prevent the coalition from entirely breaking apart in these critical times, and personally asked for the formation of a new government as a  conciliatory measure. This new government headed by the PRD’s Paul Reynaud was presented to the Assembly later in the day and passed a near unanimous vote of confidence.\n\nOf course, this change in course does not mean that the PSF or de La Rocque are now in opposition with the government, and the Colonel himself does not see this as the end of his bid for power: after all the PSF is still an important party, and future electoral fortunes could certainly bring him back in the forefront of politics.

Today, the Colonel announced in front of the Assembly his plans for a constitutional referendum once the war is won, one that would thoroughly transform the institutions of the Republic and create a semi-presidential, democratic, more stable regime, instead of a Republic dominated by her fickle parliament. This was entirely expected of the Colonel, as this has been part of the PSF’s platform since the creation of the party. However, he ended this speech by saying that this constitutional reform would be voted on by referendum, as he argues that the French people are after all sovereign: for reform of such importance, they are the most qualified to decide upon the future of the nation.\n\nThis immediately created an uproar among partisans of the supremacy of parliament. Indeed the last time a referendum was used in such a way, it was by President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to bury the Second Republic. Name calling, accusations of tyranny flew across the hemicycle, members of parliament even came to blows, and by the end of the day it was clear the Union Sacrée had only the nominal support of much of his former allies. As such, a new government was formed under de La Rocque with those sympathetic to his plans, though President Mordacq intervened so that the appearance of unity remains in this critical time. The traditional parties of the Third Republic, in no small part responsible for her fall, have simply been left behind in the dust as Mordacq continues to revolutionise French politics."

After hearing of the news, Napoléon VI paraded magnificently in Paris. He drove down the Champs-Elysées aboard a military vehicle, encircled by a mass of Parisians shouting his name and followed by 3 columns of the best veterans of the last French wars. Napoléon accompanied these warriors first in the reconquest of France and then in the great war to finally retake Alsace-Lorraine. He didn't only command them but fought along them with only the pride of France as his ideal.\n\nThe people of France are now rewarding the War Hero appropriately, they recognised his valor and decided to offer him the throne as a show of their faith in him. The republican politicians were outraged by what they call a coup d'Etat, but Napoléon knows that the French nation is in its people and not its politicians. The emperor didn't get an official religious coronation, choosing to base his legitimacy on the mandate of the people rather than on the church, but did end his Parisian parade with an impressive mass at the church of the Madeleine to show the friendship of the Empire with the thousand-year-old French Catholic church.\n\nThe form of the new state will be a constitutional monarchy. Napoléon VI will thus rule alongside an elected parliament to best serve the interests of the people. The current parliament, dominated by the Bloc National, will be kept and will serve as the first legislature under the Empire.

Then, our long standing ally in the United Kingdom fell apart in 1925 leaving us in no condition to return our colonies to our rule. Ending the last of his tenure as the Governor-General of what remains of French Equatorial Africa, Raphaël Antonetti has made his decision to step down from his post citing a failing in his health in recent years. Antonetti has held the position since 1924, seeing the region through several turbulent times, and well earning his retirement after his service.\n\nWith the seat left vacant, it may now be time to merge our two colonial sub saharan governments into one unified administration. The German Empire remains ascendant across the globe and the split focus on resource allocation is a waste of time and effort.

The young heir of the Bonaparte line, Louis Bonaparte, has expressed interest in serving under the banner of the true French flag. In order to do so however, the law of exile banning heirs of the old imperial dynasties signed in 1886 must be repealed. Louis wishes to join the Algiers academy and offer his military service for the country. Repealing the law may bring some greater levels of support for our government from the monarchist camp, and France needs all the soldiers she can get. On the other hand, this may be seen as an attack against the democratic rule that we wish to return to following our return to the continent."

nfa.310.d:0 "His Majesty Jean III, By the Grace of God, Most Christian King of France has passed away peacefully at 65 years old, in his palace of Algiers. Until his last breath, our King had been eager to serve his country and his nation in the place that was his, a country that he loved with unconditional love, the love of a father, for France and for the French, considering each as his children. Having served in the Great War, since his rise as head of the French Capetians he worked tirelessly to propose an alternative to the failing republic and after de Gaulle’s fateful call to restore the monarchy, to implement the deep reform needed to truly restore the Kingdom of France. But the burden of his increased responsibilities proved too much to bear for the monarch, already deeply affected by the defeat and the exile, and his health had been on a steady decline for some time. The dauphin had stepped in to relieve his father but this wasn’t sufficient, and those in the know knew that the passing of the King was only a matter of time. Part of Jean III’s dream to see his kingdom restored had come true, and with his family attending to him in his last moments, particularly his son the dauphin and his grandson Henri, he knew that the future was assured, that he was leaving the kingdom in good hands, that France would soon be freed, that all the sacrifices endured by his people and by himself had not been in vain, that, at last, he could rest.\n\nA week of national mourning has been decreed, at the end of which King Jean will be buried. Jean, departed from this world and now close to God, is succeeded by his eldest son, Henri, 32 years old. The energetic young man has been particularly active in working first towards the restoration in cooperation with the Action Française, then since his father’s coronation in the matters of state. These last few years, bustling with political activity, have made sure the young prince is more than ready as a statesman, as a shrewd politician, and as King to further his father’s dream.\n\nThe King is dead, long live the King!"

Peers of France and indigenous chiefs then swore fidelity to the newly crowned king, a mass was said, and all headed out of the cathedral.\n\nHis Majesty, instead of immediately heading back to the royal palace for a private reception chose to partake in his people’s revelry, mingling for some time with the crowd assembled to see their new king and delivering a speech radio transmitted throughout the whole empire calling for unity and resolve in the face of the coming hardships, assuring all that the efforts demanded of France and her people will not be in vain. Popular festivities lasted late into the night, and this morning, two things are clear: the continuity of the monarchy is now well assured, and our nation must now be more determined than ever to free our countrymen from the red shackles of the Commune, so that one day the kings of France may be crowned in Reims once again."

Unlike his father’s coronation, the ceremony could follow as closely as possible the rituals established over a millennium by the monarchy. After swearing the traditional oaths and being anointed with oil from the Holy Ampulla, the prince was dressed in the regalia of the kings of France, including some thought lost in the exile like the hand of justice and the scepter of Charles VI, before finally being crowned by the archbishop of Reims. Peers of the reborn kingdom and indigenous chiefs swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said.\n\nOutside the cathedral, though there were cheers and cries of 'Long live the King' along with jeers and insults, the crowd seemed mostly perplexed by this surreal sight: after all, it had been more than a century since a king was last crowned in Reims, and two decades under the Commune had certainly made it seem impossible that such an event would happen again. And so, instead of heading back to the residence of the archbishops of Reims for a private reception, His Majesty chose to head out of the cathedral on foot accompanied by his young son, mingling for some time with his new subjects, almost to prove to the reconquered nation, and perhaps to himself, that this was all indeed real: the red beast was slain, the kingdom was well and truly reborn, this war pitting brothers against brothers was over. Henri VI then delivered a speech radio transmitted throughout France and her empire, assuring that with his coronation, a new era has dawned, an era of order, peace and prosperity, and that all the sacrifices France had endured will not be in vain. While in some areas popular celebrations lasted well into the night, in others riots broke out: the King will have to prove himself to much of our nation."

Special tribunals were created, with the crowd gathering in every town to see those who had betrayed them for so long get what was long coming. At last the “pays légal” was tumbling. Trials were often somewhat rushed, but most were given time to prepare their defense, with proper legal assistance provided if they could not afford one.

In any case, though some will have to be shot, at the very least to set an example, most of the men interrogated could be reintegrated within the ranks without much penalty: the core of Mordacq’s clique was blown apart along with their leader, and unified opposition from the armed forces seems unlikely"

We must however tread carefully: these are all incredibly talented men, and our investigation seems to show that they acted more by loyalty to each other than any deep ideological commitment. The Rooster, personally close to some of the men of the Bureau, seems to think that simply court-circuiting the mole, feeding him inaccurate information for him to share to planted contacts and letting the Bureau remain intact will be sufficient: after all there are few open Republicans left, sacrificing valuable assets to fight shadows seems like a waste.

nfa.401.d:0 "Critical to the stability of the regime, the Society of the Missionaries of Africa is a Catholic society of apostolic life focusing on evangelism and education in Africa. Founded in 1868 in Algiers, they quickly became an integral part of colonial society, adapting to native customs, adopting the native dress, all the while accomplishing a tremendous amount of ethnographical and geographic research. They have been on the forefront of French initiatives on the continent, despite their sometimes strained relationship with an increasingly anticlerical republican government. They have become staunch advocates for the native populations, even accepting native priests, never hesitating to side with them against the colonial authorities when needed and generally acting as a bridge between the two, earning them the affectionate nickname of \"White Fathers\".\n\nIn the troubled times since the revolution, they have become downright crucial to maintaining French authority over what is left of the empire, working tirelessly to maintain the peace between colonists, exiles, and natives with the full support of the Marshal’s conservative government."

nfa.402.d:0 "Founded in the ’20s by Ferhat Abbas in the chaos of the exile, calling itself the principal media outlet of integral nationalism alongside the main Action Française, Action Algérienne has become one of the most popular newspapers within the Algerian departments. Its slogan, \"From Colony to Province\", summarises its fight alongside integralist principles: assimilation within a greater France, while still retaining privileges, traditions and local laws against the centralisation and disregard for indigenous customs of the Republic. Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber Muslim population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the indigènes."

nfa.403.d:0 "Jacques Bainville, born in 1879, renowned historian, journalist, and one of the founders of the Action Française, has died at 57 years old. Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled \"The Political Consequences of Peace\", Bainvillle exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among exiles, and Bainville’s funeral procession was followed by thousands of mourners, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending his funeral mass. The Lion of Verdun himself put out a statement honouring the life and works of the historian now seen as a prophet by many."

The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture. It stands as a powerful symbol of the success of missionary work within the French colonial empire and especially that of the Pères Blancs. It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thénévoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thénévoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed. However, the apostolic vicar has always dismissed claims that true power in Haute-Volta lies with him, presenting himself as nothing more than a humble missionary blessed with some success, caring for his flock."

nfa.406.d:0 "\"Integral Humanism. Temporal and spiritual problems of a new Christianity\", the recently published work of influential Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain has caused passionate debate among Catholics. A convert from Protestantism, once close to the Action Française despite not being a monarchist, mostly out of suspicion towards representative democracy and opposition to the anticlerical policies of the Third Republic, Maritain has drifted after the shock of the exile towards more moderate positions, closer to the personalist movement and Christian democracy. Rejecting both reaction and liberalism, secularism and intransigent political Catholicism, embracing humanism, arguing for human rights, the importance of family, pluralistic democracy and responsibility toward the common good, all in the spirit of the social teachings of the Church, the philosopher is somewhat going against the grain. Indeed, much of the French Catholic laity and hierarchy has been radicalised by the current situation: the AF has even denounced \"Integral Humanism\" as the work of a traitor, a sell-out to \"democratism\", a red saboteur. However among more progressive Catholics Maritain’s work was very well received, getting praise from Father Montini, a close advisor of the pope, and with some moderates even being drawn away from the Action Française, heeding his warning that the movement is merely using the Faith as a tool to further their political ideology."

The movie, retelling the life of Blessed Charles de Foucauld, had found critical acclaim and great commercial success: indeed, he has fascinated the French public for years now. Charles Eugène, viscount de Foucauld would have seemed for much of his early life an unlikely candidate for the devotion now surrounding him. Born into an aristocratic family, he lived a dissolute life, eventually becoming a cavalry officer. This experience spurred him to leave his old life behind: he decided to take the vows, attracted by an ascetic life of poverty among the Tuaregs with whom he formed deep bonds, learning their language, translating the Scriptures, and preaching through example. Seen as a saintly man by natives, authorities and the Church’s hierarchy, a tragic end awaited him: caught in the conflict with the Senussi, he was martyred on the 1st of December 1916.\n\nDesert hermit, saintly martyr, pioneer of French influence in the most remote corners of the empire, Father Charles became a national icon, his total abandonment to God and asceticism inspiring many Catholics, leading some to rethink their positions on native populations and Islam as a whole. His recent beatification has even led the Academy of Colonial Sciences to petition the papacy so that he be made patron saint of colonisation: the regime, however, hasn’t waited for him to be officially recognised as such, and prominently uses him as a propaganda piece, despite de Foucauld’s frequent criticism of colonial attitudes."

nfa.408.d:0 "On June 7 1919, riots broke out in Valletta, capital of the then British crown colony of Malta. Tensions with the British authorities had brewed for some time and the heavy burden of the Weltkrieg on the fortress island, as well as rising food prices, proved too much for thousands who ransacked locations associated with the British: when they attempted to force entry into a government building, soldiers opened fire. The crowd dispersed, and four laid dead. Ever since this grim day, it has been commemorated by the Maltese. As the British revolution came to a close in 1926, local authorities became increasingly nervous for the future of Malta, with mutiny, nationalist and socialist agitation, or occupation by another power seeming like increasingly real threats: the Germans being already in the process of seizing much of the empire would certainly not pass up an opportunity to spread their influence to the Mittelmeer. As such, the governor, Sir Walter Norris Congreve, called on us to secure the islands for the Entente, and French marine infantry obliged. Malta was granted much autonomy in dealing with day to day matters, officially still part of the British Empire but by now effectively a French protectorate, a state of affairs acceptable to both the small British elite content with maintaining their power and nationalists now enjoying something approaching home rule. As such, the Sette Giugno was made an official holiday of remembrance and hope for unity. Though no longer the headquarter of the Mediterranean fleet, the island is still the lock of the Strait of the Sicily, the bastion assuring Entente dominance over the Western Mediterranean: a large garrison is maintained on the island and much was invested to expand the defences and ports of the islands, reflecting its critical role in our naval strategy."

It was dedicated to the tens of thousands of Corsicans who gave their lives for France during the Weltkrieg and subsequent civil war. Since the revolution, the island has been an incredibly important bastion for us: indeed, it is so close from the Commune that its shores can be seen on a clear day, while Red Italy is less than 40 kilometres away. As such it has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and airbase from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the mainland, with tense face-offs with Internationale ships occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of exiles landed, and though most moved on to Algeria, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that paired with the military build-up has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms. Though there is no longer a stream of refugees like in the early days of the Commune, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero’s welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul \"the Emperor\" Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the métropole. The authorities, however, turn a blind eye to this, as the mafia has proved to be an incredibly useful network of informants within the Commune, all the while attending to the baser needs of infantrymen and officers alike."

Fascinated with the idea of flying and inspired by the prototypes of French engineer Clément Ader and the successes of the Wright brothers, Blériot put the profits of his automobile parts business towards the creation of flying machines. First encountering so many failures that the press derisively nicknamed him the \"King of Crashing\", he eventually achieved worldwide fame and recognition for being the first to cross the Channel in an aeroplane in 1909, in only 37 minutes. A living legend of aviation, even being attributed to the first pilot’s license, he created a successful firm building his ever-improving designs. With the Great War, he specialised in light reconnaissance planes, his company producing eventually more than ten thousand planes for the French army. At the outbreak of the revolution, Blériot fled to Algeria like so many others and successfully re-implemented his business, Blériot Aéronautique, the Marshal encouraging research and development in any field with any potential to help the coming war effort, eventually running as a candidate for the Parti Radical.\n\nFollowing his death, the government has put out a statement honouring his contribution to the field of aviation and to the war effort, as well as his resilience facing his early setback, calling him an example to all Frenchmen in these difficult times.

Appointed by the colonial authorities first as imam then as a mufti, unpopular and frequently brazenly critical of even mild reformist talk, Bendali had many powerful enemies. After a rough interrogation session, the murderer confessed to being merely a pawn in a greater scheme, offered thousands of francs to kill the imam by the true mastermind behind the crime: a prominent member of the reformist Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, Tayeb el-Okbi. Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the state under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many Algerians and some Frenchmen believe this is a conspiracy, and that el-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment. We could drop charges against el-Okbi, somewhat losing face but preventing any further unrest and possibly gaining an ally within the Association, or we could keep him in jail, getting rid of a prominent indigène leader and sowing dissent among the ulemas."

A master of physical comedy and slapstick, adding to it a talent for singing, his movies generally featuring a few humorous songs that then prove to be successes in their own right, he has often been compared to American actor Charlie Chaplin. This time the actor plays Fernand, a hen-pecked husband who, after getting knocked out, wakes up in a caravan heading towards the Algerian interior, his identity papers stolen and replaced by new ones: he is now another man, a new volunteer in the French Foreign Legion. Incapable of explaining his situation to his officer, Fernand is called to fight some unruly tribe deep in the Sahara desert, and despite early mishaps, he quickly finds military life much more enjoyable than his marriage, and especially much less disciplined. Now truly a whole new man, he is eventually tracked down by his wife but instead chooses to re-enlist under his real name, becoming a veritable hero and eventually being awarded the Legion of honour.The humorous tale has proven particularly popular among veterans."

Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners, sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering \"All is Grace\".\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticizing clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this \"Diary\", a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."

Telling the story of captain Benoit, played by Jean Murat, sent on a mission by the Second Bureau, our elusive military intelligence agency, to seize the blueprints of the latest red weapon in the very heart of the Commune, this movie has it all: action, suspense, and of course, romance. Of course, the handsome captain is eventually noticed by Communard counter-intelligence, who sends their best agent after him: Elise, true femme fatale, tasked with seducing the agent. Of course the two fall in love, and plan on escaping together: as the Communards realise this, she sacrifices herself and dies in her lover’s arms, forcefully reminded of his duty to France.\n\nCritics hated it, calling it cheap entertainment, and yet, the public loved it, and asked for more, dismissing rumours that the film received state funding to transform the public image of the secretive and sometimes sinister agency as mere Communard propaganda."

His exploits are told like epic tales in newspapers and newsreels, and he has become something of a national hero, even getting involved in politics with Colonel de La Rocque’s PSF and advocating for the development of air travel.

Set in Algiers, particularly in the labyrinthic and exotic old town, the Casbah, the movie tells the story of Pépé, played by Gabin, a former big shot in the Parisian underworld now in hiding, and the men trying to catch him, both law enforcement and syndicalist agents looking to put down once and for all a major organizer of the black market within the Commune. Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, played by Balin, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to \"slum it\" among natives and emigrants in the sensual and dangerous world of the Casbah. The two strike up a relationship, igniting the jealousy of Pépé’s mistress. This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it’s hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic. And Pépé, quintessential anti-hero, criminal but principled, has become a bit of a youth icon as many identify with his situation at the crossroad of two worlds, French and native, as well as with his melancholic longing for Paris."

Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, a sense of belonging, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell’s books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys around seven years old, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford. However, these groups have remained largely isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts that would permit greater cooperation and uniformisation of scouting practices among the indigènes. Already, prominent native voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along with loyalty to France, while some more conservative pieds-noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the patrie they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria. More pragmatic voices in government argue that giving our approval to this federation would grant us much greater oversight over a largely autonomous initiative."

In these trying times, it’s hardly surprising that the peoples of Europe and beyond are prone to melancholy, however, rumours have been circulating about the song: that it is linked with an ever-increasing number of suicides, in France, the United States, and the composer’s homeland, Hungary, and that merely listening to the tune could push even the cheeriest individual towards suicidal ideation. Whether this is a fact, a mere urban rumour, or a clever marketing campaign, the song has already been banned from airing on the radio or even being sung publicly in more than a few countries, which only adds to the credibility of rumours about the now-infamous \"Hungarian suicide song\".\n\nHere too, a debate has raged on the question of a potential ban, an almost welcome break from the usual political fracas.

And indeed each year the patriotic celebrations organised around the shrine built for the relic are more and more popular, with tens of thousands in attendance for a day culminating in an open-air mass, including numerous parliamentarians, officials, bishops, intellectuals, veterans, and officers, and this year even [NFA.GetLeader] himself.\n\nHowever despite the association claiming that it seeks to remain apolitical, and the \"Pucelle\" being revered by most of the political spectrum, many seek to use the event to further their political agenda.

However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of red terror, profanations, and acts of syndicalist violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil. Committees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, \"Aux Martyrs Espagnols\" calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs: it has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."

Slowly, indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become an incredibly popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club’s goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."

Set in a German prison camp during the Great War, the movie follows three French officers, one of working-class background, an aristocrat, and a nouveau riche naturalised Polish Jew and their efforts to escape captivity. Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the war is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling a wide variety of themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the war ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House. In any case, it has become an instant classic."

Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution brewing in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat’s hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of \"Soldier-Prince\" and a promotion to the rank of general. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco’s national day falling on the Prince’s patron saint’s feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France’s political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince’s palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."

Born in a royalist family but rallied to the Republic, he turned down the opportunity of a military career and instead dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting the integration of physical activity in education. But de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and for them to become an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Panhellenic games, and the first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics couldn’t prevent the madness of the Great War, and following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Already heartbroken by the death at the front of two nephews, the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics, that neither Frances attended, and the subsequent establishment of the Spartakiades, left de Coubertin a broken shell of a man, his dream crumbling before his eyes. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."

Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony. Since the exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the métropole."

He chronicles the slow descent into indignity of the working classes over the last century and a half, caused by usurious industrial capitalism and new illegitimate elites, culminating in the 1919 revolution, an event that he considers engineered by nefarious forces exploiting the legitimate grievances of the masses. Prince Henri then makes a passionate case for the monarchy, the only regime he claims could truly restore the dignity of the people by upholding tradition and the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThe work was well-received and sold well, thanks to tireless promotion by the Action Française and praise by influential clergy, already being translated in multiple languages and published abroad, though some were shocked by the violence of Henri’s denunciation of capitalism and the bourgeoisie.

Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation \"to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser\", proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from “civilized” people and that they too have a long and rich history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself Dahomean. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing a generally pro-French sentiment but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction. This decision which could have proved controversial has instead been generally met with praise from much of colonial society, though for varying reasons: where some évolués see proof, if one was ever needed, of the intellectual equality of the Black man, some in the colonial government see proof of the success of the civilising mission."

Their relationship is cordial and polite enough, though understandably chilly due to geopolitical considerations, but a fight breaking out between sailors of the different crews prevents any further fraternisation. However, an incident brings them together: arms traffickers are spotted leaving the harbour, and in their flight have released poison gas. The deadly cloud is slowly drifting towards a passenger ship, and the men put aside their differences to save the civilians, going straight through the gas with little protection: the civilians are rescued and the traffickers stopped. Despite their heroism, all the crews lose some men, including the Red British officer, and they are all buried with full military honours.\n\nDirected by the profoundly Catholic director Léo Joannon, filmed at sea with the help of our navy, on real ships and with real sailors as extras, the movie was hit with criticism from some who found distasteful the positive image of the German and British characters, going as far as taxing the movie of pacifism. Against such critics, the director argued that the core message of the picture is one of Christian fraternity, bravery and camaraderie in the face of adversity, despite eternally rising international tensions."

In a nation where everything is mobilised for the coming war effort like ours, each and every one of us can identify with this sentiment: we will fight, and we will win because we must retake our home!"

This measure was necessary to coordinate the various actions taken by opponents to the syndicalist regime such as the distribution of tracts, preparations to hamper the war effort, recruitment, bribery, or discrete weapon training as tensions ramp up a bit more each day.

In remembrance of this intervention, each family ritually slaughters an animal and shares it in three: one third going to the poor, one third to relatives, and one third is kept and eaten. The faithful then go to their local mosque, and at the conclusion of the Eid prayers and sermons, they exchange greetings, gifts, and visit one another.\n\nConsidered the holiest holiday of the Muslim faith, it is always accompanied by large festivities and is sometimes even the occasion to lower confessional barriers, as some Muslims invite their non-Muslim neighbours and friends to partake in this uniquely Islamic celebration."

The Apostle Paul's message from his epistle to the Romans that \"I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us,\" became a central message of the new church. These challenges pushed many to delve deep into the scriptures and diligently reinforce their faith.\n\nRecently, a large effort has been undertaken by the local population to reach across language barriers to their fellow Bobo people. Red Bobo Christians have reached out to Black Bobos living in their district to bring the gospel to them.

Furthermore, with Guénon's conversion to Sufism many of these Masons and other types are increasingly interested in the native Sufi Tariqas or Orders. With the AF now in power, this relationship is increasingly troubling, with some proclaiming it the return of Gnosticism and Quietism, both of which are excommunicated heresies.

This occultist milieu produced various New Religious and Philosophical Currents claiming ancient lineages and hidden knowledge, supposedly handed down by cabals of Masons, Magicians and Alchemists. From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental Religions and Metaphysical Systems. However, following the defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-Materialist tracts and published "The Crisis of the Modern World" in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, “Oriental Metaphysics” is a detailed exploration of Oriental Metaphysical Systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the Liberal worldview of their recent past in favour of a Traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences. Calls for a ban of the book have arisen from clergy and conservative Catholics, while others argue that it could be helpful in evangelisation, or control, of the natives."

Our current exile has led many, particularly academics and clergymen, to seek a better understanding of the faith of so many of our countrymen. Some out of genuine interest or hope of interfaith dialogue, while others dream of large-scale conversion of the indigènes to Christianity. A recent open letter published anonymously in “En Terre d’Islam” is threatening the fragile religious equilibrium, however. The letter, calling for the formation of a “Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims” to “pray for our estranged brothers” was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Morrocan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to “study the enemy”, a year later he would convert, two and he joined the Fransciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."

As the crowds grew however, a cursory investigation was initiated by our intelligence services. Shockingly, they found that this “François-Henry Prométhée” has never existed, and is merely the pseudonym of Maurice Delaunay, a farmer from Normandy, who after brilliant studies at the National Institute for Horticulture and a brief stint in politics has seemingly lost his mind.

Going through most major towns of the Algerian littoral, such as Orléanville, Oran, Bone, starting and ending in Algier, with even a detour through Tunisia, the race was a massive popular success, giving bicycle racing fans the euphoria of a national sporting competitions they had seeked for close to two decades by now.

In the Great War, his father too had attempted to join the Foreign Legion but was denied from it due the Law of Exile barring representatives of the former reigning houses from setting foot in France.

Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois. \nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto. All clad in their green-trimmed formal attire, complete with personalised ornate swords and bicornes, the 473 members of the Institute have signed a common appeal to the world to undermine the efforts of these 'perverts' and 'bohemians', and penned a manifesto in which they call for the creation of a international 'Institute of Occident' to fight the 'vanguard of inculture'. This initiative has received wide acclaim in France and among our Entente allies, as well as from the German sphere. \nAs for the International Avant-Garde, it responded by setting up an abstract statue representing 'bourgeois culture' and 'classicism' made out of copies of the manifesto in front of the former location of the Institut de France, in Paris.

History proved that hope wrong, but this hasn’t stopped this debate from arising every year.

Under the unofficial leadership of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, this association of theologians, teachers and more generally learned men has come to promote Islamic reform, hoping to bring Islam in Algeria to its pure original form, away from the superstitions fostered by the marabouts and the more mystical approach of the Sufi congregations. Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, skeptical of both the sincerity of the AF’s promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Communards."

Some dare to whisper that the Comité is merely a front for a renewed dictatorship under Mordacq, and already some intellectuals and politicians openly criticise the General. However, one thing that was restored immediately after the fall of Pétain is freedom of expression: these men have the right to speak their mind, no matter how wrong they are, and how potentially destabilising this kind of talk is.\n\nWe could simply let it go and hope the debate runs its course, or we could take a more proactive approach.

Finally free from censorship, it seems journalists are relishing in this effort to tear down the man who restored freedom of expression. The government has so far ignored the situation, but letting this criticism go unanswered much longer could durably undermine the new regime and jeopardise our efforts to save the nation. Of course restoring censorship would be unthinkable, but there exist legal means to stifle this flow of defamation.

Invoking the 1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press, they were accused of inciting 'offences against the public interest', and were put on trial. \nThis, however, backfired. Not only this made the Comité de Salut National look tyrannical, and made the criticism look founded, but it was utterly ineffective. The trials were turned into platforms for these men to criticise the new political order, arguing that it was at best another flavor of tyranny, and that this effort to stifle their right to freedom of expression went against the very ideals that led them to fight against the Pétain regime.

It took a particularly brave foreign journalist to ask the one question on everyone’s mind: 'General, will you uphold the fundamental liberties of Frenchmen?'\n\nAnd finally, Mordacq spoke. 'It is true that we live in extraordinary times, and as such extraordinary measures are necessary. This is no longer the time for discussion but the time of action, and action, true action, action that produces results, requires a single will. We must unite if we want to win, and we must win for the salvation of France. However, and this has always been my promise to our people, these measures are indeed extraordinary and will not be maintained for more than they are necessary. Democracy has always been the hope of not only France, but all of Europe, I simply ask my fellow Frenchmen to trust the Comité and myself to lead them to victory.

Much of the necessary ceremonial items, like the sword Joyeuse, said to have been the sword of Charlemagne, as well as the Holy Ampulla, glass vial holding anointing oil said to have been given by the Holy Spirit for the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, had been evacuated during the retreat from the mainland and new regalia was crafted by skilled artisans, particularly an ornate crown.\n\nAfter swearing oaths on the Scriptures to defend the Church, maintain peace, fight injustice, be merciful and just, as well as fight heresy, Jean d’Orléans was anointed in nine spots in the shape of a cross with holy oil by the archbishop of Algiers, then was draped in a blue cloak sprinkled with gold fleurs-de-lys, given the scepter and the hand of justice, and, finally, crowned. Peers of the reborn kingdom swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said. This done, the king and the royal family headed out for their new residence, the former presidential palace in the heights of Algiers, cheered on the whole way there by a numerous crowd, public celebrations and banquets taking place well into the late hours of the night. Some important details were altered in the ceremony, however: the king did not swear the traditional oath to fight infidels and was instead given by the mufti of Algiers a traditional flyssa sword representing his new status of Hāmī al-Islām or Protector of Islam, and among the peers swearing fidelity to His Majesty were numerous Arab, Berber or African chiefs in their traditional costumes, symbol of a new era of French rule."

In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality. Idem when a Third Republic was declared in 1870. Though they were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women’s suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women’s suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband’s will, or worse,\n the Church’s.Charles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."

But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d’Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armored: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."

The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regnum Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place.

The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

To prove the princely commitment to their long-time allies and protectors, the heir to the principality Rainier even followed in the footsteps of his father and joined the French army in the later stages of the war, serving with distinction.\n\nWith Monaco freed from the grasps of the Communards, their loyalty has of course been rewarded and Louis II has officially proclaimed the restoration of the independence of the Principality from the balcony of the Prince's Palace in front of cheering Monégasques. Though a part of the population had initially welcomed the annexation, it quickly became clear that without independence, gambling or tourism, the former principality was little more than a backwards if pretty little town and opinion towards the Communards quickly soured. A treaty was signed later in the day with French representatives, deepening the mutual commitment of the two states towards each other already established by the 1918 treaty of 'protective friendship', and ensuring that the fate of France and Monaco would from now on forever be linked."

Coming from a prestigious family of ulema, claiming to be descendents from the medieval Zyrid dynasty which had ruled Ifriqiya centuries ago, Ben Badis was destined to a comfortable life as an Islamic scholar, part of the native elites far from the struggles of his fellow indigènes. Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centers of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the “City of Bridges”. As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the pieds-noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of independentist talk."

Indeed, it seems that none of the operatives even know the name of their hierarchical superior and meetings are kept to a strict minimum. But we have finally been contacted by its leader, Alsatian textile industrialist Paul Dungler, nicknamed Commandant Martial, a citizen of the Reich. With German cash, given under the pretenses of funding study of the Genisteae flower in the hills of the Vosges region, Commandant Martial quickly built a disciplined network gathering information on Communard infrastructure and troop movements in the East, implementing weapons and explosives caches all over the Vosges and in Alsace, creating armed networks in Lorraine as well as stay-behind groups should the Commune advance past the Vosges. However, unbeknown to his German patrons, Dungler believes that Alsace is a rightful part of France and his network has been gathering an immense wealth of information from within the German intelligence framework as well as cultivating links within the armies of the Reich of disgruntled Alsatian soldiers and officers.\n\nHe has now offered us his services as a double agent, giving us access to his network to prepare the liberation of France, and we would be foolish to refuse. Though the Germans know his network as the Réseau Martial (Martial Network), to us he will become the “Alsace 7th Column”, as the deeply Catholic Dungler believes 7 is a holy number.

Despite these conciliatory words, for close to two decades they enviously observed as we spread French civilisation and built a globe-spanning empire. More than once, we rebuked their attempts at expansion: they made us pay this dearly. Utterly defeated in Africa, their subjects breathing a sigh of relief as the Teuton yoke was finally lifted, we were nevertheless forced to concede to Germany much of our colonies as part of the conditions of the 1919 Armistice. We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favorable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, behemothic patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar es Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé von Göring as head of the chimeric \"Deutsch-Mittelafrika\", the overambitious Flying Ogre only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered.

The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly reestablish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources.

With strict discipline, exemplary morality, strenuous physical exercise inspired by scoutism and military training, long hours of study and a deep sense of camaraderie, Lieutenant Dunoyer de Segonzac hopes to create a New Man entirely dedicated to national interests.

nfa.534.d:0 "The sleepy little village of Vimoutiers in Normandie, whose only claim to fame was its tenuous revendication as the birthplace of the famous Camembert cheese, was heavily damaged in the recent fighting, particularly after retreating Red British troops attempted to create a temporary stronghold. Much like in so many cities and villages across France, it will take years to rebuild. However, one heap of slowly rusting metal is turning into a playground for local children and attracting the curiosity of a few onlookers: a disabled heavy British tank in particularly good shape, once a lynchpin of the local Syndicalist defense, stuck in a ditch right outside Vimoutiers. \n\nOf course, the authorities attempted to seize the tank as part of the country-wide effort to heal the scars of the war, either to scrap it for parts and metal or study it further. But the Vimonastériens refused, even chasing away one cleanup crew: children cried at the thought of losing their playground, while the adults had grown strangely attached to the wreck. Of course the near pristine state of the tank has spurned numerous jokes about the bravery of the British troops but mostly the locals seem fascinated by the object, its newfound peaceful quietness perhaps a symbol of the slow return to normalcy across France. In any case, the local mayor said he intends to turn the tank into a monument. What should be done?"

nfa.535.d:0 "Following the meeting of Prince Henri with His Holiness, the Prince has embarked on a campaign to honor the memory of the Pontifical Zouaves, a regiment of pious mostly French volunteers who defended the Papal States until the conquest of Rome by the Kingdom of Italy in 1870. Following the fall of the Eternal City, these volunteers immediately headed to France to fight bravely in the Franco-Prussian War. These devout Catholics, many of them royalists, headed by Baron Athanase de Charette de La Contrie, descendant of a famous leader of the Vendée insurrection, nevertheless set aside their differences with the Republic to fight against the Prussian aggressor. Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading “Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France” was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit. They will head to Rome and proudly stand guard on the Tiber, representing the French faithful united as one in their duty to defend the Church."

It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honor, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty. The Republic in her foolish civilising mission had sought to turn the Indigène into a Frenchman. The Monarchy only asks of the Indigène one thing: to serve France, and be ready to fight and die for his King."

Once the rulers of the island from where they embarked on numerous raids against Barbary pirates, a true fighting force made up of the noblest warriors of Christendom, the Knights were defeated by the armies of the impostor Bonaparte. Malta annexed, its possessions seized, the Order was exiled and dispersed. The Hospitallers instead chose to focus on their original mission, caring for the poor and sick. With one exception: an elite auxiliary military corps, mostly dedicated to medical functions, serving with the Italian army. But united Italy is no more and therein lies the agreement the Knights are offering us. In exchange of rather limited concessions, for example granting extraterritoriality to some locations historically associated with the Order, the Knights are offering to reform their auxiliary force to serve under the French flag, assisting us in our crusade to free the Métropole. Of course this would mean taking liberties with a British colony, something our friends would not appreciate, and the actual benefits to us would largely consist in a propaganda opportunity, though the expertise of the Order is undeniable.

Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies. \n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany. These groups have even had some limited but rather positive effects, fostering good relations between our nations and turning into what could be described as an international think tank of fellow-minded Integralists."

nfa.539.d:0 "The Hajj is a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca established by the Prophet Muhammad. Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu’min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfill this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire. \n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."

nfa.540.d:0 "This winter is particularly rough, and all over France the scars of war run deep: many are still without a home, in the streets or in precarious living conditions, crowded in refugee camps. Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest  has taken to the radio to call for an “insurrection of Goodness”. Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised “Emmaüs” welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national preeminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shockwave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and “Abbé Henri” as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of a Emmaüs charity network are already underway.

The biggest of these is the Mossi kingdom, headed by the current Moogo Naaba, Naba Koom II. It holds the legacy of the most powerful kingdom in the region before French colonization, which spread its power far beyond its capital of Ouagadougou to neighbouring kingdoms. However, other kingdoms such as Tenkodogo, Fada N'Gourma, Boussouma or Ouahigouya still exist along with their kings and continue to vie for influence in Haute-Volta. \nIn this context, a dispute recently arose between the Moogo Naaba and the other kingdoms. Indeed, Naba Koom II praised the work of the native ethnologist Antoine Dim Delobsom "The Empire of the Mogho-Naba" (L'empire du Mogho-Naba). The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies. However, the book also spreads a view of the country as being almost complied to bow under the Moogo Naaba, feeding and legitimating the still very existent ambitions of Naba Koom II to make the Mossi kingdom the dominant power in Haute-Volta. This display of ambitions didn't sit well with the other kings, wary of the Moogo Naaba playing between the interests of the French colonists and those of the population to assert the power of the Mossi once again. \nRepresentatives of each kingdom came in a delegation to the seat of the colonial governor in Ouagadougou to compell him to take a stand of the matter.

Even if only in his 20's, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observants were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Etoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land. \nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd.

'Why are the ones in Dakar so rich yet we struggle to live correctly?' \nIf Senegal is still far from being prone to revolt, a few strikes have already been put down in the last years and this situation needs to be kept to scrutiny."
nfa.469.a:0 "Well let's hope all of that doesn't breed syndicalism"

nfa.470.t:0 "'Evolués' Support the Idea of Independence"
nfa.470.d:0 "Our source about this issue is a French member of the colonial administration in Dakar, invited by friends to a mondane dinner in which rich French and Black 'évolués' (evoluted) merchants sat together. The administrator expected a friendly atmosphere, after all the 'évolués' have the French citizenship and hold a lot of privileges compared to their black lower class counterparts, suffering under the Code de l'Indigénat. His surprise was thus big when he heard a group of 'évolués' talk about how could Senegal organise itself after an independence. The discussion was unbelievable, the 'évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny anymore. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar... The lesson of the story anyway, is that some of the 'évolués' can unbelievably come back to bite the hand that fed them."
nfa.470.a:0 "This type of thinking doesn't fit a presumably evoluted person"

nfa.476.t:0 "The Prophet of Iriba"
nfa.476.d:0 "In Iriba, a small city in Chad, a man started calling himself a new prophet. First he encouraged the locals to kill their cattle to prevent them from transforming into lions, panthers and vultures. Then he told them that they had to stop paying their taxes and throw away their French money. Finally, he announced that White people were leaving the country: the governor of the nearby city of Biltine had already been driven out by natives, and that it was their duty to kill all Whites left to be able to finally live free. To help them fulfill this mission from Allah, the dead would even come back to life and swarm the French garrisons. Not that they had anything to fear: according to the “prophet”, the guns of the Frenchmen now only fired water.\n\n Few were truly convinced, but the brewing resentment of the peoples of Chad only needed the tiniest spark: a small insurgency broke out under the leadership of the madman, a returning patrol was swarmed and massacred and soon the local garrison was under siege. Order was quickly restored and the madman publicly executed, but the whole strange affair is a warning: the situation far from Algiers is more than volatile."
nfa.476.a:0 "At least now they know our guns still fire bullets."

nfa.477.t:0 "Clash Against the Tuaregs"
nfa.477.d:0 "The war led against the Tuaregs of Niger during the 1910's had been successful, but led to other unsuspected problems. The Tuaregs, having being driven off some of the usual roaming lands, had been made to sometimes live in more inhospitable regions. There, unable to rely on cattle farming like they usually do, they had to get more creative. This was the reason for their attack this morning on a Nigerien village, close from the desert but fertile enough to have farms and reserves. A small Tuareg force arrived at dawn to pillage the farms and steal the food reserves, but they didn't anticipate the presence of a small French patrol resting in the village. The French presence wasn't planned, and it only constituted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuaregs. A few shots made one of the horses fall, with a Tuareg tribesman falling on his head. Another Tuareg was shot in the belly, and a French soldier was gravely injured before the force fled and left the village. The French soldiers got to congratulate themselves before leaving to help their wounded friend, the village however had to rebuild on its own."
nfa.477.a:0 "That'll teach you!"

nfa.478.t:0 "Assassination in Chad!"
nfa.478.d:0 "Grave news has arrived to the colonial headquarters of Chad in Abéché. Another French official got attacked this morning and later died in the hospital. These assassinations of Frenchmen are fairly frequent as a sign of protest against the colonial rule which has the record of brutally imposing its decisions in the recently conquered region of Chad. Investigation is always hard in a region where the population isn't cooperative and it is likely we will never find the murderer, as always."
nfa.478.a:0 "At least we can pray for his soul"

nfa.479.t:0 "Attack On a Patrol in Niger"
nfa.479.d:0 "We quite often send patrols across the north of Niger to assure our supremacy in these lands. As we don't have a lot of permanent bases there from where to assert our control we have to resort to such regular patrols. The patrols are usually uneventful but it wasn't the case this time. Our soldiers were suddenly attacked by a full Tuareg force armed and determined, they were hiding behind a relief waiting for the patrol to come closer before they charged with cavalry towards it. The first panicked shots of the patrol did make a few horses fall; however it soon was the French horses that started to fall as another group of Tuaregs hidden in the dunes started shooting from another angle. Completely helpless and surprised, soldiers fell left and right to the bullets and the blades of the Tuaregs before the survivors retreated disorderly. One of the survivors managed to get back to the nearest colonial outpost to tell this story.\n\nThe attack is an outrage but we are quite powerless to punish them unless we send a full blown army to search the desert. We will have to punish people nearer from us, who are probably Tuareg collaborators anyway..."
nfa.479.a:0 "An outrage!"

nfa.600.t:0 "Backed Rebellion in [revolter.GetNameDef]"
nfa.600.d:0 "The natives in [revolter.GetNameDef] have been armed and organised by the occupier of the colony for weeks starting from when our forces were repelled from the region. They have now assembled a strong enough force to declare independence themselves and have also declared open revolt against our rule."
nfa.600.a:0 "Another one? We must get this under control!"

nfa.601.t:0 "[revolter.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence"
nfa.601.d:0 "After kicking out our troops, [revolter.GetNameDef] has declared independence. Should we crush them with our superior forces, or should we cut our losses to focus elsewhere?"
nfa.601.a:0 "They must remain a part of the Empire!"
nfa.601.b:0 "We have more important matters than crushing native rebellions."

NFA_gets_event_revolt:0 "Gets event '§H[?revolter_var.GetNameDefCap] declares its independence§!'."

nfa.614.t:0 "Victory against the French colonists!"
nfa.614.d:0 "When we started our revolt, no one knows what it was going to lead too, some were pessimistic, others more optimistic but everyone was determined to fight for our independence. This determination has now borne its fruit and after this long war, the French colonists had no other choice than to offer us peace and recognise that their rule over our country has ended. This day will be marked forever as the glorious day of our independence."
nfa.614.a:0 "Let us rejoice!"

nfa.623.t:0 "The Collapse of the French Empire"
nfa.623.d:0 "With Algeria occupied, the center of our power in Africa has now fallen to enemy advance. Without our administrative base, it becomes impossible to continue ruling over Africa, our domination has thus de facto ended in our colonial possessions. Everywhere in Africa, our garrisons and administrators are thrown out by emboldened mobs of natives. Our officials and soldiers have to flee to whatever place feels more secure, but soon there won't be any of those anymore. Some Frenchmen already plan to flee to continue the fight, but most of them accept this fact: the war is lost, and we will soon be strangers in our own home.\n\nThe French state in exile is no more."
nfa.623.a:0 "Fin du jeu"

nfa.624.t:0 "The Collapse of the French Empire"
nfa.624.d:0 "We have lost control. The Empire of thousands of square kilometers, spanning several ancient kingdoms and thousands of ecosystems, lakes, savananas and forests we built of ourselves in Africa is no longer in our control. Our army was pushed back by native revolts, revealing themselves way more organised and efficient that we first thought. The first defeat came off as a terrible blow, but then it kept getting downhill, until putting our heartland of Algeria in danger. The situation is truly hopeless. Our only chance to survive more than a few weeks is now to recognise the independance of all of the native states and retreat back to Algeria where we can hope to reorganise and defend our nation. With a bit of luck and an efficient fight against Algerian and internal troublemakers maybe we will be able to stay afoot? Maybe this won't be the end for us... right?"
nfa.624.a:0 "A national disaster"
