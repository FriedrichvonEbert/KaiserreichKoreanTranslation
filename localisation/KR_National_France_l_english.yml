 POLITICS_JEAN_III_DESC:0 "1874년에 태어난 장 오를레앙은 오랫동안 귀족들의 무관심을 받아왔습니다. 그래서 그는 프랑스 왕가의 왕위 계승 서열에서 한참 멀었습니다. 프랑스군에 복무할 수 없게 된 그는 발데마르 왕자가 7촌(장 3세의 할머니와 발데마르 왕자의 외증조할아버지가 남매 관계)이었기 때문에 덴마크군에 복무했다가, 모로코에 정착해 모로코에서 프랑스의 이익을 증진하려고 했습니다. 대전쟁이 그를 변화시켰을 것입니다. 또 다시 프랑스군에 입대하는 것이 금지되자, 그는 적십자에 가입해 그의 프랑스식 대저택을 병원으로 개조하고 부상자들을 개인적으로 돌봤습니다. 처음에는 정치에 관심이 거의 없었지만, 패배와 혁명의 발발은 그에게 대대적인 개혁의 필요성을 확신시켜 그를 악시옹 프랑세즈에 더 가까워지게 했습니다. 1924년에 사촌 필리프 오를레앙이 후계자 없이 세상을 떠나자, 그는 군주주의자들로부터 프랑스 왕좌의 정당한 권리자로 칭송받았습니다. 독일령 모로코로 망명하면서, 그는 전임자들이 시작한 통합주의자들과 협력을 계속했을 것입니다. 특히 가톨릭이 생디칼리슴 혁명의 교권 개입을 반대하는 폭력에 큰 충격을 받아 이 행동에 무관심했을 때, 군주주의자들의 노력은 전적으로 악시옹 프랑세즈에 집중되었습니다. 1933년, 그는 프랑스를 구하기 위해 \"정당들의 정부\" 대신 \"왕실 정부\"를 요구하는 성명서를 페탱 정권에 발표했습니다. 이는 공화국의 위신이 가장 낮았고 원수의 군사정부가 빠르게 지지를 잃고 있었던 프랑스 망명지에서 그의 정치적 입지를 더 강화해주었을 것입니다.\n\n민주적이고 개혁적인 세력에 대항한 샤를 드 골의 승리와 함께, 새로운 국가원수가 왕정복고를 요구했다는 것에 놀란 사람은 거의 없었습니다. 장 3세는 이제 공화국의 잔재를 제거하려고 애쓰면서 프랑스를 이끌고 있으며, 교회의 맏딸인 프랑스로 하여금 빨갱이들로부터 본국을 수복하기 위한 신성한 투쟁을 준비하고 있습니다."
 POLITICS_HENRI_VI_DESC:0 "1908년에 태어난 젊은 앙리 도를레앙은 평생 동안 망명 생활을 해왔다고 알려져 있습니다. 그는 모로코에 있는 유복한 농장주의 아들로 걱정 없이 유년 시절을 보냈는데, 농장에서는 다양한 일꾼들이 그를 보살펴 주었으며, 프랑스어, 아랍어, 영어, 독일어, 이탈리아어, 스페인어를 모두 유창하게 구사할 수 있었습니다. 그러나 곧 그는 혁명가들의 분노로부터 도망가기 전 그의 아버지와 샤토 로스피탈에서 전쟁의 참상을 겪었습니다. 이 일들은 앙리에게 깊은 트라우마를 안겨주었고 훗날의 정치적 각성을 이룰 씨앗이 되었습니다. 모로코로 돌아간 그는 당대 최고의 석학들에게 통합주의 사상을 배우며, 도덕과 사회 규율의 엄격한 준수, 기업주의 사상에 따른 경제 개혁 등을 옹호하게 되는 데 많은 영향을 미쳤습니다. 벨기에에서 그의 연구를 계속하면서 가톨릭 활동의 일환으로 유럽의 빈곤층이 겪는 끔찍한 주거, 노동 실태를 고발했습니다. 1924년 그의 아버지가 프랑스 왕가의 수장이 되었을 때, 그는 왕세자로 책봉되었고, 그를 신념 있는 왕으로 만들기 위한 조언자들이 그와 함께했습니다. 공화제인 프랑스에서 당장은 금지되어있는 왕가로써, 늠름한 왕세자는 왕당파라는 대의에 입각하여 샤를과의 악연에도 불구하고 악시옹 프랑세즈와 협력하는 자세를 취했습니다. 악시옹 프랑세즈의 발언력 증가가 곧 왕정복고의 가장 빠른 기회였기 때문입니다. 1931년 그의 친척 이사벨 도를레앙 이 브라간사와 결혼했고, 1933년 아들 앙리를 출산하면서 왕당파에서는 왕정복고에 더 큰 추진력이 생겼습니다.\n\n종종 모로코에서 국경을 넘어 샤를 드 골과 같은 왕당파 지도자들을 만나는 신중한 여행을 한 앙리는 왕정복고를 쟁취하는 투쟁에 큰 역할을 했습니다. 새로운 왕국 초기에는 그가 모든 면에서 노쇠한 아버지를 도왔고, 때때로 악시옹 프랑세즈보다 더 권력을 휘두르면서 왕위 이면의 진정한 권력자로 여겨지기도 했습니다. 이제 권력을 잡은 앙리 왕은 프랑스의 재탄생을 시작하여, 앞으로 천 년 동안 지속될 왕국을 건설하기를 고대하고 있습니다."

 NATFRA_Protective_Inequality:0 "불평등 보호"
 NATFRA_Protective_Inequality_desc:0 "The demagogic liberals pretended to make all men equal: this was of course folly. Instead, the State must work towards a repartition of societal roles that is beneficial to all, encouraging traditional and natural structures while preventing any excesses that might foster resentment among the lower classes: not out of a pipe dream of \"equality\", but out of a lucid sense of care for our subjects."
 NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter:0 "교회의 장녀"
 NATFRA_The_Eldest_Daughter_desc:0 "France is the Elder Daughter of the Church, home of countless saints and faithful heroes, defending the Faith at every turn, even blessed with saintly kings like Saint Louis. That is, until the revolution and the 1905 Laws: we must repent for these errors and restore the Church to her rightful position. From godless republic, we will be reborn as a sacramental kingdom."
 NATFRA_Localism:0 "지방주의"
 NATFRA_Localism_desc:0 "We will restore the institutions of the French Kingdom: municipal councils, regional parliaments, professional assemblies, guilds, etc. The Crown will set policy and decide what no one else could, but anything that could be decided on a local level should be so. Furthermore, justice and policing will be handled locally, following local laws and local traditions."
 NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures:0 "지방문화 보호"
 NATFRA_Promote_Regional_Cultures_desc:0 "The République sought to destroy regional cultures and languages, dialects were forbidden for anything official, particularly education, while in the empire little respect was shown to local traditions, seen as oddities soon swept away by so-called \"progress\". But it is the Republic that has been swept away, and so we will follow a policy of promotion of the diversity of France and her people."
 NATFRA_Corporatism:0 "협동조합주의"
 NATFRA_Corporatism_desc:0 "The Social Doctrine of the Church rejects socialism and unrestricted capitalism, and supports workers’ rights to organise. Inspired by this and traditional institutions, our subjects will come together to form corporations, in the spirit of the guilds of old. In the past, the King protected the lower classes, and when they were abandoned, they became slaves of worshippers of Mammon: we say, no more!"
 NATFRA_Clacissism:0 "고전주의"
 NATFRA_Clacissism_desc:0 "The origin of the revolution lies in the Reformation and the Enlightenment: instead, we will foster their opposite, classicism, refining of the genius of the ancient Greeks and Romans through a thoroughly French lens: the stoic sobriety and wisdom of the Ancients will prevent decadence from taking root again in France."
 NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism:0 "의회주의의 끝"
 NATFRA_End_Parliamentarism_desc:0 "The Third Republic was weak, ineffective in times of crisis and incapable of conducting the policies needed for France to maintain her rank among nations. France suffered from a lack of clear direction, her people divided: the king has ended this petty squabble masquerading as democracy, and will lead from now on his subjects towards glory."
 NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel:0 "현실국가"
 NATFRA_Le_Pays_Reel_desc:0 "We are getting ever closer to freeing the \"pays réel\", from its shackles imposed by the \"pays légal\", a few thousand individuals, speaking for millions, more concerned with their little quarrels between mediocre so-called elite. But the real country, once artificially divided, its roots slowly undermined, once fooled by the Geuse, is now united under the king: the damage done since 1789 will be undone."
 NATFRA_Exalt_Aristocracy:0 "귀족 지위 부여"
 NATFRA_Exalt_Aristocracy_desc:0 "The nobility has given us many great heroes who never hesitated to fight for the kingdom and the Faith. Stripped of their privileges and persecuted, many nobles have fallen into passivity, merely keeping the dream of the kingdom alive. This changes now: worthy nobles will be restored to their natural positions and noble and peasant will reform their holy bond to once again take on the Gueuse."
 NATFRA_National_Solidarity:0 "국민연대"
 NATFRA_National_Solidarity_desc:0 "The Reds promote class warfare: though their defence of labour is just, this is deeply contrary to the Faith, pitting brother against brother and ultimately achieving nothing but the destruction of the social fabric. Instead, we will promote national solidarity; thanks to the watchful guidance of our king we will ensure that all acquire a just reward for their labour so that they may be able to live in dignity."
 NATFRA_End_Republican_Demagogy:0 "공화주의 선동의 끝"
 NATFRA_End_Republican_Demagogy_desc:0 "By promising equality, the republicans deeply undermined France. The people, hoping for an unattainable dream, reduced to mere cogs, called to vote so that decisions might be taken far away from them, were easily seduced by the rhetoric of the Communards. Who could blame them? Remaining republicans will atone or we will make sure they are not able to disgrace France any longer."
 NATFRA_Colony_To_Province:0 "From Colony to Province"
 NATFRA_Colony_To_Province_desc:0 "The influence of native elites proved crucial in order to secure power, and they now expect their customary privileges and rights restored. We will oblige: no more will France trample tribal and Islamic law, attempting to transform these men into Frenchmen. Instead, the indigènes will now thrive under the careful watch of these dedicated servants of the empire."

 NATFRA_Crush_the_Anti_France_desc:0 "The Four Confederate Estates, the Anti-France, any good Frenchman knows who is meant by these epithets: Freemasons, Protestants, Jews and Metics.

 NATFRA_Rely_on_Ourselves_desc:0 "Though we know we can count on our allies in our crusade to retake France, our Latin and Catholic brothers, and yes, even the Rosbifs, we must not rely on foreign help. The empire is rich in resources, and populated by millions of proud Frenchmen ready to fight and die for the patrie: we simply need a strong drive for development and technological advancements, and nothing will be able to stop us."

 NATFRA_Take_back_our_Resources_desc:0 "Our African dominion is full of riches. So far privately exploited, we cannot afford to let any inefficiencies get in the way of extracting resources vital to the coming war effort.

 NATFRA_La_Contre_Revolution_desc:0 "The effort to destroy the Gueuse is finally over. But we have never lost sight of our goal: the fires of one revolution have been extinguished, it is now time to extinguish the fires of another. So that France may be whole, so that her people might be free, so that the dynasty might lead us to a brighter future, we will prepare, wait for the opportune moment, and then fight to the bitter end.\nMontjoie Saint-Denis !

 NATFRA_Egoism_of_each_helps_all_desc:0 "Though the king’s influence must be felt throughout society, day to day local decision-making must be done by associations between the individual and the State, freely constituted and ruled by consensus, trade associations or municipal councils. As each strives for their best interests, a mutually beneficial accord will be found, with the Crown acting as an arbitrator to prevent any injustices from taking place."
 NATFRA_Second_Union_Sacree:0 "두 번째 신성한 단결"
 NATFRA_Second_Union_Sacree_desc:0 "After months of political instability, Pétain has fallen and the Republic endures. After his election by the Parliament as president of the French Republic, General Henri Mordacq has chosen to take a step back and let a government of national unity headed by Colonel de La Rocque take charge, hoping for a return to normalcy after years of rule by a military junta."
 NATFRA_the_concentration_republicaine_theory:0 "\"공화집중제\" 이론"
 NATFRA_the_concentration_republicaine_theory_desc:0 "From the very start, the Third Republic was unstable, facing pressure from the reactionary right and revolutionary left, as republicans stood divided. Much like then, Republicans of all stripes must unite and endure, setting aside their differences at least temporarily to make sure the Republic endures in these crucial times."

 NATFRA_reinforce_the_republican_school_system_desc:0 "Originally a product of the more liberal urban upper-middle class, the Republic took generations to truly take root. One of its greatest weapons had been free, mandatory education, educating even the poorest and making sure that all receive republican values. Thanks to the \"Black Hussars of the Republic\", teachers, we will renew trust in our democratic system."
 NATFRA_new_senatorial_elections:0 "신규 상원 선거"
 NATFRA_new_senatorial_elections_desc:0 "Dominated by older, more conservative members of parliaments, elected under pressure by Marshal Pétain, the Senate went only reluctantly with his removal from office and could prove unwieldy to truly heal the Republic. Though it is still too early for national elections, the Senate is elected by the Assembly: an election will make sure that most Pétain appointees lose their seat."
 NATFRA_electoral_reforms:0 "선거제도 개혁"
 NATFRA_electoral_reforms_desc:0 "To ensure the survival of our renewed democracy, electoral reform is needed: parts of Algeria and Senegal have always sent representatives to the parliament, but there simply wouldn't be enough of them as it stands. Districts will be redrawn, the privileges of the Four Communes extended to much of Senegal, and the number of parliamentarians will be brought down."
 NATFRA_parliamentary_suppremacy:0 "의회 지상주의"
 NATFRA_parliamentary_suppremacy_desc:0 "The Fourth Republic was born in chaos, and its new constitutional laws mostly officialised the accepted practices of the Third: that is, parliamentary dominance, the president choosing to stay confined to a largely ceremonial, unifying role. To prevent takeover from strongmen, we will enshrine the supremacy of parliament further."
 NATFRA_le_franc_algerien:0 "알제리 프랑"
 NATFRA_le_franc_algerien_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg the Franc lost much of its value, and the exile made the situation worse as war debts seemed unlikely to be repaid. Thorough monetary reform has been necessary for years, but put off by a Pétain regime hoping for a return to the Franc’s pre-war value. No more: it might prove unpopular, but the Franc will be severely devalued."
 NATFRA_bailout_french_companies:0 "프랑스 기업 구제금융"
 NATFRA_bailout_french_companies_desc:0 "Thanks to heavy investments by the state, many of the companies displaced by the revolution managed to reimplement themselves in Algeria smoothly. However, the recent waves of unrest have made the economic situation volatile: the government has announced that it will bailout companies to prevent further crisis, privately hoping to restore the friendly ties between state and industry enjoyed under the junta."

 NATFRA_attract_investments_from_the_entente_desc:0 "Our allies overseas have supported us through thick and thin, and many see this restoration of democracy as a great omen: with promise of support and advantageous contracts, as well as greater economic cooperation with allied nations, the government will attract further investments from the Entente."
 NATFRA_reinforce_business_ties:0 "사업 관계 강화"
 NATFRA_reinforce_business_ties_desc:0 "Pétain had built a strong network of support among the industrial upper classes, thankful for his support in the exile and more than a little sceptical of parliamentary democracy. We must restore business confidence in the new state of affairs and reach an understanding with the economic elites: the wave of bailouts sent a strong message, new government contracts will hopefully do the rest."
 NATFRA_solidarist_welfare_reforms:0 "사회연대주의자들의 복지 개혁"
 NATFRA_solidarist_welfare_reforms_desc:0 "The Republic must show an open hand, not a closed fist. Theorised by the Radical Léon Bourgeois as a response to both socialism and liberalism, solidarism guided much of the social reforms of the last decades, such as a right to healthcare and insurance, free education, or income tax. We will continue these initiatives, to better the lives of our citizens and prevent unrest."

 NATFRA_republicanization_of_the_army_desc:0 "Though the army played a critical role in the removal of Pétain from office, it is still a hotbed of reaction, as both junta loyalists and monarchists quietly resent the new state of affairs.

 NATFRA_emprunts_de_la_defense_nationale_desc:0 "War is inevitably coming: we must prepare and the people must contribute.

 NATFRA_begin_civilian_mobilization_desc:0 "France has been since the revolution a nation of citizen-soldiers, each man ready to be conscripted, fight for and die for the Republic. It’s time to partially mobilise, now that war is on the horizon. Furthermore, thanks to the Pétain régime, we are well prepared to switch to a war economy: we will begin preparations to fully mobilise civilian industry for the war effort."
 NATFRA_merge_unions_into_the_cspf:0 "BSPF로 노조 통합"
 NATFRA_merge_unions_into_the_cspf_desc:0 "After the exile, socialist unions were banned, and more traditional unions proved ineffective, leading to a lack of representation for workers. As such the government has created a Bureau of French Professional Unions, inspired by the PSF’s own union, and has strongly encouraged unions to merge with the Bureau, something more radical unions were told they had little choice but to agree with."
 NATFRA_secure_labor_agreements:0 "노동 협약 확보"
 NATFRA_secure_labor_agreements_desc:0 "The absorption of the vast majority of unions into the BSPF has led to a large number of renegotiations of local agreements between employers and workers. Indeed, whereas unions had formerly been defanged and isolated by state pressure, they can now count on a large support network and make demands without fearing repression, the Bureau making sure these demands remain reasonable."

 NATFRA_societe_nationale_du_transport_saharien_desc:0 "Reliably crossing the Sahara has long been a dream of the colonial authorities. Travel by sea is time consuming, while air travel is still precarious and not suited to transport large amounts of goods: a land route is necessary, to link Algiers to Dakar, to bring prosperity to the interior. Following in the footsteps of the Estienne brothers, we will develop Saharan infrastructures and make this dream a reality."
 NATFRA_promote_technocratic_management:0 "기술관료적 관리 추진"
 NATFRA_promote_technocratic_management_desc:0 "Too often under the Pétain regime, it was not the worthy who were promoted but the most loyal: this led to tensions and general mediocrity in management, in both the private and public sector.

 NATFRA_work_charter_desc:0 "The BSPF, the government, and representatives from big business have finally reached a national agreement: thanks to promises of important state support and restriction of disruptive union activities, particularly striking, concessions from the industrial elites have been extracted, a new work charter which will be sure to better working conditions and wages for much of our population."
 NATFRA_expand_the_mass_party:0 "대중의 당 확장"
 NATFRA_expand_the_mass_party_desc:0 "The new government is dominated by the French Social Party, a post-exile mass party: instead of catering to the politically-minded middle and upper classes, the party organised in local cells welcomes the masses, coordinating a large amount of activities, ranging from soup kitchens to summer camps. Now in government, the party will grow further and propose even more opportunities for its adherents."
 NATFRA_merge_the_rightist_parties:0 "우파 정당 병합"
 NATFRA_merge_the_rightist_parties_desc:0 "Many minor right wing parties exist, and their efforts often get dispersed in petty factionalism: to work towards the goal of lasting national unity and to ensure that the Republic is well armed to fight both the far left and the AF who still lurks, the PSF will make overtures to both the moderate conservative and mass right parties to merge under the PSF, an initiative strongly encouraged by de La Rocque."

 NATFRA_allow_militarization_of_the_croix_de_feu_desc:0 "The successes of the PSF’s youth wing in creating upright, dynamic youths, has led to a proposal to create a similar organisation on the national level, the Social and Patriotic Youths.

 NATFRA_regularize_relations_with_the_church_desc:0 "The Republic was famously anticlerical, but the war, which created a renewal of popular faith, and Pétain’s regime deepened the ties between Church and State. The fall of the junta created fear of renewed hostility: the government will meet prominent Catholics to reassure them, ensuring they steer away from reaction and know the name of their new benefactor: de La Rocque."

 NATFRA_glorify_the_colonel_desc:0 "Colonel de La Rocque is an exceptional man. A war hero, grievously wounded during the Weltkrieg but choosing to return to the front, he received numerous decorations for his bravery. After the exile, he put his natural proficiency for leadership to good use, first among veteran groups and then in founding the PSF and in government, already bettering the lives of millions. He deserves our admiration."
 NATFRA_cement_the_coalition:0 "연정 결속"
 NATFRA_cement_the_coalition_desc:0 "To the surprise of many, the traditional republican elites and the PSF have managed to work together in relative harmony: the government of national unity, this sacred union, seems well-disposed to last, as the party involved caters to different needs of the new political landscape, mass appeal and traditional republican legitimacy. A new, hybrid system is born."
 NATFRA_neutralize_the_psf:0 "사회당 무력화"
 NATFRA_neutralize_the_psf_desc:0 "The old guard of the Third Republic has managed to outmanoeuvre de La Rocque.

 NATFRA_Principles_of_Strategy_desc:0 "Though creating a rigid set of strategies to be employed in the field would be fully, under the direction of Mordacq will make sure to at the very least codify a number of principles for our officers: stay on the offensive, economise your forces, follow established strategy or take initiatives but not dawdle, and most important follow the new mantra of our armed forces.

 NATFRA_Rebuild_North:0 "북부 재건"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_North_desc:0 "The bulk of the French industry is in the north of the country, on top of its coal and metal mines, and all roads and railroads lead to Paris. Already damaged by the heavy fighting of the Weltkrieg, the recent conflict was certainly not kind either to the region. Our rebuilding efforts must be intensified to ensure France is ready to stand tall as an economic power once again."

 NATFRA_Reorg_Forces:0 "프랑스군 재조직"
 NATFRA_Reorg_Forces_desc:0 "In exile, even with the important contribution of the indigènes, our manpower was strictly limited. Despite such odds, we have triumphed: now that the mainland is reconquered, many Frenchmen are ready to take up arms to fight for the motherland. Some reorganisation will be needed to accommodate them, but soon France will be able to field numerous armies once again."
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Mil_Complex:0 "군사단지 재건"
 NATFRA_Rebuild_Mil_Complex_desc:0 "Much of the industry needed for the war effort was destroyed in the conflict, either through strategic bombing or through sabotage.

 NATFRA_Officer_Amnesty_desc:0 "Not all of the men who served the revolution are irredeemable.

 NATFRA_Special_Forces_desc:0 "The war has proved to us the usefulness of specialised troops, such as paratroopers or marines, in securing limited objectives critical to the success of larger operations, especially when dealing with limited manpower.

 NATFRA_Expand_Bureau:0 "제 2부서 확장"
 NATFRA_Expand_Bureau_desc:0 "Intelligence was critical in the last conflict, as we worked together with loyalists within the Commune to create ideal conditions for the reconquest.

 NATFRA_Nuclear_Science_desc:0 "The Internationale had started developing nuclear research, in the hopes of creating an ultimate, war-ending weapon.

 NATFRA_Verdun_Memorial_desc:0 "The end of the Second Weltkrieg reminded many of the results of the first. Again, millions of people died in the war, villages were razed and the economy was destroyed.

 NATFRA_Franco_German_Trade_desc:0 "It is undeniable that the German Empire is now the dominant power in Europe, both militarily and most importantly economically, despite the recent economic meltdown.

 NATFRA_Congress_of_Verdun_desc:0 "Germany and France have long been rivals: no place is a better representative of this than Verdun, this gate between two great nations where so many fell in 1916. It is also where in 843, France and Germany were first separated by the heirs of Charlemagne. Many diplomats are hoping it could also be where a congress for lasting peace is called, and perhaps where a new Franco-German relationship could be born."

 NATFRA_Pays_Naturels:0 "자연국가 인정"
 NATFRA_Pays_Naturels_desc:0 "In an effort to destroy the true France, the Republicans in their manic obsession with rationality created entirely artificial administrative subdivisions, denying any local identities, dialects and traditions, going as far as imposing the Parisian dialect as \"proper\" French.

 NATFRA_Province_Parliament:0 "지방 의회 복원"
 NATFRA_Province_Parliament_desc:0 "The realm had traditionally been divided between various provinces, each with their own assemblies tasked with administering their area according to local rights and privileges, ensuring that each part of France was ruled in a perfectly tailored way. These provincial parliaments were of course abolished by the Revolution, ending centuries of harmonious autonomy: they will be restored."
 NATFRA_Expand_Camelot:0 "카멜롯 확충"
 NATFRA_Expand_Camelot_desc:0 "The Camelots du Roi, youths originally tasked with selling the Action Française newspaper, have evolved into an intensely loyal paramilitary force.

 NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny:0 "폭정이 아닌 권위"
 NATFRA_Authority_not_Tyranny_desc:0 "Much like subordination is not slavery, authority must not be tyranny.

 NATFRA_Social_Doctrine:0 "Enforce the Social Doctrine"
 NATFRA_Social_Doctrine_desc:0 "The Social Doctrine of the Church is a wide ranging compendium of teachings related to the Common Good of society.

 NATFRA_Blame_et_Accuse_desc:0 "Because of the pathetic elites of the Republic, the war was lost. Then, much like the Germans had encouraged the existence of the Gueuse to weaken France in 1871, they inoculated the nation with the socialist plague during the Great War. They wanted France weak and divided: no more! The king has finally returned, our misled people have awoken, and the Anti-France, republican or syndicalist, has been cast out."

 NATFRA_Restore_Religious_Freedom_desc:0 "The deeply anticlerical leftists sought to break the Church. Though state atheism was too much of a risk for the Communards to take, the faithful were derided and bombarded with propaganda, religious education was banned, and public expression of religion was hardly constrained. No more: though France remains a secular state, this antagonisation of religion will immediately stop."

Clearly, party politics are to blame for much of this, as individuals chose their group interests over what was best for France. Elected officials will no longer affiliate with parties, and instead will have to shine of their own merit."
 NATFRA_Perm_Advisors:0 "비정치적 상임고문"
 NATFRA_Perm_Advisors_desc:0 "Too often, the French governments and lawmakers put in place legislation without knowing the first thing about the topic in question, whether that be industry, science or the economy.

 NATFRA_Electoral_System:0 "간소화된 선거제도"
 NATFRA_Electoral_System_desc:0 "The Republican electoral system was far too prone to being abused by the whims of a people easily whisked into frenzy. To prevent the instability that led to the downfall of France, we will deeply reform it.

 NATFRA_Dismantle_Red_Virus_desc:0 "Like an insidious malady, socialism has spread over the last century in French consciousnesses, from deranged intellectuals, to politicians, to the humblest of labourers.

 NATFRA_Admin_Reorg:0 "행정 조직 개편"
 NATFRA_Admin_Reorg_desc:0 "The pre-war administration was simply a waste. Too many subdivisions, too many bureaucrats, using too many resources and creating too many regulations, which led to increased taxes, less productivity, less production.

 NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms:0 "개혁적 노조 합법화"
 NATFRA_Legitimize_Union_Reforms_desc:0 "Denied reform, workers turned to violence and class warfare in the hope of bettering their conditions, and thus was born the revolution. To prevent such tragedy, dialogue between capital and labour must happen and reform must be possible: unions that officially renounce revolutionary rhetoric will be welcomed back within workplaces, even if they profess some form of socialism."
 NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws:0 "신규 노동법 협상"
 NATFRA_Negotiate_New_Labor_Laws_desc:0 "Under the auspices of the government, labour and capital, as well as representatives from various parties and interest groups, have joined together to discuss reforms to labour laws, often sidestepped in the wake of the syndicalist defeat. Our people can and must be confident in the Republic’s tireless defence of their interests."
 NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty:0 "사형제 폐지"
 NATFRA_Abolish_Death_Penalty_desc:0 "In 1791 already our forefathers had passionate debates relating to the end of capital punishment, and since then our great men, such as Hugo, Gambetta, Clemenceau, Jaurès have tirelessly advocated for the abolition of the death penalty. It is finally time to take this step forward: the bloodlust of the guillotine has been satiated by these decades of fratricidal conflict."
 NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services:0 "공공 서비스 국영화"
 NATFRA_Nationalize_Public_Services_desc:0 "Desyndicalisation has occasionally strayed zealously and aggressively far, in some domains leading to a drop in quality of life of our citizens: to correct this error, some public services will be nationalised, in order to deploy them according to the public interest and not profit."
 NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms:0 "복지 개혁 확대"
 NATFRA_Expand_Welfare_Reforms_desc:0 "Continuing and expanding the solidaristic welfare programs in the vein of the Radical traditions will ensure that our people, still reeling from the war and struggling to rebuild our nation, will still be able to live decently and won’t find themselves falling into nostalgia for the syndicalist regime."
 NATFRA_Protect_Secular_Traditions:0 "세속적 전통 보호"
 NATFRA_Protect_Secular_Traditions_desc:0 "The 1905 laws on the Separation of the Churches and the State enshrined laïcité, strict secularism, as one of the pillars of the French Republic. This document, widely decried but ultimately born out of a spirit of conciliation, will be restored, ensuring that neither religious obscurantism nor far-left anticlericalism prevents the Republic from moving forward."
 NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos:0 "디스포 해산"
 NATFRA_Disband_the_Dispos_desc:0 "The PSF’s security service, the \"Dispos\" have teetered on the brink of paramilitarism for too long: they have had their use in defending our fledgeling reborn democracy, but we cannot tolerate that private citizens attempt to bypass legitimate law enforcement to maintain order. We will contact de La Rocque so that they can be quietly disbanded."
 NATFRA_Reinstitute_Republican_School:0 "공화주의적 학교 재도입"
 NATFRA_Reinstitute_Republican_School_desc:0 "When the Republic was still young and fragile, it’s mandatory, free education that solidified her position and conquered the hearts and minds of the French nation to Republican values and ideals. The Republic might be triumphant now, but much remains to be done to heal the scars of the last decades, and once again schools will be a critical battleground of ideas."
 NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech:0 "언론의 자유 보장"
 NATFRA_Enshrine_Freedom_of_Speech_desc:0 "One of the fundamental rights outlined by the 1789 Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen was freedom of speech. Since then, this right has often been contested: both Communard authorities and the Pétain junta made liberal use of censorship, but no more! Freedom of speech shall be exalted as one of the pillars of the Republic."
 NATFRA_Reorganize_the_Departments:0 "부서 재편성"
 NATFRA_Reorganize_the_Departments_desc:0 "The Commune had abolished the departments, the base administrative division of France. Designed to destroy feudal and cultural boundaries in 1789, they were decried as bourgeois, a remnant of the tyranny of so-called Reason. This abolition fostered regionalist sentiment: they will be restored, for a better, more efficient administration of France One and Indivisible, without caving to petty localisms."
 NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism:0 "지역주의와의 싸움"
 NATFRA_Fight_Regionalism_desc:0 "The federal nature of the Commune has emboldened regionalists, and some are openly asking for autonomy for their regions, particularly in Brittany and even in Corsica. Every inch given to these groups is one closer to separatism. Thankfully France has moved past such remnants of the past, she is One and Indivisible!"
 NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations:0 "교회 관계 정상화"
 NATFRA_Normalize_Church_Relations_desc:0 "Relations between the Catholic Church and the Republic have been tense, to say the least, and since 1905 separation of Church and State official diplomatic relations had broken down. However, the Weltkrieg and our common opposition to the Commune has brought us closer, and we must now seek appeased relations with the Holy See."
 NATFRA_Combat_Polarization:0 "양극화와의 전투"
 NATFRA_Combat_Polarization_desc:0 "Crypto-Communards to the left, reactionaries to the right, here we are in the centre and we must stick together to prevent either kind of despotism from toppling the Republic once again. Politics must not be allowed to fall back into violent rhetoric and irreconcilable oppositions: the name of the game is compromise and unity against radicals."
 NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness:0 "민영화 광란"
 NATFRA_Privatisation_Madness_desc:0 "So much was seized and collectivised by the Commune that there is no way that a functional economy could be rebuilt if we just accepted the status quo: mass privatisation must continue to help France recreate a market economy."
 NATFRA_Create_New_Elite:0 "새로운 엘리트 후원자 생성"
 NATFRA_Create_New_Elite_desc:0 "Much of the old industrial elites had compromised themselves by throwing themselves at the feet of the military junta, and some whispers that they had plans of outright taking over the state apparatus. Frankly, they can’t be trusted. Through the strategic use of government contracts and investments, we will make sure that the right kind of Republican patriots succeeds in the future."
 NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie:0 "헌병대 확충"
 NATFRA_Expand_Gendarmerie_desc:0 "The Gendarmerie must be expanded and reinforced to enforce order on the rural areas of France, still occasionally plagued by Communard remnants and where the devastation of the war and decollectivisation has left many in difficult situations, with some turning to crime and the Black Market."
 NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists:0 "공화-사회주의자 불명예화"
 NATFRA_Discredit_Radical_Socialists_desc:0 "The left-wing of the Radicals, who had thrown their lot in with the Revolution, before being marginalised by more radical socialist elements, are attempting to come crawling back to the Republic: we mustn't let traitors and crypto-Syndicalists infiltrate the halls of power."
 NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers:0 "대통령 권력 강화"
 NATFRA_Reinforce_Presidential_Powers_desc:0 "The Third Republic was notoriously unstable: we cannot make the same mistakes as our predecessors, some sort of check on parliamentary power is needed. The president of the Republic must play a unifying role instead of being confined to a purely ceremonial power."
 NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare:0 "가톨릭 사회 복지"
 NATFRA_Social_Catholic_Welfare_desc:0 "According to the social teachings of the Church, Christian solidarity requires that the state protects the dignity and well-being of our fellow man. As such, extensive welfare reform must take place, and private charity efforts will be strongly encouraged and subsidised."
 NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists:0 "기독교 지역주의자 통합"
 NATFRA_Integrate_Christian_Regionalists_desc:0 "The Church demands subsidiarity, that is to say, that political decisions should be taken at the local level whenever possible, and the centralising urge of the Republic is rather Jacobin in nature. It is only just to welcome those who desire to protect their local traditions, particularly their attachment to the Faith. France is One, but denying her local particularities is foolish."
 NATFRA_Christian_Unions:0 "기독교 노동조합"
 NATFRA_Christian_Unions_desc:0 "Pope Leo XIII outlined in the encyclical Rerum Novarum the mutual duties and rights of capital and labour: among these is the right to unionise, and since then faithful Catholic workers have come together to defend their rights in faith-minded unions. These must be heavily promoted, to counterbalance any kind of remnant of socialist rhetoric among the working class."
 NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures:0 "지방 행정 구역 수립"
 NATFRA_Establish_Regional_Prefectures_desc:0 "The prefects and sub-prefects are the direct representatives of the state at the local level, with many responsibilities such as law enforcement. They are meant to be neutral checks on elected local authorities, freely nominated by the government. To prevent any future risk of instability, their powers will be extended and their total loyalty to the Republic ensured."
 NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes:0 "교회 교구 복원"
 NATFRA_Restore_Churches_And_Parishes_desc:0 "Though the Commune was not an explicitly atheistic state, it was certainly ferociously anticlerical, and many of our churches have suffered from lack of resources, if not from hostile acts, and war. We will embark on a large-scale restoration effort, providing work and an opportunity to expiate the errors of the past for many."
 NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws:0 "신성모독법"
 NATFRA_Blasphemy_Laws_desc:0 "With a new Concordat in place, blasphemy laws will follow. Freedom of speech is, of course, an undeniable right, but freedom ends where the rights of others start: an offence against the religion of the majority of Frenchmen cannot be tolerated, especially as freedom of religion was so often abused by Communards acting under the mask of secularism."
 NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat:0 "새 협약 서명"
 NATFRA_Sign_A_New_Concordat_desc:0 "The 1905 Laws of Separation of Churches and State were a tragedy engineered by radicals: denying the Catholic nature of France is simply a denial of reality and a deep injustice. A new Concordat will be agreed to with the Holy See, and France once again will proudly deserve her title of Eldest Daughter of the Church, a first step to restoring the place of the Faith in our nation."
 NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree:0 "법령에 의한 통치"
 NATFRA_Rule_By_Decree_desc:0 "To counter the revolutionary threat, an efficient government is needed. The new military junta under Colonel de La Rocque will not bother itself with the pageantry of parliamentary democracy: until order and stability are assured, decisions will be taken and applied by the Colonel, on the advice of patriotic experts in their fields."
 NATFRA_Privatisations_For_Loyalty:0 "충성을 위한 민영화"
 NATFRA_Privatisations_For_Loyalty_desc:0 "To rebuild a functional market economy, privatisation is needed. But to ensure that the best men reap the profits of the renewed greatness of the French nation, it is patriots, loyal to France and the Colonel, that will be prioritised in the sale of formerly public assets."
 NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists:0 "유사 생디칼리스트들 사냥"
 NATFRA_Hunt_Down_Crypto_Syndicalists_desc:0 "Thorough purges of syndicalist elements have already taken place, but among newly professed loyalists the Republic hides many crypto-socialists, waiting for the right opportunity to strike again. Radical-socialists, \"reformist\" unionists, pardoned officers, they will all be investigated and interrogated. Socialism will not be allowed to attack the French nation again."
 NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role:0 "기술자의 사회적 역할"
 NATFRA_Social_Engineer_Role_desc:0 "The engineer is both a skilled technician and worker, and as such is the perfect link between the popular classes and capital. Engineers must add to their professional and technical skills a deep understanding of our institutions promoting class cooperation so that peace in the workplace can be guaranteed by patriots conscious of the importance of their duty to France."
 NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies:0 "협동조합주의 정책 확장"
 NATFRA_Expand_Corporatist_Policies_desc:0 "France fell because of class conflict because neither capital nor workers respected their mutual duties to each other because they focused on ultimately petty issues of profit instead of their much greater mission: their duty towards their patrie. The government will ensure that these errors will not be repeated, and that class tensions are subjugated by Catholic brotherhood and love for France."
 NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System:0 "애국적 기술학교제도"
 NATFRA_Patriotic_Technical_School_System_desc:0 "The youths of France are distraught, lost in a new world: a system of patriotic technical schools will be created, for them to learn the practical skills that will be demanded of them in the workforce, as well as through apprenticeship and hands-on experience. From the lost children of the syndicalist cause, we will create a generation of workers proudly helping to rebuild the motherland."
 NATFRA_A_Social_Republic:0 "사회 공화국"
 NATFRA_A_Social_Republic_desc:0 "The Republic must be a loving, caring mother to her children and ensure to them all safety, well-being, healthcare, access to education, and a right to work. The syndicalist revolution was brought on by the terrible conditions of the working masses, leading France down towards a dark path out of desperation: the reborn Republic will not make the mistakes that tore her apart again."
 NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic:0 "자유 공화국"
 NATFRA_A_Liberal_Republic_desc:0 "The Republic must be an impartial mother to her children, offering them all manners of freedom and liberty regardless of personal circumstances. Against all odds, the liberal ideals of the Third Republic have been kept alive despite anarchy and tyranny: the Republic reborn brandishes the torch of Liberty and once again shines bright, a true example to all lovers of Reason."
 NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic:0 "가톨릭 공화국"
 NATFRA_A_Catholic_Republic_desc:0 "In 1892, Pope Leo XIII had called on French Catholics to accept the Republic, to take France back from anti-Catholic forces. Despite unceasing persecution from liberals to socialists, the faithful have worked tirelessly, and half a century later, it has been done. Through our efforts, the French Republic has finally been baptised and never again will anyone question the piety of the Eldest Daughter."
 NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic:0 "강력한 공화국"
 NATFRA_A_Strong_Republic_desc:0 "The Third Republic fell because of its chaotic nature. This error led to defeat and exile: our reborn Republic will not allow the foolishness of the past to be repeated. Thanks to the leadership of the Colonel, under whom we are all united, France will rise again, her children united in a common purpose, the restoration of her glory.\nUnité!"
 NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic:0 "제4공화국 선포"
 NATFRA_Proclaim_Fourth_Republic_desc:0 "To refound the Republic on stronger foundations, leaving the past truly behind, a new constitution has been drafted. It will enshrine our recent reforms and lead the Republic towards a renewed age of prosperity and prestige.\n\nLiberté! Egalité! Fraternité! Vive la France!"
 NATFRA_Social_D_abord:0 "사회 우선"
 NATFRA_Social_D_abord_desc:0 "Colonel de La Rocque has led France through her darkest hour and will lead for the foreseeable future, to profoundly reforge the Republic and ensure that the tragedy that has torn apart our nation for the last decades never occurs again. Our people finally reunited will not let itself be divided again by the enemies of France.\nVive le Colonel! Vive la France!"

While the tactical and strategic reforms proposed in this essay by de Gaulle have been acclaimed by officers, it is the larger societal reform some see the Rooster hint at in his work that struck a chord for many in the armed forces, from the simple infantryman to the Lion of Verdun himself, and among civilians, particularly veterans: all those sacrifices, so much bloodshed, so many lives lost, how could they have not been enough to beat back the Boches? The issue must lie primarily elsewhere, in the government, too weak to impose its will upon the armed forces and far too willing to let them fall into fatal discord. Perhaps a stronger, more moral civilian power is needed.\n\nIn any case, de Gaulle, already a celebrated war hero and influential officer, is quickly becoming an even more popular figure, as many of those touched by his call to reform feel he is the perfect example a new generation of officers must aspire to be like, while some see in him the perfect man to help carry out those larger reforms, though the lieutenant-colonel himself is quick to defer any praise towards his \"mentor\", Philippe Pétain."

As such, as Marshal Pétain seeks increased support from diverse powerful groups in his struggle with Mordacq’s partisans, he has found particular luck with the industrial upper classes, both grateful for the support that gave them the opportunity to strive after exile and deeply ideologically committed to the regime, believing a strong hand is needed to guide France towards salvation. However, to prevent these elites from being tempted by the more democratic forces within the République, many of Pétain’s advisors are suggesting a campaign of increased support and strategic investments: not only would this develop the nation’s economy and war capabilities even further, but by choosing carefully those who would benefit from these investments, for example both loyal supporters of the regime and those still tempted by Mordacq's rhetoric, the Lion’s grip on power could be restored, maybe even increased."

As such, the president’s advisors have put together a plan to silence rumours of any wrongdoing: a large scale anti-corruption drive, at all levels of society. By making corruption an even more serious offence, encouraging denunciation of even the slightest hint of it and more generally enforcing a renewed moral order within the administration and public services, the government hopes that the public will turn a blind eye to Pétain’s recent promises of support and investment to various groups, individuals and industries.\n\nHowever, a fair amount of resources will be needed to fuel this drive, and though this plan could help Philippe Pétain maintain power some in the government argue that these resources could be better used to try to find even more support for the regime, while others argue that these measures could alienate parts of the administration."

 nfa.35.d:0 "As the full scale of the deeply rooted corruption plaguing the Pétain government had been revealed over the last few weeks in the press, disbelief was quickly replaced by anger and protests in the streets calling for the president’s resignation grew in size with each passing day. The Marshal, either unwilling or unable to take any radical action to protect his regime had stayed oddly silent, holed up in the presidential Summer Palace in the heights of Algiers as unrest flared up all around him, his support among both the people and the elites he had tried so hard to rally quickly withering. All could see the writing on the wall, his rule could not last much longer, there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to sell out the country to hold on to power, was left.\n\nToday, what all were expecting finally happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of protests instead seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarters of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. In a short radio speech, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relating to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the shady dealings revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with tense applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial."

Coincidentally present in the building, General Mordacq immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio, promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, promising new elections in the near future and eventually a new constitution. Despite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters hope for radical reform and a more democratic future.

Passion for truth, passion for justice, and passion for our country. I therefore ask the public to remember that, while we are prosecuting a defendant today, History will judge the judges themselves one day.\"\n\nWith these words, the president of the High Court opened the first hearing of a long trial to prosecute Pétain, accused of corruption, treason and conspiracy against the République. Determined to defend his honour, Marshal Pétain prepared both his defence and his memoirs from his cell in the Casbah of Algiers, only allowed visits by his wife and his lawyer. Appearing in court in full uniform, after a short statement on the first day of his trial asserting that all of his actions as president had been taken in the interest of the salvation of France and that he was only responsible in front of the French people and not the High Court, the former president stayed silent as witnesses after witnesses corroborated the accusations lobbied against him. After weeks of passionate debate, the sentence has finally been given: death. At this verdict, the Marshal who had stayed so stoic briefly showed weakness, lost his composure, briefly the Lion of Verdun turned into Philippe Pétain, a tired old man of more than 80 years of age.\n\nPublic opinion is incredibly divided, but it seems that if most wanted the Marshal gone from power, the majority thinks any sentence would be going too far, let alone the death penalty. Wanting to avoid making this trial too overtly partisan, Henri Mordacq has thus far stayed silent, however as president it is within his power to commute Pétain’s sentence. What should the Bear do?"

Nevertheless, their support and expertise has proved invaluable for the regime and Pétain has met repeatedly with representatives from the organisation, taking some of its members as special advisors to help him navigate the crisis currently unfolding and the ideas of the Redressement Français will no doubt have a tremendous amount of influence in the decisions taken by the Marshal going forward."

The democratic camp still exists, but it has been severely weakened by media attacks and backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans, its support base greatly eroded by the government’s promises of reform. It’s rumoured that Mordacq himself has struck a deal with the government. Many thought this would be the end of his regime, and yet Philippe Pétain emerges from this crisis stronger than ever: The Bear’s faction is no longer a threat, and the people once again have put their trust in the Lion of Verdun. While the Marshal has had a strong grip on politics since the revolution, it seems that now nothing can stop him from truly reforming the republic according to his wishes.\n\nOr, some whisper, according to the Redressement Français’ wishes. Its help proved decisive: on an ideological level, as many of the reforms proposed by Pétain are lifted straight from their ideas, and on the material level, the Renewal having turned itself into the propaganda arm of the government during the crisis, funding and organising its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime’s stabilisation came in large part thanks to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think tank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and, more importantly, with Pétain’s trust and gratitude. They will no doubt have a large influence shaping the future of the République, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group’s writings. In any case, now that the crisis is over the entire nation’s attention is turned towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. The people now fully united behind Marshal Pétain, finally free from petty divisions, is ready to save the Patrie."

Everything had been carefully studied, the plans of the building had been analysed to ensure that the General could leave him alive, but he knew that there was no such thing as zero risk. He took a picture of himself with his wife and children out of his pocket, and put it back in his pocket a few seconds later, praying that the driver would not have seen anything.\nOnce he arrived in front of the HQ, Lelong got out of the vehicle, head held high, well aware that he could no longer reverse...\n\nArriving late in front of the building, he apologised to the officers who were guarding him, then went to join the meeting.

As adrenaline flowed through his body, he ran to the meeting room, picking up a fallen soldier's rifle as he passed by one of the doors that had previously been guarded before the explosion. The door fell with a simple touch, and Lelong saw Pétain covered with blood but with wide open eyes and at his side de Gaulle. Panicked and determined to complete the mission, Lelong fired two bullets into the Marshal's chest, and a third went to lodge in the General's head beside him. Both collapsed to the ground, covered in blood. Lelong then threw his weapon away, and ran back to the toilet before speeding out through the window overlooking the back of the building.

Immediately transferred to a secret location near Algiers, news of his arrest was triumphantly spread by the government to the media, feeding them a colourful story of the fool Mordacq conspiring with Communards agents to take down the Pétain government and invite the Reds in. While it’s undeniable that some supporters of Mordacq had ties to the more left wing pre-war parties and some of those arrested have confessed under strong interrogation techniques to be on the Commune’s payroll, the evidence of such collusion is light at best. Despite being offered a generous deal in exchange for his confession, Mordacq himself so far refuses to admit doing anything wrong. Surprisingly, many are openly doubting the official story. Arresting such a popular war hero is not going well even among strong supporters of the regime, particularly veterans who remember very well the heroic defence of Arras, and even within the army many who would have been at worst apathetic with repressing the democratic movement are now outraged that the government would go so far.\n\nIn any case, what Pétain feared happened: Henri Mordacq is now a martyr. Open contestation from the army is unprecedented, and many within the government are starting to panic and advise a balanced approach: doubling down on the repression, going after those now protesting against Mordacq’s arrest, while at the same time pulling back somewhat, transfer Mordacq out of hiding, and give him a public trial."

Wanting to stay discreet, the escort had been kept to a minimum and was swiftly dealt with, those attempting to resist shot dead, Mordacq escorted to a car and the convoy set on fire all in the span of less than five minutes. Survivors of the attack describe the prisoner as being just as surprised as his escort that this was happening, but clearly someone coordinated this attack from the inside: not only was this transfer supposed to be a secret to even most of the government, but a fake itinerary had been disseminated by intelligence agents and a decoy convoy had been organised. Whoever leaked the information must have been either very well connected, or is very high up in the chain of command. An investigation has of course been launched and all police are on high alert, but while the violence of Mordacq’s partisans has earned the regime some sympathy, this spectacular evasion has thrown the government in total panic: not only this shows to the eyes of the world that the regime is losing control, but it shows our people that the democratic movement has very influential friends. In any case, the few advisers still advocating for moderation when dealing with the democratic camp have been thoroughly disgraced with some even under heavy suspicion of being Mordacq sympathisers and those advocating for harsher repression now have the Marshal’s ear."

However, this treatment was reserved for civilians, as the government and intelligence services were careful to preserve the reputation of the armed forces, dissenters generally being simply sent on assignment in the middle of the Sahara where their concerns wouldn’t bother anyone. However, with Mordacq’s arrest shocking many, it’s been decided that the large amount of information collected over the years by the intelligence services on soldiers and officers alike would be put to good use. The latest victim of such attempted blackmail is admiral Lucien Lacaze, a known supporter of Mordacq and well liked, successful, and above all morally irreproachable officer.

Admiral Lacaze has been made into a new martyr for the democratic camp, and though he retired in the wake of the scandal, it seems he is now in direct contact with Mordacq's partisans. Although this drastically hinders our plans to deal with dissent among the armed forces with some subtlety, there are far more worrying things: not only we have lost whatever trust officers still put in the regime, but the leaflets currently spreading like wildfire contain confidential documents concerning the fabrication of the various scandals, implicating in this defamation campaign high ranking officers as well many within the administration and in the government. There is only one possible conclusion: there is a mole among us and we need to catch her to prevent more leaks."

While our forces were supposed to suppress any protest, many police and military officers are confused by this unusual situation and decided to simply stand aside to avoid fighting their comrades and friends. Many civilians are watching this protest out of curiosity, and it is now obvious for everyone that Pétain’s rule is far from being popular even within the armed forces, traditionally the one place where the regime was most secure. Since protests are banned for active duty soldiers, the official version of events is that those officers are simply \"parading\", a term that most opposition journals, underground or miraculously still being openly published, are now using ironically to designate these protests. The \"Parades\" have been going on for days now, and it is time we choose how to deal with the situation. In the meantime; the 2nd Bureau is still investigating to find the mole that created this ridiculous situation in the first place."

In any case, the number of protesters is increasing each day, and our forces still refuse to take any active action against them, at best barring access to the way to the presidential palace and other important government buildings, with discrete but numerous gestures of solidarity between the two. The most radical forces within the regime believe it would be better to act immediately and that it might already be too late to stop Mordacq, still on the run."

All were expecting the Marshal to strike, many were ready to die in the streets, and yet, Pétain did nothing. If this was done hoping the people would calm down, it was foolish as there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to brutalise his people to hold on to power was left."

In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of parades instead joined the protests led by Mordacq himself and seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarter of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. Even if Pétain had tried to strike, this was in fact doomed from the start: most the 2nd Bureau, the secret services, was compromised and cooperating with the Bear’s partisans, the \"leaks\" were entirely purposeful. In a short radio speech, the first since his arrest and subsequent escape, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq and freshly freed from jail, rose to deliver an improvised speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his tyrannical regime, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the suspended Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the numerous grievous crimes revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with thunderous applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still foolishly loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial, held in the same high security cell that had been prepared for Henri Mordacq."

While there is no constitutional provision for the creation of such a committee, there is historical precedent, and the Chamber of Deputies is, after all, the sovereign authority in the Republic and can distribute power as it sees fit. While some deputies abstained, the majority voted in favour of the proposal and no name other than that of General Henri Mordacq, hero of the struggle against the tyrannical Pétain, was proposed to head the committee, an eagerness possibly helped by the presence of soldiers loyal to the Bear guarding all exits of the room. Present in the building, the General immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, new elections once the situation stabilises and eventually the redaction of a new constitution.\n\nDespite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters are finally able to show themselves after months of repression. Despite Pétain’s best efforts, a new dawn is rising on the French Republic and the Bear’s promised reforms can only strengthen the country for the war that is inevitably coming."

 nfa.52.d:0 "As the crisis unfolds, it’s quickly becoming obvious that the regime has lost most of its base of support. Veterans are shocked by the actions of the man they have revered for so long, and La Grande Muette is making herself heard loud and clear: she is outraged by the government’s repression. The government desperately needs allies, and it seems at least one group in part might be interested in such a partnership: the royalist Action Française. Indeed, today Charles de Gaulle came to discuss privately with Marshal Pétain about a potential alliance of circumstances. The Rooster seems to have taken upon himself to act as link between his mentor and the party he has never hidden sympathies for and though the national integralists have been consistently and brazenly opposed to the République, considering Pétain’s regime as barely a step up from the weak pre-war government, they share a common trait: distrust for parliamentary democracy and the liberal parties whose rule led to the fall of France in the first place.\n\nAs such, the Action Française is suggesting unofficial cooperation with the regime, at least until the crisis is over, a partnership that could prove salutatory for the Lion and his government. As an old, very well established party the French Action has many sympathisers among both the upper and lower classes, within the Church, the army and even enjoys some popularity with the native population, drawn in by promises of decentralisation and respect of local customs. Its daily newspaper is among the most widely read in the nation, and the party controls a network of \"newspaper vendors\", the Camelots du Roi, the King's Camelots, a security service made up of youngsters and students that some describe as a paramilitary force, used to street brawls and crowd control. Finally, some of the more radical members of the AF have hinted at being willing to use every tool at their disposal to take more \"direct action\" against the democratic camp. All of this could be used to serve the regime and finally end the crisis once and for all.\n\nHowever this partnership could alienate the last few loyal partisans of Pétain, and there is no doubt that the services of the AF would come at the cost of compromise with them down the road. But the regime might simply not survive the next few weeks if we don’t take this deal."

It would seem like the regime can breathe a great sigh of relief, as Mordacq's movement is now far less ascendant.\n\nHowever, part of the loss of ground for the democratic camp is due to the brutal tactics of the more radical elements of the French Action, who have organised themselves in a highly structured, secretive and independent group to take direct action against the Bear’s supporters, with little to no oversight by the party and none from the government. Intimidation, assassination, and even bombings, in the last few weeks it seems nothing is too far for them to take down the democratic camp. Nicknamed the Organisation des Quatre Cents Coups, the Four Hundreds Blows Organisation or less literally, Organisation to Raise Hell, it’s impossible to deny that they have been incredibly effective in suppressing our opponents but the Lion himself is quietly horrified by the terroristic nature of the group."

Nevertheless, their resources, expertise and extensive links to the elites could prove to be salvation for the regime, whatever is left of it. Asking the Marshal to form a new government filled with members of the organisation and essentially a free hand to reform the country according to their ideals, in exchange they promise that they will do everything in their power to end the crisis.

Marshal Pétain’s gamble to hold on to power had almost failed, but when all seemed lost the Redressement Français’ precious help saved the day. The group managed to first thoroughly secure to support of the upper classes, anxious over the crisis unfolding, and create a media offensive putting all the blame of the recent repressive and abusive decisions of the regime on sycophants taking advantage of the elderly Marshal, many of whom have already been arrested on treason and corruption charges, a lie that many in the nation are more than happy to believe, civilians, veterans, soldiers and officers alike. The democratic camp still very much exists, but through backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans and promises of reform, its support is rapidly eroding. The parades are still a daily event, but they are rapidly shrinking in size and it’s rumoured that Mordacq himself is striking a deal with the government, with talks of total amnesty for his partisans and a comfortable retirement for himself.\n\nThough he is still of course the head of state, the political genius Pétain is long gone: only a tired old man rapidly distancing himself from day to day rule is left and some whisper he has merely become a figurehead for the Redressement Français. All the reforms proposed by the government are lifted straight from their ideas, and the Renewal has turned itself into the propaganda arm of the regime, organising and funding its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime’s stabilisation is entirely due to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think thank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group’s writings. In any case, now that the crisis is dying down the entire nation’s attention is once again turning towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. Uniting behind the figure of the Lion of Verdun, the people will soon be ready to save the patrie, and the French Renewal has a free rein to reform the nation so that she is capable to do so."

One day some soldiers had brought their service weapons, pretexting a need for self-defence, the next the Camelots themselves were armed and in reaction to this both police and military deployed to maintain order brought out heavier weaponry. Furthermore, while the violence against Mordacq’s partisans had intimidated many, it also brought them much sympathy from the general public and as such more and more civilians took part in the parades. What had started as a rather absurd display of anger by the Grande Muette was now a daily tense standoff from sunrise to sundown, with occasional brawls between protesters and camelots. Miraculously, despite the numerous injuries sustained in the daily brawls, no deaths had occurred at the parades.\n\nThat is, until today. As one of the usual fights broke out between protesters and camelots, a shot rang out, followed by a cry of pain. No one knows who fired it or where it came from, but after a split second of shocked silence, there was chaos. More and more gunshots came from each side, and with each one protesters, camelots, police and military fell to the ground, some wounded, some dead. Initially overwhelmed, the regime forces quickly regained their composure, the sight of their dead comrades shedding any feelings of hesitation they might have had towards fighting against fellow soldiers. Things quickly turned to street to street fighting, with barricades being hastily constructed by protesters engaging in what could only be described as a fighting retreat: most of them being active duty soldiers or veterans, there was certainly confusion, but no panic. Though they have been pushed back to the littoral, the protesters remain in firm control of much of center of Algiers as the government forces await further orders."

Talks with the protesters had gone nowhere, and the lack of central leadership among them would make any consensus impossible anyway. A tense silence had fallen on the conference room in the presidential palace, broken only by the sound of the occasional gunshots. Then, news came: the protesters have seized heavy machine guns, and chosen to fall back further and fortify a large plaza where a field hospital had been set up. Any assault would be extremely costly, and everyone in the room knew it. And then, quietly, almost a whisper:\n\n\"... shell them\".\n\nA young navy officer had broken the silence. He continued: \"We could shell them. The Liberté class dreadnought Démocratie is anchored a few miles from Algiers, if we wait until nightfall and order her to shell the plaza, it would create enough confusion to storm the camp while minimising damage to the city and losses for our forces. They’re expecting an assault from land, certainly not from the sea\". After a few seconds of silence, the Lion of Verdun angrily stood up, but before he could speak Charles de Gaulle, the Rooster, intervened: \"I’m afraid we have no choice here. If we let the situation fester, we could wake up tomorrow morning to a general insurrection: we must nip this revolution in the bud and act fast. I’m sorry Marshal but now is the time of action, not debate.\".\n\nAnd so, as Philippe Pétain fell silent, the order was given."

Tales of mangled bodies, of brutal treatment of prisoners, of summary executions are being spread by communard agents, but our nation knows the truth: the next morning, the front page of all newspapers read: \"Attempted Coup Bravely Defeated\". The threat posed by these red traitors has finally been dealt with: the few remaining so-called democrats are now either in custody, awaiting trial for their crimes, in hiding, though they will be found sooner or later, or they lie dead in a mass grave slowly filling up as the plaza is being cleaned up. Henri Mordacq, or what was left of his body, was found and identified by his uniform: the Bear himself is dead and we can now breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nMarshal Pétain is however deeply affected by what happened and has not left the presidential palace since, refusing to see anyone other than his wife and his confessor, only occasionally wandering outside of his quarters, mumbling to himself. As such, Charles de Gaulle has unofficially stepped in to help run governmental affairs for the time being: after all, who better than the Lion’s protégé to make sure things go smoothly in these critical times? Having been promoted to the rank of general for his bravery and skill dealing with the crisis, France’s stability is now the utmost priority of the Rooster, and as such he has launched a new large scale investigation to find and bring to justice any and all of those who might have been involved in this attempted coup.

Overzealous camelots have been targeting the family and friends of those on trial, as well as more generally all and any open republicans, with harassment and rapidly escalating violence. Yesterday, it was jeers and insults, today, beatings and property damage, but with the police rarely intervening, who knows where it will stop. The population, taken in the frenzy and wanting to make those responsible for France’s suffering pay has started joining as well, often collectively proving more violent against the perceived enemies of the patrie than the most committed of the camelots. Some are fleeing, others hope the collective wrath will simply pass, though it is quickly becoming uncontrollable. The political disagreements of yesterday have turned into blind rage, and some are even taking advantage of the general frenzy to settle personal feuds, either joining the mob and influencing it into going after personal enemies, or denouncing as liberals, as Mordacq-sympathiser, as republicans whoever slighted them. However, this orgy of violence could prove cathartic for our people, as they can finally rest easy knowing the enemy within will no longer hinder.

However, many of those reforms were already controversial atop the chain of command, and now that they are being implemented, they have put some within the armed forces on high alert regarding the next moves of General Mordacq. Furthermore, the call for deep reform by the new head of state is seen by many civilians as a prelude to the restoration of democratic life, though Mordacq has so far not challenged the state of emergency that has held France in democratic limbo for the last decade. The simmering hope has reached the ranks of the military, among which many already anxious at the prospect of the military reforms are at best sceptical of an eventual return to parliamentary democracy as war looms ever closer. A worry that their fellow reactionary officers have been quick to exploit, convincing some former Pétain loyalists that Mordacq was a poor choice over the much more conservative de Gaulle.\n\nIn any case, this barrack gossip is unlikely to have deeper consequences, Mordacq is a respected theorist and war hero, and the appointed successor of the Lion of Verdun. We could, however, contact the old Marshal, and ask him to briefly come out of retirement for a speech addressed to the troops not so subtly calling for more unity within the ranks."

Each and every one of them listened intently to the man who so recently still dominated the life of the nation, from the humblest of infantrymen to the most decorated officers present. They all heard loud and clear the message the Marshal was methodically laying out. Taking the tone of a disappointed grandfather, he compared the current situation of France to a lengthy trek across the hostile desert, where every resource is precious but the most important thing is cohesion within the group, for men to trust and rely on each other so that they may reach their destination. He strongly praised his successor and reaffirmed his trust in Mordacq’s ability and deeply reform the nation and her armed forces, before announcing that he would fully retire from public life, an announcement that ushered a wave of shock and whispers across the room.

As such, the Deuxième Bureau has taken over the investigation, believing that this is the work of forces opposed to the regime. The democratic press has not waited for confirmation, however, and already calls the man a victim of the Action Française. The royalist newspaper, on the other hand, is all but celebrating the news, being quick to point out that the man’s purpose in the seedy area remains unknown, peddling theories to besmirch the memory of the officer, ranging from a visit to the Casbah’s brothels to ominous conspiracy with supposed Communard agents."

As such, the various parties still exist, with a presidential coalition and an opposition publicly debating, though no one in the République is foolish enough to believe they hold any kind of real power. However, emboldened by the election of Henri Mordacq that they perceive as a friend to the cause of democracy, the long slumbering political parties have finally awakened. Though they would never dare publicly denounce the regime that they have dutifully supported since the exile, representatives from the main parties asked for a discrete private meeting with the Bear.\n\nThere, they explained their concerns to General Mordacq. While some among them spoke of the ideals of the Republic, of the moral duty to restore democracy, most had reached a much more practical conclusion: the people are losing trust in the regime, and its future seems bleak. For now, the popular hope for reform has focused around Mordacq. Despite his calls for deep reform, he remains largely politically aligned with the Pétain regime, with the same unflinching aim: retaking the métropole and taking down the Reds. As such, these deputies have proposed simply giving in to popular demands, declaring the state of emergency over, restoring the constitutional laws for the good of the stability of the republic, and calling for new elections, allowing a semblance of normal democratic life to flourish once again in the Republic.\n\nThe General was not unmoved by such arguments but has refused to give a straight answer regarding his intentions."

We believe they are the men behind the slaughter in the Casbah, and according to our infiltrated agents of the Second Bureau, they are preparing their next move. If we are not careful, their influence could become strong enough to carry on a coup against our regime.\n\nBut we will not stay around idly, we must take proactive steps. With the help of the Second bureau, we might be able to counter their move and prevent a coup, but our success remains uncertain in these conditions. To better the odds, we could try to contact the leaders of the various parties represented in parliament: although they have de facto little political power, they still have deep connections to the financial and industrial elite of our country and might be able to successfully deprive the Action Française of its financial support. Furthermore, de La Rocque’s PSF could provide invaluable help in preventing a coup.

The defeat and the revolution had already severely damaged the image of the République, recent events made sure few were still truly attached to her.

Many buildings had been damaged during the revolution, and now the war has brought more destruction: as such, plans for the restoration of the City of Lights to her pre-revolutionary beauty have already been hastily thrown together as we discover the damage for the first time. However, one question remains: what should be done with Montmartre? The hill, towering above Paris, has a rich history: starting point of the 1871 Commune, later on a romantic village within the city and most importantly where an immense neo-byzantine basilica, the Sacré-Cœur, was being built, funded by donations from all over France. Close to completion when the revolution broke out, the basilica was never consecrated and was the site of a last hold out of loyalist forces. Damaged by the fighting, the building was gleefully torn down by the Communards, who saw it as a reactionary symbol as it was built to expiate the crimes of the original Commune of Paris. In its stead they built a modernist Palace of the People, where their attempt at government met.\n\nWe have received multiple proposals for the future of Montmartre, what should be done?"

Many are present, stoic, or dazed, or crying hysterically. Some are still in hiding, some fled, and will have to be condemned in absentia. Each case is carefully examined by a court of officers, the defendant is charged with treason, mutiny, desertion, conspiracy against France, sometimes other accusations, and the verdict falls, inevitably: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.\n\nOne question remains, how to sentence the guilty. The typical sentence for military traitors is death by firing squad, however, even among our own military, there are calls for leniency on some of these officers, as they had contacted our intelligence services during or even before the war hoping to switch sides, arguing they had simply been thrust into serving a cause they did not believe in.

Their names sound familiar to our people keenly informed these last few years of their numerous crimes against France during and since the revolution: Faure, Pivert, Thorez, Jouhaux, Blum, Laval, Sartre, and many, many others. They have been given ample time to prepare their defence, some doing so admirably, others going as far as testifying against each other in hopes of reducing their sentence, or on the contrary, choosing to remain entirely silent.\n\nMost of them have been found guilty of the crimes they were accused of: what should their sentence be? Death is the expected sentence, but this would certainly create martyrs. On the other hand, a lighter sentence could seem like a show of weakness to our supporters, and convincing our people that any of these Reds deserve mercy when they refused to show any to anyone standing in the way of their crazed revolution could prove difficult."

Simply put, our reconquered people are tearing each other apart, blowing up in anger for they finally see the Reds for what they truly are, enemies of France who led them all to their collective downfall. However, these trials may have gone somewhat out of control, with unsavoury reports coming in of cruel punishments or settling of personal vendettas by the simple accusation of being a committed socialist.

Some scars will take generations to heal, but the most pressing issue is that of seized property: many are clamouring for what was theirs to be given back.\n\nWe could simply declare all transfer of property undertaken under the syndicalist regime to be null, but expropriating untold numbers of families would certainly not endear us to our reunited people. We could also accept the status quo, legitimise the ownership of seized property, and simply give indemnities to the exiles, but this might feel like a slap in the face to many. Finally, we could set up local committees investigating the claims of returning owners, which would then find a fair compromise between both parties, though this might prove complex and time-consuming."

Early this morning, President General Jean Jules Henri Mordacq signed a short declaration announcing his resignation as Head of State of the French Republic before the end of his seven years term. The Bear then gave a long speech explaining his reasons for such a decision: as a devotee of democracy, he only wishes to see her flourish, something that she could not do under a president elected in exile by a rump parliament. He thanked the French people for their tremendous effort in the reconquest of the French nation and for their loyalty towards him, and shared his wish for a future where France will never again be so divided. Of course, this decision was long-anticipated: the president of the Assembly invoked Article 7 of the Constitutional Laws, stating that in case of vacancy a new Head of State should be immediately elected by the parliament. Minor parties lying outside the coalition proposed their own candidates, but only one candidate was seriously considered, a true compromise candidate: Pierre-Étienne Flandin, a man of the moderate right, the former pilot elected to the Assembly at only 25 years old, whose skills as a knowledgeable technician made indispensable in parliamentary commissions, his advice sought after by the government and across political lines. Flandin is not a charismatic man: an admirer of British institutions and liberalism, this admiration can be felt in the character of the man, detached, phlegmatic, in stark contrast with the passionate politics of the Chamber of Deputies and so very British. This makes him perfect for the role of president."

 nfa.239.d:0 "Today, Colonel François de La Rocque handed over his resignation as Chief of the Council of Ministers to President Mordacq. Tensions in the wide Union Sacrée coalition around the Colonel had reached a boiling point, as the representatives of the traditional parties of the Third Republic could not bring themselves to agree with the wide political reforms envisioned by the PSF and worked tirelessly behind the scenes to reinforce their positions and bring back some lost prestige to their parties and to the traditional democratic institutions of the Republic. It is even rumoured that Mordacq himself intervened to prevent the coalition from entirely breaking apart in these critical times, and personally asked for the formation of a new government as a conciliatory measure. This new government headed by the PRD’s Paul Reynaud was presented to the Assembly later in the day and passed a near unanimous vote of confidence.\n\nOf course, this change in course does not mean that the PSF or de La Rocque are now in opposition with the government, and the Colonel himself does not see this as the end of his bid for power: after all the PSF is still an important party, and future electoral fortunes could certainly bring him back in the forefront of politics. In the meantime however, the party will have to take a secondary role in the coalition, a blow to its aspirations of deep reforms of the institutions of the Republic."

Today, the Colonel announced in front of the Assembly his plans for a constitutional referendum once the war is won, one that would thoroughly transform the institutions of the Republic and create a semi-presidential, democratic, more stable regime, instead of a Republic dominated by her fickle parliament. This was entirely expected of the Colonel, as this has been part of the PSF’s platform since the creation of the party. However, he ended this speech by saying that this constitutional reform would be voted on by referendum, as he argues that the French people are after all sovereign: for reform of such importance, they are the most qualified to decide upon the future of the nation.\n\nThis immediately created an uproar among partisans of the supremacy of parliament. Indeed the last time a referendum was used in such a way, it was by President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to bury the Second Republic. Name calling, accusations of tyranny flew across the hemicycle, members of parliament even came to blows, and by the end of the day it was clear the Union Sacrée had only the nominal support of much of his former allies. As such, a new government was formed under de La Rocque with those sympathetic to his plans, though President Mordacq intervened so that the appearance of unity remains in this critical time. The traditional parties of the Third Republic, in no small part responsible for her fall, have simply been left behind in the dust as Mordacq continues to revolutionise French politics."

But the burden of his increased responsibilities proved too much to bear for the monarch, already deeply affected by the weight of the exile, and his health had been on a steady decline for some time. The dauphin had stepped in to relieve his father but this wasn’t sufficient, and those in the know knew that the passing of the King was only a matter of time. Jean III’s dream to see his kingdom restored had come true, and with his family attending to him in his last moments, particularly his son the dauphin and his grandson Henri, he knew that the future was assured, that he was leaving the kingdom in good hands, that France would continue to be reformed for the best, that all the sacrifices endured by his people and by himself had not been in vain, that, at last, he could rest.\n\nA week of national mourning has been decreed, at the end of which King Jean will be buried. Jean, departed from this world and now close to God, is succeeded by his eldest son, Henri, 32 years old. The energetic young man has been particularly active in working first towards the restoration in cooperation with the Action Française, then since his father’s coronation in the matters of state. These last few years, bustling with political activity, have made sure the young prince is more than ready as a statesman, as a shrewd politician, and as King to further his father’s dream.\n\nThe King is dead, long live the King!"

And so, instead of heading back to the residence of the archbishops of Reims for a private reception, His Majesty chose to head out of the cathedral on foot accompanied by his young son, mingling for some time with his new subjects, almost to prove to the reconquered nation, and perhaps to himself, that this was all indeed real: the red beast was slain, the kingdom was well and truly reborn, this war pitting brothers against brothers was over.

The idea of going back to the white and gold fleurs-de-lys of the Ancien Régime has long been abandoned by the Action Française, though it remains the royal standard, and the blue, white and red flag is now accepted even among committed royalists. But if the colours are uncontroversial, the presence of the royal arms on the flag is not. Adopted in exile, mostly out of practicality, many expect our current ensign to be replaced by a plain Tricolore, once and for all co-opting this symbol for the monarchist cause.

Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber Muslim population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the indigènes."

Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled \"The Political Consequences of Peace\", Bainvillle exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among exiles, and Bainville’s funeral procession was followed by thousands of mourners, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending his funeral mass.

The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture.

It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thénévoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thénévoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed.

Rejecting both reaction and liberalism, secularism and intransigent political Catholicism, embracing humanism, arguing for human rights, the importance of family, pluralistic democracy and responsibility toward the common good, all in the spirit of the social teachings of the Church, the philosopher is somewhat going against the grain. Indeed, much of the French Catholic laity and hierarchy has been radicalised by the current situation: the AF has even denounced \"Integral Humanism\" as the work of a traitor, a sell-out to \"democratism\", a red saboteur. However among more progressive Catholics Maritain’s work was very well received, getting praise from Father Montini, a close advisor of the pope, and with some moderates even being drawn away from the Action Française, heeding his warning that the movement is merely using the Faith as a tool to further their political ideology."

The crowd dispersed, and four laid dead. Ever since this grim day, it has been commemorated by the Maltese. As the British revolution came to a close in 1926, local authorities became increasingly nervous for the future of Malta, with mutiny, nationalist and socialist agitation, or occupation by another power seeming like increasingly real threats: the Germans being already in the process of seizing much of the empire would certainly not pass up an opportunity to spread their influence to the Mittelmeer. As such, the governor, Sir Walter Norris Congreve, called on us to secure the islands for the Entente, and French marine infantry obliged. Malta was granted much autonomy in dealing with day to day matters, officially still part of the British Empire but by now effectively a French protectorate, a state of affairs acceptable to both the small British elite content with maintaining their power and nationalists now enjoying something approaching home rule. As such, the Sette Giugno was made an official holiday of remembrance and hope for unity. Though no longer the headquarter of the Mediterranean fleet, the island is still the lock of the Strait of the Sicily, the bastion assuring Entente dominance over the Western Mediterranean: a large garrison is maintained on the island and much was invested to expand the defences and ports of the islands, reflecting its critical role in our naval strategy."

As such it has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and airbase from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the mainland, with tense face-offs with Internationale ships occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of exiles landed, and though most moved on to Algeria, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that paired with the military build-up has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms. Though there is no longer a stream of refugees like in the early days of the Commune, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero’s welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul \"the Emperor\" Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the métropole.

Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the state under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many Algerians and some Frenchmen believe this is a conspiracy, and that el-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment. We could drop charges against el-Okbi, somewhat losing face but preventing any further unrest and possibly gaining an ally within the Association, or we could keep him in jail, getting rid of a prominent indigène leader and sowing dissent among the ulemas."

A master of physical comedy and slapstick, adding to it a talent for singing, his movies generally featuring a few humorous songs that then prove to be successes in their own right, he has often been compared to American actor Charlie Chaplin. This time the actor plays Fernand, a hen-pecked husband who, after getting knocked out, wakes up in a caravan heading towards the Algerian interior, his identity papers stolen and replaced by new ones: he is now another man, a new volunteer in the French Foreign Legion. Incapable of explaining his situation to his officer, Fernand is called to fight some unruly tribe deep in the Sahara desert, and despite early mishaps, he quickly finds military life much more enjoyable than his marriage, and especially much less disciplined. Now truly a whole new man, he is eventually tracked down by his wife but instead chooses to re-enlist under his real name, becoming a veritable hero and eventually being awarded the Legion of honour. The humorous tale has proven particularly popular among veterans."

Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners, sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering \"All is Grace\".\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticising clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this \"Diary\", a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."

Telling the story of captain Benoit, played by Jean Murat, sent on a mission by the Second Bureau, our elusive military intelligence agency, to seize the blueprints of the latest red weapon in the very heart of the Commune, this movie has it all: action, suspense, and of course, romance. Of course, the handsome captain is eventually noticed by Communard counter-intelligence, who sends their best agent after him: Elise, true femme fatale, tasked with seducing the agent. Of course the two fall in love, and plan on escaping together: as the Communards realise this, she sacrifices herself and dies in her lover’s arms, forcefully reminded of his duty to France.\n\nCritics hated it, calling it cheap entertainment, and yet, the public loved it, and asked for more, dismissing rumours that the film received state funding to transform the public image of the secretive and sometimes sinister agency as mere Communard propaganda."

Set in Algiers, particularly in the labyrinthic and exotic old town, the Casbah, the movie tells the story of Pépé, played by Gabin, a former big shot in the Parisian underworld now in hiding, and the men trying to catch him, both law enforcement and syndicalist agents looking to put down once and for all a major organiser of the black market within the Commune. Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, played by Balin, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to \"slum it\" among natives and emigrants in the sensual and dangerous world of the Casbah. The two strike up a relationship, igniting the jealousy of Pépé’s mistress. This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it’s hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic. And Pépé, quintessential anti-hero, criminal but principled, has become a bit of a youth icon as many identify with his situation at the crossroad of two worlds, French and native, as well as with his melancholic longing for Paris."

Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, a sense of belonging, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell’s books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys around seven years old, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford. However, these groups have remained largely isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts that would permit greater cooperation and standardisation of scouting practices among the indigènes. Already, prominent native voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along with loyalty to France, while some more conservative pieds-noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the patrie they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria. More pragmatic voices in government argue that giving our approval to this federation would grant us much greater oversight over a largely autonomous initiative."

However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of red terror, profanations, and acts of syndicalist violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil. Committees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, \"Aux Martyrs Espagnols\" calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs: it has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."

Slowly, indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become an incredibly popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club’s goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."

Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the war is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling a wide variety of themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the war ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House.

Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution brewing in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat’s hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of \"Soldier-Prince\" and a promotion to the rank of general. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco’s national day falling on the Prince’s patron saint’s feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France’s political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince’s palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."

Instead, he dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting physical activity integration into education. However, de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and making them an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Panhellenic games. The first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics could not prevent the madness of the Great War. Following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Pierre de Coubertin was heartbroken by the death at the front of two of his nephews and the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics that neither of the Frances attended. He was forced to watch as his dream crumbled before his eyes. As the socialist powers grew in prominence, the Socialist Worker's Sport International began to draw away the dignity that he built the Olympics to be. Intended to be a contest of the nations' finest athletes, the socialists soured the games by basing them along mass participation rather than athletic heroism. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."

Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony. Since the exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the métropole."

Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation \"to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser\", proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from \"civilised\" people and that they too have a long and rich history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself Dahomean. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing a generally pro-French sentiment but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction. This decision which could have proved controversial has instead been generally met with praise from much of colonial society, though for varying reasons: where some évolués see proof, if one was ever needed, of the intellectual equality of the Black man, some in the colonial government see proof of the success of the civilising mission."

Their relationship is cordial and polite enough, though understandably chilly due to geopolitical considerations, but a fight breaking out between sailors of the different crews prevents any further fraternisation. However, an incident brings them together: arms traffickers are spotted leaving the harbour, and in their flight have released poison gas. The deadly cloud is slowly drifting towards a passenger ship, and the men put aside their differences to save the civilians, going straight through the gas with little protection: the civilians are rescued and the traffickers stopped. Despite their heroism, all the crews lose some men, including the Red British officer, and they are all buried with full military honours.\n\nDirected by the profoundly Catholic director Léo Joannon, filmed at sea with the help of our navy, on real ships and with real sailors as extras, the movie was hit with criticism from some who found distasteful the positive image of the German and British characters, going as far as taxing the movie of pacifism. Against such critics, the director argued that the core message of the picture is one of Christian fraternity, bravery and camaraderie in the face of adversity, despite eternally rising international tensions."

Furthermore, with Guénon's conversion to Sufism many of these Masons and other types are increasingly interested in the native Sufi Tariqas or Orders. With the AF now in power, this relationship is increasingly troubling, with some proclaiming it the return of Gnosticism and Quietism, both of which are excommunicated heresies.

This occultist milieu produced various New Religious and Philosophical Currents claiming ancient lineages and hidden knowledge, supposedly handed down by cabals of Masons, Magicians and Alchemists. From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental Religions and Metaphysical Systems. However, following the defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-Materialist tracts and published "The Crisis of the Modern World" in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, \"Oriental Metaphysics\" is a detailed exploration of Oriental Metaphysical Systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the Liberal worldview of their recent past in favour of a Traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences. Calls for a ban of the book have arisen from clergy and conservative Catholics, while others argue that it could be helpful in evangelisation, or control, of the natives."

Our current exile has led many, particularly academics and clergymen, to seek a better understanding of the faith of so many of our countrymen. Some out of genuine interest or hope of interfaith dialogue, while others dream of large-scale conversion of the indigènes to Christianity. A recent open letter published anonymously in \"En Terre d’Islam\" is threatening the fragile religious equilibrium, however. The letter, calling for the formation of a \"Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims\" to \"pray for our estranged brothers\" was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Morrocan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to \"study the enemy\". A year later he would convert, two years and he joined the Franciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and was overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."

Shockingly, they found that this \"François-Henry Prométhée\" has never existed, and is merely the pseudonym of Maurice Delaunay, a farmer from Normandy, who after brilliant studies at the National Institute for Horticulture and a brief stint in politics has seemingly lost his mind.

Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois. \nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto.

Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of the stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, sceptical of both the sincerity of the AF’s promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Communards."

Finally free from censorship, it seems journalists are relishing in this effort to tear down the man who restored freedom of expression.

Of course restoring censorship would be unthinkable, but there exist legal means to stifle this flow of defamation.

Invoking the 1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press, they were accused of inciting 'offences against the public interest', and were put on trial. \nThis, however, backfired. Not only this made the Comité de Salut National look tyrannical, and made the criticism look founded, but it was utterly ineffective. The trials were turned into platforms for these men to criticise the new political order, arguing that it was at best another flavour of tyranny, and that this effort to stifle their right to freedom of expression went against the very ideals that led them to fight against the Pétain regime.

 nfa.512.d:0 "More than a hundred and ten years since there was last a royal coronation, France finally has a king once again. The ceremony was carefully organised to follow as closely as possible the millennium old protocol, despite taking place in the Saint-Philippe cathedral of Algiers instead of the traditional coronation in Reims, which current circumstances would make difficult to organise. Much of the necessary ceremonial items, like the sword Joyeuse, said to have been the sword of Charlemagne, as well as the Holy Ampulla, glass vial holding anointing oil said to have been given by the Holy Spirit for the baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, had been evacuated during the retreat from the mainland and new regalia was crafted by skilled artisans, particularly an ornate crown.\n\nAfter swearing oaths on the Scriptures to defend the Church, maintain peace, fight injustice, be merciful and just, as well as fight heresy, Jean d’Orléans was anointed in nine spots in the shape of a cross with holy oil by the archbishop of Algiers, then was draped in a blue cloak sprinkled with gold fleurs-de-lys, given the sceptre and the hand of justice, and, finally, crowned. Peers of the reborn kingdom swore fidelity to His Majesty, then a mass was said. This done, the king and the royal family headed out for their new residence, the former presidential palace in the heights of Algiers, cheered on the whole way there by a numerous crowd, public celebrations and banquets taking place well into the late hours of the night. Some important details were altered in the ceremony, however: the king did not swear the traditional oath to fight infidels and was instead given by the mufti of Algiers a traditional flyssa sword representing his new status of Hāmī al-Islām or Protector of Islam, and among the peers swearing fidelity to His Majesty were numerous Arab, Berber or African chiefs in their traditional costumes, symbol of a new era of French rule."

 nfa.513.t:0 "Women's Suffrage"
 nfa.513.d:0 "The issue of women’s suffrage has been a contentious one in French politics for a long while. At the revolution, women were considered \"passive citizens\", a category shared with children and domestics: in other words citizens who were inherently under the influence of another and as such could not be trusted with the right to vote. In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality. They were again excluded in 1870 when the Third Republic was declared. Though there were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women’s suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women’s suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband’s will, or worse, the Church’s.\nCharles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."

But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d’Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armoured: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."

The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regina Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place.

The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

Though a part of the population had initially welcomed the annexation, it quickly became clear that without independence, gambling or tourism, the former principality was little more than a backwards if pretty little town and opinion towards the Communards quickly soured. A treaty was signed later in the day with French representatives, deepening the mutual commitment of the two states towards each other already established by the 1918 treaty of 'protective friendship', and ensuring that the fate of France and Monaco would from now on forever be linked."

Coming from a prestigious family of ulema, claiming to be descendants from the medieval Zyrid dynasty which had ruled Ifriqiya centuries ago, Ben Badis was destined to a comfortable life as an Islamic scholar, part of the native elites far from the struggles of his fellow indigènes. Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centers of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the \"City of Bridges\". As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the pieds-noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of independentist talk."

But we have finally been contacted by its leader, Alsatian textile industrialist Paul Dungler, nicknamed Commandant Martial, a citizen of the Reich. With German cash, given under the pretences of funding study of the Genisteae flower in the hills of the Vosges region, Commandant Martial quickly built a disciplined network gathering information on Communard infrastructure and troop movements in the East, implementing weapons and explosives caches all over the Vosges and in Alsace, creating armed networks in Lorraine as well as stay-behind groups should the Commune advance past the Vosges. However, unbeknown to his German patrons, Dungler believes that Alsace is a rightful part of France and his network has been gathering an immense wealth of information from within the German intelligence framework as well as cultivating links within the armies of the Reich of disgruntled Alsatian soldiers and officers.\n\nHe has now offered us his services as a double agent, giving us access to his network to prepare the liberation of France, and we would be foolish to refuse.

Despite these conciliatory words, for close to two decades they enviously observed as we spread French civilisation and built a globe-spanning empire. More than once, we rebuked their attempts at expansion: they made us pay this dearly. Utterly defeated in Africa, their subjects breathing a sigh of relief as the Teuton yoke was finally lifted, we were nevertheless forced to concede to Germany much of our colonies as part of the conditions of the 1919 Armistice. We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favourable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, colossal patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar-es-Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé von Göring as head of the chimeric \"Deutsch-Mittelafrika\", the overambitious Flying Ogre only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered.

The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly reestablish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources.

 nfa.532.d:0 "The Tour de France was before the exile without contest the most popular sport event of the year, followed by millions on the radio and along the roads of France, as cycle sports fans showed up to cheer for their idols. The Tour’s precise itinerary was different every year, and having the event pass through one’s town or village was certainly the event of the summer. The revolution did not hamper the enthusiasm of France for the Tour, though the number of foreign participants starkly dropped. Indeed, cycle sports were even encouraged by the Communard authorities as a proletarian alternative to motorsports, much like football was promoted over rugby. Even in exile, our people listened intently to the Tour on the radio, leading to the creation of a rival Tour d’Algérie which did find much success, though it never stopped our people from illegally tuning in to red radio stations to follow the competition.\n\nWith the mainland reconquered however, it is time to organise once again the Tour de France, hopefully bringing, if only briefly, our still deeply divided people together. However, within the committee tasked with determining the itinerary a question arose: should this Tour also pass through Algeria? After all, the Algerian departments are a part of France like any other. Medical experts have warned that this would turn the competition into an almost two-months long affair and that the sweltering heat of the Maghrebi summers could make more than one cyclist collapse, but the symbolic triumph of a unified tour could certainly make this risk worth it."

The anti-clerical number however destroyed some of these churches, took them over for secular use, or simply let them fall into disrepair. Now that the war is over and Normandie has been freed, a question arises: should we rebuild this part of Rouen’s history as part of reconstruction efforts? Many of our Catholic citizens believe that the churches should be rebuilt as they were, a way to exorcise the godless past, however this would have a certain cost, especially when the money could be redirected to more urgent causes. Alternatively, we can rebuild some of them while giving them another purpose, like housing concert venues or public libraries. This way, the history of the city would be preserved while making an efficient use of money. Or we could simply tear down the most damaged ones and restore only a few, to make more space for new buildings."

Much like in so many cities and villages across France, it will take years to rebuild. However, one heap of slowly rusting metal is turning into a playground for local children and attracting the curiosity of a few onlookers: a disabled heavy British tank in particularly good shape, once a lynchpin of the local Syndicalist defence, stuck in a ditch right outside Vimoutiers. \n\nOf course, the authorities attempted to seize the tank as part of the country-wide effort to heal the scars of the war, either to scrap it for parts and metal or study it further. But the Vimonastériens refused, even chasing away one cleanup crew: children cried at the thought of losing their playground, while the adults had grown strangely attached to the wreck. Of course the near pristine state of the tank has spurned numerous jokes about the bravery of the British troops but mostly the locals seem fascinated by the object, its newfound peaceful quietness perhaps a symbol of the slow return to normalcy across France. In any case, the local mayor said he intends to turn the tank into a monument. What should be done?"

Following the fall of the Eternal City, these volunteers immediately headed to France to fight bravely in the Franco-Prussian War. These devout Catholics, many of them royalists, headed by Baron Athanase de Charette de La Contrie, descendant of a famous leader of the Vendée insurrection, nevertheless set aside their differences with the Republic to fight against the Prussian aggressor. Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading \"Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France\" was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit. They will head to Rome and proudly stand guard on the Tiber, representing the French faithful united as one in their duty to defend the Church."

It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honour, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty. The Republic in her foolish civilising mission had sought to turn the Indigène into a Frenchman. The Monarchy only asks of the Indigène one thing: to serve France, and be ready to fight and die for his King."

Once the rulers of the island from where they embarked on numerous raids against Barbary pirates, a true fighting force made up of the noblest warriors of Christendom, the Knights were defeated by the armies of the impostor Bonaparte. Malta annexed, its possessions seized, the Order was exiled and dispersed. The Hospitallers instead chose to focus on their original mission, caring for the poor and sick. With one exception: an elite auxiliary military corps, mostly dedicated to medical functions, serving with the Italian army. But united Italy is no more and therein lies the agreement the Knights are offering us. In exchange of rather limited concessions, for example granting extraterritoriality to some locations historically associated with the Order, the Knights are offering to reform their auxiliary force to serve under the French flag, assisting us in our crusade to free the Métropole. Of course this would mean taking liberties with a British colony, something our friends would not appreciate, and the actual benefits to us would largely consist in a propaganda opportunity, though the expertise of the Order is undeniable.

A passionate of the Classics, looking back to Rome as the foundation of European civilisation and France as her foremost heir, the practicality of such a project is of little interest to the Master, who extends the definition of \"Latin\" to include the whole of Southern Europe, much of South America, and even South Germany, Switzerland and Romania, gleefully blurring the line between \"Latin\" culture and Catholicism. Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies. \n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany. These groups have even had some limited but rather positive effects, fostering good relations between our nations and turning into what could be described as an international think tank of fellow-minded Integralists."

 nfa.539.t:0 "The Impossible Hajj"
 nfa.539.d:0 "The Hajj is a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca established by the Prophet Muhammad. Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu’min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfil this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire. \n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."

 nfa.540.d:0 "This winter is particularly rough, and all over France the scars of war run deep: many are still without a home, in the streets or in precarious living conditions, crowded in refugee camps. Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest has taken to the radio to call for an \"insurrection of Goodness\". Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised \"Emmaüs\" welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national preeminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shockwave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and \"Abbé Henri\" as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of a Emmaüs charity network are already underway."

However the fate of \"La Marseillaise\" is sowing dissension even among our partisans.\n\nMany have no issue with the song, including Maurras himself, much like few have issues with the Tricolore: it has accompanied Frenchmen in some of the most glorious moments of the last century and its lyrics could easily be understood as more broadly patriotic than republican. On the other hand, a minority desires a total rejection of anything brought by the revolution, arguing that we could not fight one revolution while the embers of the previous one still burn. As such they demand the reintroduction of the anthem instated following the fall of the impostor Buonaparte, \"Le Retour des Princes Français à Paris\", based on the melody of the popular song \"Vive le roi Henri\". A compromise was also proposed: the armies of the counter-revolution had themselves adopted a modified version of the song, called \"La Marseillaise des Blancs\", the \"Marseillaise of the Whites\", with radically different lyrics, which could satisfy everyone: after all it would be a shame to waste such a stirring melody."

A mere decade after the proclamation of the \"Portuguese Republic\", a broad coalition of royalists took control of Lisbon and declared the restoration of the monarchy from the balcony of the Torreão Poente, overlooking the Terreiro do Paço, beating heart of the city. In 1927 however, following renewed economic turmoil and national humiliation inflicted in Africa by the Germans, a coup was engineered by Lusitanian Integralists, men inspired by Maurras and the Action Française, and a new government set out to restore Tradition and Faith in the small nation and its globe-spanning empire. Portugal had become a living experiment, a showcase of the possibility of the true counter-revolution. Portuguese implementation of the Integralist dream was followed intently by the Action Française, each development praised in dithyrambic articles, each setback explained as the work of red agitators and other saboteurs. \n\nWith France following in Portugal’s footsteps, this state visit is seen by Lusitanian Integralists as a crowning success, proof of their prescience, and by many Portuguese as a source of national pride. The Dauphin toured the many sights of Lisbon and her surroundings accompanied by King Duarte II, before travelling to the small village of Fátima, in a pilgrimage to the site where the Virgin Mary appeared to tens of thousands. The princes and their close entourage then retired to Pena Palace for some well-deserved rest. It seems the two young men bonded over their shared experience and a budding friendship was born. And if court gossip is to be believed, something more might unite the two soon: young King Duarte was apparently struck by the beauty of Henri’s sister-in-law, Brazilian princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Bragança, accompanying her sister Isabelle on this diplomatic tour.

Outnumbered and initially suffering heavy casualties, the royal army prevailed thanks to its iron will, winning for the King a decisive victory. One force in particular illustrated itself facing the British Coldstream Guards, sending the elite force in a frenzied retreat, even seizing their banner: the six regiments of the Irish Brigade. These brave exiled Jacobite Irishmen served France for generations, never letting go of their hope to see one day a free Ireland, fighting for our kings against the \"fheall na Sasanach\", the treachery of the British. \n\nTheir dreams have now come true: Ireland is free, and the \"Sasanach\" being our closest allies will not stop us from commemorating Irish blood shed for France and the unbreakable bond uniting our two nations. Royal representatives travelled to Dublin to participate in a ceremony honouring the Irish Brigade on the day of their triumph at Fontenoy, where a monument funded by the donations of French and Irish Integralists was unveiled and enthusiastic speeches, in approximate Irish on our part, approximate French on theirs, were warmly received by a large crowd. The ceremony over, intense discussion took place between representatives of the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe party and our envoys on a variety of topics, such as the translation of the works of Charles Maurras into the Irish language, our ongoing process of counter-revolution, as well as further funding for their movement that they claim will soon be a favourable position to seize power: looking positively starstruck, these determined young men assured us that Ireland will once again stand with France to help us achieve our dream of freeing our homeland, against both Communards and Boches."

Though the purchase of any goods from the mainland is officially banned and likewise the Commune has desperately tried to enforce an embargo against us, there exists a thriving black market controlled in large part by our assets, recruited from either ideological sympathisers or organised crime, with wine and cheese being especially sought after, as they are after all essential goods.

After such a success, possibly helped by a titillating cover and a dirt cheap price, a sequel has already been released and five more are already planned for the next year alone. They tell the thrilling stories of suave French operative Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, codename 2B 117, who travels around the world to fight bloodthirsty revolutionaries, all in between of what seems to be his main occupation: seducing and breaking the hearts of both high-class ladies and women of the night, of all allegiances, nationalities and creeds, these love affairs of course being described in torrid details. Here, the spy gets involved with Parisian organised crime to secure stolen documents of critical importance, there he stalks the red light district of Shanghai, looking for a turncoat, then we find him singing in a Cairo café or lost in the favelas of Rio: the novels have little artistic merit and will not win any literary prizes but this is of little concern to the author.

The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies.

They come in and leave the palace discreetly and transporting nothing but there is no doubt the Bey is transmitting them important pieces of information. Moncef Bey is the son of one of the previous honorary monarch of the protectorate of Tunisia, Naceur Bey, and is the grand-nephew of the current ruling Bey, Ahmed II. He has always been remarked for his opposition to the French regime and he doesn't hide too much his likening for the Tunisian nationalists.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning considering Moncef is the next on the line of succession to the statute of Bey after Ahmed II.

After only 20 minutes the crowd, visibly getting larger by the minute, was already spreading to all of the small streets around the square accompanied by a tumultuous clamour. At the center of the gathering was a young Algerian militant. Even if only in his twenties, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observers were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Etoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land. \nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd. This incident can't be ignored, and can't be taken lightly. It is representative of the strategy of the ENA to spread its ideas and supplies to a talented younger generation of militants in Algeria for them to start the fight for independence in Africa with support from the French Commune. While their attempted struggle is far from being over, it isn't a reason to be lenient. We must take care to not let any comparable event happen again."

The ENA is a syndicalist party, founded in Paris by Messali Hadj, forbidden in Algeria and radically opposed to the current French rule. The Action Algérienne however is legal and its leader, Fehrat Abbas believes in assimilationism into a Greater France and calls for a greater traditional autonomy.

In reality the lower classes mostly work under a regime of forced labour called by the colonial authorities, most notably to build infrastructure.\nThe Senegalese society is thus very stratified, and this is something the lower classes seem to be starting to realise. Murmurs of jealousy and questioning of the system have spread to the Senegalese working class.

The discussion was unbelievable, the 'évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny anymore. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar...

The French presence wasn't planned, and it only constituted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuaregs.

In April 1919, Pétain would replace Ferdinand Foch as overall commander of French forces but would be unable to organise any offensives before the war ended later that year. Pétain would maintain his leadership role through the subsequent Revolution and would organise much of the exiled military that ended up in Algiers."

His early commands ranged from France to Algeria to China, and by 1913 was in command of the I Corps. During the Weltkrieg, Franchet d'Espèrey would fight in many of the early battles; among them Charleroi, Guise, and the Marne. He would also develop a… particular… form of command in order to push his officers to follow his orders. He ordered that any officer not doing their duty were to be shot, and he would break up roadblocks by firing a pistol repeatedly until everyone understood his message. This style of command would not avail him however, and despite promotions first to the Eastern Army Group and then the Northern Army Group, he failed to produce substantial victories. Eventually he was forced into exile as the Revolution took hold, and now serves as the eldest officer in the reorganised French Army, aside from Philippe Pétain himself."

By the time of the Weltkrieg he was a second lieutenant assigned to the 12th Dragoon Regiment. His career during the Weltkrieg was marked by taking and surviving a total of seven wounds, five of which were taken at the Battle of Verdun. For these injuries he became well decorated; receiving eight citations, The Legion of Honour, and the British Military Cross. He remained loyal to the government as the revolution took hold, and fleeing south, was eventually promoted to Colonel."
 NFA_CHARLES_DEGAULLE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n22 November 1890 in Lille, Nord.\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nCharles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle, a staunch Catholic would enter the military academy of Saint-Cyr in 1910 and would prove a capable student, graduating 13th in his class in 1912, joining the 33rd infantry regiment of infantry under the orders of then Colonel Pétain. De Gaulle would enter the Great War as a first lieutenant, and the 33rd regiment would see action very early on at Dinant. At Dinant he would be thrown right into the fire and was one of the first to be wounded, taking a bullet to the knee. While recovering he wrote about the shortcomings of the French officer staff and how slow he felt the British troops were. He would rejoin his regiment and by December he became a regimental adjutant. His unit became well known for sneaking through No Man’s Land to listen in on enemy conversations, and for this de Gaulle would be rewarded the Croix de Guerre in January of 1915. Another injury in March would take him out of the fighting for four months, and by September he became captain of the 10th company. In the Battle of Verdun, de Gaulle would take a bayonet in the thigh and be captured as a result. He would spend the next few months in German captivity. During this time, he read German newspapers, wrote his first book, and eventually escaped. De Gaulle was granted a hero’s welcome when he returned, becoming a symbol of French defiance against the Germans. He would go home to his family but would not be at peace due to the Revolution. De Gaulle and his family would follow the government in exile to Algiers, where he would join loyalist officers. He has become famous in exile as a military lecturer and theorist and is a close associate of Marshal Pétain."

Weygand was admitted to the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr as a foreign cadet and become a cavalryman. Eventually he would be promoted to captain and become an instructor at the Saumur Cavalry School. At the outbreak of the Weltkrieg he would spend a short amount of time on the front lines before spending most of the rest of the war in the general staff of Ferdinand Foch. Weygand was promoted to général de brigade in 1916. His final promotion would be near the end of the war, as Ferdinand Foch was sidelined by Pétain and Weygand was promoted to fill much needed gaps in command. His new rank as général de division would make him a target by association during the revolution, and he would be one of the generals to flee across the sea. He spends much of his time in Algeria as an inspector for the army and trying to organise what troops the Republic has available."

He spent quite a lot of time writing, and later as an instructor, eventually becoming the head of military courses at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in 1912. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Mordacq was chief of staff of general Archinard's First Reserve Corps Group in the Eastern Army. He would take frontline command of the 159th Regiment of Alpine Infantry and fight in the Battle of the Frontiers as well as defend Arras from German occupation. As the war dragged on, he became witness to the first poison gas attack, and fought at both the Somme and Verdun. His last promotion before the revolution would be to become the military chief of staff to Georges Clemenceau’s second government.

After graduating on 1 October 1912, Juin was commissioned as a sous-lieutenant in an Algerian regiment, the 1st Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment. During the Weltkrieg, he would suffer an injury that would permanently damage his right arm. As a result of this, he is a rare breed of soldier given permission to salute with his left hand."
