Not only that, but it's not even known what the Qing will think about this turn of events, leaving Jin with absolute power over the entirety of Xinjiang until news is heard."

In almost a celebration of the circumstances, the Dao-yin of Aksu and foreign minister of Xinjiang, Fan Yaonan, has announced a party, inviting many government officials, including Yang Zengxin. Yang's isolation has led most to expect him to decline this, but perhaps Yang could make use of a day of luxury with the recent stresses of governing?"

Fan Yaonan returned ten minutes later, with two guards with guns and red arm bands in tow behind him as he sits down again.\n\n\"A toast, to Yang's continued health!\"\n\nYang raised his glass as well, a smile on his face until he realised what was happening.

They already knew the reason behind this, as this was no accident, but the workings of Sheng to remove his remaining political rivals once and for all. The three men under Ma Shaowu rode north with a small regiment in the hopes of being able to overthrow Sheng swiftly before he has time to react. This is their last resort as the fate of Xinjiang lies on the table, but whether such a desperate gambit can even succeed is another question."

In fact, the entire building was empty, without a trace of any soul. All of this was in the report given to Sheng, as panic began to set in over the whereabouts of his three rivals. He would meet them sooner then expected however, as them and their army soon surrounded Aksu before Sheng could react. Sheng had been betrayed, as his own northern government was infiltrated by agents of the three men allowing this plot to occur. Sheng has no choice but to surrender, leaving him to be imprisoned with his fate decided at a later point, as Shaowu now rules over Xinjiang in his Triumvirate alongside Mahmut Muhti and Burhan Shahidi."

A firefight broke out as, from the peak of a nearby hill, a band of soldiers, around 18 strong, charged down the hill, led by Xinjiang Clique general Burhan Shahidi. The group were able to kill the 7 guards outside the house, but lost 3 themselves. As they approached the house, they lost 2 more to guards shooting out from the window. Shahidi himself kicked through the door and shot another guard through the head with his pistol. The group travelled through the house and killed another 3 guards, losing none themselves. Now, the only one left was Sabit Damulla. As they approached Sabit's bedroom, Shahidi reloaded his pistol, smiling at his success. However, when he bashed through the door, all he found was an empty bed and an open window. Shahidi realised his mistake of not leaving more soldiers outside to guard the perimeter, as Sabit Damulla slipped through his grasp. Within the hour hundreds of Sabits troops got to the house, but by then Shahidi and his men had gone.\n\nThough the assassination was a failure, it will still have dire consequences.

However, by the time he got to Sabit's bedroom, he had escaped.\n\nThough Shahidi failed in his mission, this is not a total loss.

The intrepid few with connections in Gansu, however, have reported that Yang has not been seen in Gansu, but traces of his gold bullion have shown up in the hands of trade merchants in Yunnan.
