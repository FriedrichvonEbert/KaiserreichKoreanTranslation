 SCA_Subsidize_Nordic_Farms_desc:0 "The Nordic farmers are what keeps this federation fed. It would only be right to support their work for this great federation by subsidising their activities, lowering their prices and giving them an edge over the competition."

 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries:0 "개별군대 유지"
 SCA_Maintain_Separate_Militaries_desc:0 "While purely from the perspective of efficiency, a single merged army is best, it will be significantly easier to motivate the people's of our federation to fight under their own flag under that of the federation, where they may be subject to language differences as well."
