 HAI_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Krag–Jørgensen rifle was adopted by the United States in 1892 to replace the ageing Springfield Model 1884. While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."

The rifle was gradually adopted along with the .30-06 cartridge both before and while the rest of the world waged the Weltkrieg."

While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."

The MAB-38 can be recognised by its machined steel receiver, fine craftsmanship, and perforated cooling jacket over the barrel. The gun fires 9x19mm Parabellum at 600 rounds per minute, making it a deadly weapon in close quarters and urban combat. Interestingly enough, the gun features two triggers for two firing modes; the fore trigger is for semi-automatic fire while the rear trigger is for fully automatic."

The firing rate and low magazine capacity makes the weapon more ideal as a semi-automatic rifle instead of a light machine gun. The Mortaio 81 is a lightweight Brandt-style mortar that has seen great feedback in the testing ranges due to its range capacity and reliability. The mortar uses two shells; one heavy high-explosive shell and another lighter shell for long-distance fire."

 ITA_support_weapons4:0 "Breda Mod.5C & Mortaio da 81 CEMSA L.P"
 ITA_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The Breda Mod.5C is an Italian heavy machine gun. A reflection of Italian military doctrine, the Breda was intended for ambushes and attacks. While its rate of fire is slow (as with most Italian machine guns); the Breda 5C was still regarded as one of the deadliest weapons in the Italian arsenal given the Italain Army's lack of heavy machine guns and submachine guns."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Type 38"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Adopted by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1905, the '38th year 'of the Meiji Period (hence its name); the Type 38 uses the 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridges. This cartridge produces little recoil when fired. The Type 38 at 128 cm is a long rifle due to the emphasis on bayonet training for Japanese soldiers of this era."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Arisaka Type 99"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Type 99"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Type 99 is intended to serve as a replacement for the Type 38. The Imperial Army recognised the weaknesses of the Type 38 and pushed for the Type 99 to serve as its replacement. The Type 99 was produced in four versions: the regular issue rifle, the 'long' rifle, a paratroop rifle, and a sniper variant."
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Kawamura Type 14"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Type 14"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "In 1931, the Japanese Army approached Kijiro Nambu to design a new semi-automatic rifle. His design, based on the Pedersen Rifle, which had been unsuccessfully presented to Japan years earlier, ultimately led nowhere due both to difficulties with the Pedersen delayed-blowback toggle-lock system and the unrealistic goals of the Army. However, two refined rifles based upon the Pedersen system would resurface several years later. The design of Masaya Kawamura, of the Nippon Special Steel Company, would ultimately be chosen and adopted by Japan as the Type 14 due to its reliability and ability to function without the need for wax-lubricated cartridges."

 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Type 4"
 JAP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "Japan has long relied on bolt action rifles, and their age is beginning to show. Thus, with the Type 14, the Imperial Army at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal has designed the Type 4 semi-automatic rifle. Charged with two 5-round stripper clips, Type 4 comes in two variants: the navy and the other for the army. The development of this weapon would give the Japanese infantryman significantly more firepower on the battlefield than previous weapons."
 JAP_infantry_at:0 "Type 97 Anti-Tank Rifle"
 JAP_infantry_at_desc:0 ""Given the fact that German tanks exist in China as well as the ever-present threat of the Russian bear on the borders, Type 97 was designed to combat armored vehicles. The gun is a monstrosity of a weapon; it has an overall length of 2.09 metres and weighs 52 kilograms (115 pounds). Capable of penetrating 30mm of armour at a range of 250 metres; it is truly a fearsome weapon in the right hands."
 JAP_infantry_at2:0 "Type 4 70mm anti-tank Rocket Launcher"
 JAP_infantry_at2_desc:0 "The rocket launcher was made in two parts that are to be joined in the middle. Intended to be fired while lying down prone; the Type 4 rocket launcher uses a bipod and a mortar fuze. Interestingly enough, the Type 4 rocket uses angled venturis in the base to spin the rocket for stability."
 JAP_support_weapons:0 "Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun & Type 11 mortar"
 JAP_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun was based on the design of the French Hotchkiss M1914. The Type 3 uses an ammo strip for loading rounds, and its tripod could be used for anti-aircraft mounting. The Type 11 mortar was developed in the 11th year of the Taisho Emperor. Exceptional amongst Japanese weapons; Type 11 is a muzzle-loaded weapon with a rifled bore."
 JAP_support_weapons2:0 "Type 11 LMG & Type 10 grenade discharger"
 JAP_support_weapons2_desc:0 "Combat experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905 taught the Imperial Army the utility of machine guns providing covering fire. The Type 11 was developed by the famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu based on a French Hotchkiss M1909 and is air-cooled and gas-operated. A unique feature about the Type 11 machine gun is its detachable hopper; it can be refilled while attached and does not require removal during operation. The Type 10 grenade discharger was a smoothbore muzzle-loaded weapon with an incredible range of 175 metres."
 JAP_support_weapons3:0 "Type 99 LMG & Type 94 mortar"
 JAP_support_weapons3_desc:0 "The Type 99 LMG uses the new rounds found in the Arisaka Type 99. Retaining the same design as previous light machine guns and bears a resemblance to the English Enfield-Automatic. The Type 99 also allows for the attachment of a standard-issue bayonet and 2.5x telescopic sight for marksmanship. The Type 94 mortar is a heavy mortar that has a range of 4000 yards. It is intended to serve as an artillery piece that could be hauled in pieces to remote areas."
 JAP_support_weapons4:0 "Type 1 HMG & Type 2 12 cm Mortar"
 JAP_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The Type 1 is a meatgrinder of a weapon. This gas operated heavy machine gun can also be fielded as an anti-aircraft weapon. The Type 2 mortar is virtually identical to the Stokes-Brandt 81mm mortar with the only difference being that the bipod legs of the Type 2 can be removed."
 JAP_infantry_weapons2:0 "Model 2 submachine gun"
 JAP_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "Designed by famed arms designer Kijiro Nambu, the Model 2 is a blowback-operated submachine gun. One of Japan's first attempts at a submachine gun, the Model 2 features an incredible high rate of fire while also being light and portable. A pnuematic buffer device cushions the action of the gun and acts as a bolt delay."
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "100식"
 JAP_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "Type 100 is Japan's first mass-produced submachine gun. Although there are variants with bipods and increased sights for cavalry units, it is designed for infantry use. The gun fires 8mm at 450 rounds per minute. Interestingly some variants have been converted to folding stocks for use by army paratroopers."
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "100/44식"
 JAP_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "This 1944 modification of Type 100 includes several changes designed to simplify the weapon. The 1944 variant is longer than the earlier Type 100 with simple iron sights and a greatly simplified muzzle. The firing rate of the 1944 version is also considerably higher, with the gun firing at 800 rounds per minute. The gun is an absolute monster at close ranges with satisfactory accuracy and low recoil."

Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Lithuanian government."

The gun originated with a contest between Rheinmetall and Krupp, both of whom entered several designs that were all considered unsatisfactory for one reason or another. In the end the army decided the solution was to combine the best features of both designs, using the Rheinmetall gun on a Krupp carriage. In 1935 the Army drafted a requirement for a lightened version of the gun which could be towed by a single horse team in one piece, for which a new proposed design from Rheinmetall was selected."

In the field, the gun delivers great damage, but also has a great disadvantage of requiring a long period of time to tear down for transport. A notable innovation on the 17-cm K. 40 is the \"double recoil\" or dual-recoil carriage. The dual-recoil mechanism absorbs all of the recoil energy with virtually no movement of the box trail upon firing, thus making for a very accurate weapon."

The project was initially given low priority, but following the growing tensions with France and the appearance of heavily armoured tanks, it was given an increased priority. In terms of armour-piercing action, the Pa.K. 40 is superior to the similar guns, but have less effective rollback damping systems, as a result of which the gun is behind analogues to quickly change position."

However, once heavier tanks started to appear the design requirements were altered to include an anti-armour role. The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed. The high profile of the gun had to be maintained, which makes the gun extremely visible."

The Fla.K. 35 was only produced in small numbers, and production had already ended in 1936. Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute. A new, simplified sighting system introduced the next year led to the otherwise-identical 3,7-cm Fla.K. 37 which quickly became the main variant of the gun for the German Army."

The Rheinmetall Fla.K. 41 is a second generation 8,8-cm gun, which some generals say is 'almost equal to the 12,8-cm cannon'.

It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas.

This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg.

 NIC_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Krag–Jørgensen rifle was adopted by the United States in 1892 to replace the ageing Springfield Model 1884. While the Krags proved superior at close ranges to comparable Mauser designs in the Spanish-American war, the rifle's flimsy action in comparison to newer bolt designs necessitated a replacement a mere decade after its adoption. During the American occupations of several Central American nations in the early 20th century, many stockpiled Krag rifles, mostly of the 1898 rifle pattern, were given to local forces along with droves of surplus ammunition."

Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions.

 NZL_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor.

 POR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "A bolt action rifle with a long history of service, the 6,5 mm m/1904 is more commonly known by the moniker of 'Mauser-Vergueiro', as the main design of the gun is essentially that of the Mauser 98 (with a special bolt action mechanism heavily based on the Gewehr 1888) with the 6.5×58mm Vergueiro cartridge, one developed specifically for the portuguese variant. It became the official weapon of the Portuguese Army in 1904 and continued in that capacity until the 1940s, being widely used both at home and overseas. While it was not used by Portuguese troops in the western front, as those were armed by Entente, chiefly British, supplies, it saw extensive use in Africa from Portugal, its allies in South Africa, and was also used by Germans who occasionally captured supplies in Portuguese East Africa."

Its usage in Europe, while less famous, was far more widespread, but it was utterly supplanted by the FBP on later years."

As such, the nationalist Integralist junta supported the development of the C.A.P carbine intensely, but by the time it was ready for production, realities on the ground made it more worthwhile to switch to the FBP overall directly from the older Mauser-Vergueiro and variants already widely in use by the armed forces."

While its development started far before its widespread use among foot troops in Portugal's army, the finished model entered production too late to replace the Mauser-Vergueiro in the war. This intent was made clear by the submachine gun having, rather unusually, bayonet sockets compatible with those of the Mauser models used by Portugal throughout the conflicts of the previous decades. The so called 'machine gun pistol' (The term in Portuguese for submachine guns in general) saw extensive use throughout many years, albeit the 1945 variant fell out of use in favour of versions with semi-automatic firing and imported models, as the scale of warfare decreased in later decades after the Second Weltkrieg."
