 literature.10.d:0 "In his newest book, 'Existentialism Is a Humanism', Sartre explains the doctrine of Existentialism. For him, one of the key points is that the existence of a person comes before his or her essence. In simple terms, this means that, although a person exists, there is nothing to dictate that person's character, goals in life, and so on. Only the person themselves can define their essence."

 literature.12.d:0 "Our country's recent war has inspired many home comers to express their experiences in art, one of them being the author of a romance novel of unprecedented sales numbers.\n\nThe book, bearing the title \"Marin-chan to Kaigun-kun\", or \"Little Marin and the Sailor\", tells a story of two childhood friends and their tragic love: a boy and a girl growing up close to each other, partaking in a seemingly unchanging life. However, just when they finish high school, Japan is readying herself for war, and the boy is called to join the Navy. The two have to part from each other, Marin staying at home. Only now that they're separated, they notice their feelings for each other, but struggle to express them in the few letters they can exchange. Just when the war draws to a close, and Marin yearns for her loved one's return, his letters stop coming.\n\nWhile the book does not represent the highest of Japanese literature, it gives an astonishingly detailed insight to both the daily lives of a farmer's daughter in rural Japan and of a Japanese Navy Marine. The book is scheduled to be translated to German, English and Russian."

 literature.13.d:0 "미텔아프리카 출판사에서 나온 어린 왕자(\"Der Kleine Prinz\")라는 소설은 저자와 삽화가가 헤르만 괴링이라는 사실로 상당한 파문을 일으켰습니다. 이 단편소설에 작은 행성에 갇혀있는 어린 소년의 운명이 애정어린 마음으로 자세히 묘사되어 있습니다. 그는 케이크를 찾기위해 세계의 잔인함과 맞서야하지만, 우월한 프로이센식 훈련법으로 이를 극복할 수 있을 것입니다. \"미래 장병들의 방에서는 곧 이 책을 찾을 수 있을 것이다.\"라고 비평가들은 말했습니다."

 literature.14.d:0 "Ernst Jünger, one of our accomplished generals, is also a successful author. Today his newest book came out in the homeland: Auf den Marmorklippen, on the Marble Cliffs. It's a novel full of sometimes obscure symbolism, magic and the inner, hidden workings of life itself. Set in a fantasy world, the rich, art-loving civilisation of Marina is living in peace next to the martial nomads of the steppes. Two brothers are the protagonists of the story who try to stop the Oberförster, the Chief Ranger, from slowly overtaking the beautiful town of Marina. More and more nomads are listening to the Oberförster, who acts jovial it first, but soon proves to be a cold, power-hungry murderer. The people of Marina are stopping to listen to their poets, their values and spirit decay. When the two brothers find a cabin in the woods where the Oberförster's henchmen murder their victims, they try to rise up against the villain, but to no avail. Only their magic allows them to escape. They have to set fire to their house on the cliffs of marble and their life's work watching the city of Marina burn on the horizon, returning to a state of fatalism. The book has gained mixed reviews. While some praise it for its elaborate aesthetics and the insight in the way the world works, some readers more interested in the political implications of the Marmorklippen are wondering if it is supposed to be Ernst Jünger's commentary on the harsh reality of Mittelafrikan politics. Jünger himself didn't comment on it, but his brother Friedrich Georg, a poet, said that \"it's a shoe that fits various feet\"."

 literature.15.d:0 "The newest comic of Georges Rémi, or Hergé, takes place in the Qing Empire where the reporter Tintin is sent to dismantle drug trafficking. It is known that Hergé was helped in his work by a young student from the legation city of Shanghai named Zhang Chongren who came to [BEL.GetName] to study fine arts. The expertise of Zhang led to a striking and realistic representation of Chinese society and contributed greatly to the enormous success of the book both in Europe and China. The book criticises the weakness and the corruption of the Qing government as well as the Japanese presence in Manchuria and is as such, banned in both of these countries. Fortunately, the Kaiserreich allows free speech - it would have been a shame to miss this work of art!"

 literature.17.d.chi:0 "The people in Longyan were surprised when a young American man appeared and walked around the capital of our revolution, asking the locals questions about life here and our struggle.\n\nWhile his inquisitive behaviour seemed completely spontaneous and drew a lot of equally curious stares and wild gossip, it was actually the result of the hard work of our publicity department. The foreigner in question is Edgar Snow, an American journalist based in Shanghai, who came to Longyan to be the first Western writer to see our principles in practice first hand. With the help from our experienced scouts, he got safely across the frontlines. He spent his time here doing interviews with leadership figures, including Madame Sun and Wang Jingwei, but also with ordinary soldiers and common people on the streets. He was already quite sympathetic to our cause, and we made sure for him to see that our fight is just.\n\nToday his book hit the stores in the West and is already lauded by some as the scoop of the century. It will surely have a positive effect on our image in the eyes of the people of the world, despite whatever mean-spirited naysayers or apologists of imperialism may crow about bias."
