 POLITICS_LEWIS_BARROWS_DESC:0 "Born in Newport, Maine on June 7th, 1893 - Barrows studied in local schools around Newport before attending the University of Maine with a degree in pharmacy. His political career began to take off after holding local positions in Newport such as serving as the treasurer and as an eventual state committeeman under the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos in 1936, Maine remained unscathed from much of the violence and Barrows made sure that Maine would remain free from radicalism under his leadership as Maine Secretary of State.\n\nWith the arrival of the second civil war among the states of the former United States of America, Barrows along with prominent New England politicians and governors were among those who appealed to Canada for protection. Representing what is left of the Republican Party, Barrows has been nominated to serve as an interim president in the hopes of securing the eventual restoration of American democracy. Serving alongside President Barrows is Vice President Henry Styles Bridges, the former governor of New Hampshire. A teacher and businessman, Styles Bridges was the youngest state governor of the time and now is eager to join Barrows' administration."
 POLITICS_DAVID_WALSH_DESC:0 "Born in Leominster, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1872 - Walsh attended local public schools in his youth before attending Boston University Law school, after which he was admitted to the bar. Rising to politics in a longtime Republican district as a Democrat, Walsh proposed increased government responsibility for charity work and the mentally ill and pushed for censorship of the racist film "Birth of a Nation." Indeed, Walsh is a staunch opponent of the racism that pervades American society; in the 1924 Democratic National Convention, he condemned the Ku Klux Klan. A champion of modern labour standards, Walsh has found a robust voting base among the working classes of New England.\n\nNoted for his political populism and seemingly luxurious lifestyle, Walsh served successful terms as Massachusetts's first Irish-Catholic senator. When the great civil war broke out, Walsh quickly ascended to the head of the Democratic Party in New England. A prominent advocate of isolation during the Weltkrieg, Walsh has attracted the annoyance of his Canadian neighbours due to his anti-imperialist views. While Canadian-American ties are ever closer, Walsh's anti-interventionist stances will surely bring conflict between the two nations.\n\nServing alongside President Walsh is none other than former Rhode Island Senator Theodore Green. A vigorous member of the Democratic Party despite his age, Green stands opposed to Walsh's isolationism - instead of believing that America's path lies in aiding the rest of the free world."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_JR_DESC:0 "Born in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1884 - Joseph Martin Jr came from an Irish New England family and spent his youth playing ball and working as a newspaper editor. A so-called "compassionate conservative," Martin supports the use of conservative techniques and concepts to significantly improve society's welfare.\n\nAscending from a career of local and then state politics for Massachusetts, Martin secured a position in Congress as a Representative for the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos and a new interim President was hastily chosen, Martin was elected on a combined coalition party of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHis Vice President is the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts and conservative Democrat Joseph B. Ely. Achieving fame among New Englanders due to his handling of the Great Depression, Ely has been chosen by the compromise committee due to his role in combating unemployment and poverty. While the tensions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party still exist, a house divided against itself cannot stand in America's darkest hour."
 POLITICS_WILBUR_CROSS_DESC:0 "Born in Mansfield, Connecticut in 1862 - Cross is renowned across the American literary scene for his talented work in analyzing English literature. From academia, Cross competed for the position of governorship for the state of Connecticut of which he won successfully. With the outbreak of the civil war, Cross finds himself in a precarious position following the Canadian occupation of New England. One of the many Americans who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene, Cross's openness to embrace the Entente's arrival into America has led some to suspect that he is no more than a mere puppet of the former British Empire. While he is on paper the leader of a provisional government led by Ottawa, he is also the temporary interim leader of New England until a suitable President is chosen."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_HURLEY_DESC:0 "Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 24th, 1893 - Hurley's early life was marked with tragedy as he lost both his parents at a young age. He was then raised by the family housekeeper, a former US District Attorney, before attending Boston College and becoming a salesman in athletic goods. Hurley then embarked on a career in local politics before ascending to the position of Massachusetts State Treasurer for three consecutive terms as a Democrat. The success of his political run convinced him of greater political aspirations, and he ran successfully for governor in the 1936 election. As the nation descended into chaos, the Irish-American governor sought to resolve tensions between Yankee Protestants and Irish-American Catholics. In the wake of the destructive 1938 New England Hurricane, Hurley oversaw the relief and rebuilding efforts for the city of Boston.\n\nNow the newly elected 33rd President of the United States finds himself in a much greater position, the defender of American democracy in the wake of radicals and reactionaries. Serving alongside Hurley is fellow Democrat Peter Gerry, a wealthy senator from the state of Rhode Island. Gerry was tutored and mentored by none other than Canadian politician William Lyon Mackenzie King in his youth."
 POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "Born on the East Side of New York City on February 23, 1889 - John Winant came from a prosperous family and attended Princeton University, although his marks were relatively poor. After a brief stint in the army, Winant entered state politics by elected to the New Hampshire Senate. Following a successful career in the Senate, Winant ascended to Governor of New Hampshire under the Republican Party from 1925-1927 and then from 1931-1935. He achieved state-wide fame for his handling of the decades-long economic depression that had beset America. Active in the Square Deal policies that helped end the depression in New England, Winant has easily been chosen among his party to lead New England onwards in its most challenging days. Following his governorship, Winant ascended to the powerful position of being the American ambassador to Canada where he played a hand in the many interactions between the Provisional Government and the Canadian nation. The 33rd President of the United States faces a broken nation but is eager to reunite and take its place once more as the hegemon of the New World.\n\nServing alongside Winant is Frederick Hale, a Maine lawyer and Senator from Harvard University. A long-time Republican and chairman of the Committee of Canadian Relations - Hale has espoused fierce anti-Ku Klux Klan views in public and has not been afraid to denounce them."
 POLITICS_RAYMOND_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Born in Rye, New York on August 31, 1893 - Raymond Baldwin's home state became Connecticut after moving there at a young age and spending his college years at Yale. Baldwin participated in the Stratford Town Court as a prosecutor, eventually advancing to judge of the town court in 1931. As the country fell apart, the governor of Connecticut, Baldwin, was among those who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene due to the civil war. To ensure the safety of the people of New England, Baldwin supervised a complex array of civil defenses and statewide services on the homefront which grew his popularity within the Republican Party. He certainly has his work cut out for him as the nation reels from the horror of the great war - only time will tell whether or not Baldwin's hand will lead to prosperity and peace in the future.\n\nServing alongside Baldwin, New Yorker Irving Ives, a man whose family dates back to the first settlers who settled in New England. Re-elected many times in the New York State Assembly, Ives publicly expressed his desire to end workplace discrimination based on race, creed, and colour. Together, both men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Republican Party."
 POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 22, 1901 - Tobin's Catholic and Irish heritage has led him to become deeply popular among Boston's Irish population. He briefly worked at Conway Leather and New England Telephone after graduating from Boston University until he entered politics as a protege of the esteemed Democrat James Michael Curley. At just the young age of 25, Tobin was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, which he served from 1925-1929. A fiscally conservative man, Tobin then became mayor of Boston serving the city without authorizing large public scale projects. His career as mayor was rocked by the Coconut Grove fire, but the scandal did not stop the ambitious Tobin from running for President. An energetic and vigorous member of the Democratic Party, Tobin became elected as the 34th President, securing for the Democrats four more years in the White House. The nation waits to see what the new President will do, especially those involved in labour as Tobin has been a constant supporter of labour unions and socially liberal policies.\n\nServing alongside Tobin is James Farley, an Irish-Catholic New Yorker and member of the Knights of Malta. A fierce fighter for civil rights, especially for African-Americans, Farley has announced he will supervise the rebuilding of the nation's postal service and significantly improve its airmail capabilities. The two men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Democratic Party."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Born in New York City on November 15, 1891 - William Harriman, also known as \"Averell\" Harriman, was born into a life of wealth as his father was railroad baron E.H. Harriman. During his academic career at Groton School and Yale University, Harriman made contacts that led to the large firm \"Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.\" During the 1930s, Harriman's properties grew to include the Union Pacific Railroad, the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, and the Polaroid Corporation. His immense wealth painted Harriman as an enemy in the eyes of the Syndicalists during the years leading up to the civil war. During the ensuing chaos, Harriman fled north for the Provisional Government of New England, where he joined the Committee of Canadian-American Relations and helped coordinate the joint war effort between New England and Canada. Through this position, Harriman gained the experience necessary to become the American ambassador to Canada - helping aid in the close relations between the two nations.\n\nReceiving the nomination of the Democratic Party and following his victory in the 1948 election, Harriman has become the 35th President of the United States of America. The new President has a lot of work cut out for him as the full signs of recovery are beginning to show, and the years of reconstruction are finally coming to an end. Serving alongside Harriman will be the former governor of New York state, Herbert H. Lehman. A supporter of the Second Square Deal during the provisional government era, Lehman has publicly stated his support for the guaranteed rights and wages of the working class."
 POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Born in Dummerston, Vermont, on August 20th, 1892 - Aiken developed a strong interest in agriculture early, a passion that he would carry on in his career as governor of Vermont. A Republican, he ran unsuccessfully for the Vermont House of Representatives in 1922, but he ran successfully in 1930 and 1932. He ascended to the position of Lieutenant Governor in 1934 and became governor in 1936, just as the nation descended into chaos. As governor of Vermont during the civil war, Aiken helped organise work projects to alleviate the economic stress caused by years of the great depression. A proponent of spending projects for rural America, Aiken holds great affection for the natural beauty of his home state, although these views put him at odds with old-guard Republicans. With his background in agriculture, he portrayed himself as the defender of farmers and the common folk - with this stance and popularity, he accepted the Republican nomination for the campaign of 1948.\n\nNow the 35th President of the United States, Aiken faces a nation finally shaking off the dust after years of economic woe and instability. Serving alongside Aiken is Robert Bradford, the Republican Lt. Governor of Boston, and a man from a long-time traditional New England family. During his time as governor, Bradford emphasised fiscal conservatism but social liberal values as seen in his project such as housing and care for civil war veterans."
 POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "Born in Owosso, Michigan, on March 24, 1902 - Thomas E. Dewey attended the University of Michigan, where he briefly contemplated a career in singing. After a throat ailment convinced him a job in such was risky, Dewey instead pursued law which brought him to New York City. First serving as a federal prosecutor, Dewey achieved headlines in the 1930s by prosecuting gangster Waxey Gordon. With an excellent memory, Dewey used his details of crimes and telephone taps to bring down criminal organisations. Unfortunately for Dewey, however, the great civil war forced him to flee from New York City and head north to New England, where he would serve as governor in 1942, 1946, and 1950. Regarded as an honest and effective governor, Dewey banned racial discrimination in employment and increased state aid for education and salaries for state employees. His Postwar "Reconstruction Fund" helped the city of New York recover after years of brutal civil war that had utterly devastated the metropolis, and with such fame, he achieved the Republican nomination in 1952.\n\nSecuring the election of 1952, Dewey is now the 36th President of the United States and leads a mighty America, years of civil war and instability long behind her. Serving alongside him is the grandson of the legendary American oil baron John Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller. A noted art collector, businessman, and politician, Rockefeller has been noted for his liberal and progressive views despite his Republican background."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_BOWLES_DESC:0 "Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on April 5th, 1901 - Bowles came from a Republican family who hated and feared big government. However, Bowles' political views were shaped by his aunt Ruth Standish Baldwin, a socialist and friend of Norman Thomas. After graduating from Yale University, Bowles became an advertising executive, although he was forced to flee from New York City due to the arrival of the civil war. Initially opposed to Canada's involvement in American politics, Bowles joined the America First Committee, although he voiced his support for New England after the provisional government entered the fray. After the civil war, Bowles led the Office of Economic Stabilisation, using his years in economics to help rebuild the nation's war-torn economy. In 1948, he became governor of Connecticut, defeating James C. Shannon signed the end of segregated national guard units and acts to improve mental health and housing.\n\nNow the 36th President of the United States, after securing the election of 1952, Bowles plans to lead a new America, one willing to help develop the world's weaker nations. Realizing America's restored industrial and military might be better used to serve the world, Bowles will push for greater American world involvement to keep the peace. Paul Dever, the governor of Massachusetts and a former Lt. Commander in the Civil War, will be serving alongside Bowles. The youngest ever Attorney General of Massachusetts, Dever's governorship saw mental health reforms and efforts to resist domestic syndicalism."
