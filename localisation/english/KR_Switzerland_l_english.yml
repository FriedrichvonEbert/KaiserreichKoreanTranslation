 POLITICS_SWITZERLAND_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "1848년에 설립된 스위스 연방의회는 스위스의 국가원수 역할을 하는 7명의 집행위원회입니다. 각 의원은 7개의 다른 연방 부서 중 하나를 이끌고, 연방 대통령의 직책은 매년 7명의 의원들 사이에서 이동하며, 현 해의 부통령은 다음 해의 대통령으로서 임명됩니다."
 POLITICS_BIRCHER_DESC:0 "A Germanophile and diehard anti-Syndicalist, Eugen Bircher is a physician by trade and invented several groundbreaking procedures dealing with arthroscopy of the knee. After the rise of Syndicalism in France Bircher largely gave up his medical work and founded the SVV, which quickly pervaded Swiss military and political circles as a counterbalance to the rising tide of Socialism in the nation."
 POLITICS_SWI_UNION_DESC:0 "The Federal Union Council is the temporary governmental body of the Swiss Syndicalist state after the overthrow of the government, dedicated to the stabilisation and reformation of the Swiss nation."
 POLITICS_EXECUTIVE_DIRECTORY_DESC:0 "The Executive Directory acts as the permanent Helvetic Head of State in the wake of the revolution, occupying a similar position to the Federal Council of old, but with more executive power vested in the Directory to allow for more decisive action to be taken in times of crisis."
 POLITICS_HERZOG_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_GENEVA_DESC:0 "The temporary movement of the capital to Geneva has placed the burden of governance on the current Geneva Council of State, which has taken over control of the nation until a more permanent office can be created to guide the nation."
 POLITICS_SWI_HENRI_GUISAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 21st, 1874\nMézières, Vaud, Switzerland\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in a French-speaking part of Switzerland, Guisan originally attended school and studied agricultural medicine. However, after entering the Swiss military in 1894, he has gradually climbed the ranks, and was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1932, the highest rank in peacetime. Guisan participates in politics less than many of his peers, and views the best path forward as neutrality by deterrence, supporting strong and elaborate defences to make conquering Switzerland a long and painful feat."
 POLITICS_SWI_EUGEN_BIRCHER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 17th, 1882\nAarau, Aargau, Switzerland\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nAlong with Henri Guisan, Bircher occupies the highest rank of the Swiss military available during peacetime. However, unlike his equal, he spends much of his time in politics, spearheading a semi-secret far-right organisation with great influence in the Swiss government."

 SWI_the_government_has_failed_desc:0 "현재의 스위스 정부 형태는 우리를 둘러싸고 있는 독수리들로부터 스위스를 보호하는 데 취약하고 효과적이지 않다는 것을 증명했습니다. 스위스가 자유롭고 독립적인 국가로 계속 유지되려면 과감한 정부 개혁과 강력한 지도력이 필요합니다."
 SWI_one_people_desc:0 "스위스 사람들은 너무 오랫동안 우리 이웃의 뜻에 굴복하여 그들의 언어로 말을 했습니다. 이제 스위스는 이러한 외국어를 버리고 스위스의 유일한 진정한 언어인 독일어로만 공식적인 업무를 수행해야 합니다."
 SWI_swiss_french_alliance_desc:0 "프랑스 코뮌에서 오는 압도적인 외교적 압력에 유럽의 다른 강대국들은 코뮌의 힘에 대항하는 것을 두려워합니다. 생디칼리스트의 물결은 막을 수 없습니다. 우리는 프랑스에게 자진해서 굴복한 다음에 피할 수 없는 상황에 함께 흘러가는 것이 낫습니다."
 SWI_geneva_avenged_desc:0 "몇 년 전, 제네바의 용감한 노동자들은 그들의 권리와 자유를 주장했지만, 오래된 자본주의 정권에 의해 잔인하게 무너졌습니다. 이제 우리는 우리의 사랑하는 생디칼리슴 스위스의 토대를 마련하기 위해 목숨을 바친 영웅들을 기리려 합니다."
 SWI_national_defense_desc:0 "스위스의 국가정신은 외국의 침략에 맞서는 강력한 방어에 초점을 맞추고 있습니다. 스위스 사람들은 제국주의 야망을 위해 싸우지 않고, 이웃과 집을 지키기 위해 싸웁니다."
 SWI_beat_back_french_desc:0 "프랑스와 싸우기 위해 국가의 보루에서 위치를 지키고, 병력을 집결시켜 대규모 반격을 가할 때입니다. 일단 그들을 격퇴하면, 우리는 독일 동맹국들과 협력하여 코뮌의 영토로 전진할 수 있습니다."
 SWI_austrian_assisstance_desc:0 "우리의 원조 요청에 대해 오스트리아 제국은 이에 대응하고 프랑스의 침략에 맞서 우리의 주권을 지키겠다고 약속했습니다. 오스트리아와 같은 강대국의 도움으로, 우리는 프랑스 침략자들에게 더 강력히 대항할 수 있습니다."

 SWI_new_government_desc:0 "Over 600 years ago our ancestors gathered on the Rütli to swear the oath of the Swiss Confederacy. Now, on the eve of our rebirth, we must gather representatives from the Unions across Switzerland to swear a new oath, one forming the foundation of the new Syndicalist age."
 SWI_national_unions_desc:0 "Outside of Romandie, Syndicalist Unions have failed to make significant gains politically and are struggling with their newfound power. We must support and officially recognise the authority these Unions now have in the government."
 SWI_gotthard_desc:0 "Fortress St. Gotthard forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
 SWI_maurice_desc:0 "Fortress St. Maurice forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
 SWI_Sargans_desc:0 "Fortress Sargans forms one of the three main defensive fortifications that make up the defensive network stretching across Switzerland. While strong, this network is still in need of improvements and repairs. Updating these fortresses is a key step in maintaining a strong defensive stance."
 SWI_retreat_redoubt_desc:0 "The betrayal of the Romandie Cantons and the advance of the French forces has put us in an unfavourable position. We cannot hope to hold the line at the border, it is best that our military retreat to our prepared defences in the National Redoubt as we regroup and prepare our counterattack."
 SWI_cultivation_battle_desc:0 "Switzerland is not a nation blessed with an abundance of natural resources. For centuries Swiss farmers have fought a battle against the harsh mountain climates to grow enough crops to feed the nation. Now that war looms on the horizon, we must subsidise these farmers to make Switzerland self-sufficient."
 SWI_bircher_plan_desc:0 "Colonel Eugen Bircher has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves pursuing a more traditional war with a larger army and a central, mobile force that would seek set-piece battles. Choosing this plan would commit the nation to fighting a war centred around a mobile army with as many offensive moves as defensive."
 SWI_guisan_plan_desc:0 "Colonel Henri Guisan has put forth a plan to defend the nation that involves a stoic defence and continued usage of the pre-prepared fallback lines and fortresses that would ensure a campaign of guerrilla warfare throughout our nation. Accepting his plan would mean moving forward with a plan to fight a purely defensive war."
 SWI_man_borders_desc:0 "We must first activate the civilian Border Guard units and flood our outer defences with soldiers in a show of force against outside aggression. The Swiss people will flock in droves to our defence, and only the staunchest of foes would dare break themselves upon our walls."
 SWI_guisan_speech_desc:0 "What the troops need to perform effectively is a strong leader who will lead them through the darkness to victory. Henri Guisan is prepared to be that man, and has gathered a large amount of soldiers to inspire with his words."
 SWI_bullet_or_bayonet_desc:0 "If Switzerland is to fall to foreign aggressors, she will not go down without a fight. By bullet or by bayonet the Swiss people will fight for every inch of land and throw our enemies back from our lands."
 SWI_resist_to_the_end_desc:0 "Even after the battles are lost and are armies driven from the field, our enemies can not rest easy. It is the duty of the Swiss people to resist in everything they do, and to stop the enemy in every way they can."
 SWI_ski_divisions_desc:0 "The Swiss Ski Divisions have a mastery of the Alpine terrain and should be moved into a single, cohesive unit capable of making a decisive strike against our enemies. Properly equipping and expanding these forces will give us a powerful tool to use in the fights to come."
 SWI_mountineer_defense_desc:0 "The best defence is a good offence. It is not good enough to simply sit behind or lines. We must make active manoeuvres and strike at the enemy whenever we are given an opportunity, so that we may eventually drive him from our lands entirely."
 SWI_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Swiss Air Force has not seen a major change in composition since the end of the Weltkrieg. Our planes are old and decrepit, and in drastic need of an overhaul. We must begin an immediate modernisation of our air force so as not to be left behind."
 SWI_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Our continued cooperation with the Germans and integration of our economic and military command structures have pushed us ever closer into the German sphere. Our ties are so great that it seems almost unthinkable to sever our ties with Germany, even if we may desire it. We are already a de facto member of the German sphere, and the time has come to formally join the Reichspakt as a proper member state."
 SWI_national_bank_desc:0 "The Swiss National Bank is the strong economic arm of the entire country, handling the finances of the vast majority of the population and the government alike. Subsidising and assisting the bank in its operations, and allowing for bank secrecy when dealing with account holder funds, will serve to boost the economy as we recover from the Black Monday disaster."
 SWI_free_our_skies_desc:0 "Our terrestrial defences are strong, but can be easily weakened in the face of enemy air superiority. We should focus heavily on maintaining air superiority in order to keep our enemies at bay."
 SWI_alpine_rhine_desc:0 "Our border with Austria is complicated by rivers and mountains that make traversing the terrain slow and difficult. Expansion of these passages between our two nations will enhance the Austrian's ability to send troops and materials to our aid when advancing westwards into the Commune."
 SWI_economic_routes_desc:0 "The conflict with France has severed many of our traditional routes of supply. As a landlocked nation, we rely heavily on land routes through friendly nations in order to receive the resources we need for survival. We must expand these network in order to fuel our war effort and maintain the flow of goods."
 SWI_new_fighters_desc:0 "It is not enough to copy the designs of other nation's militaries. Funding a new initiative to design a truly Swiss fighter will reduce our dependence on foreign militaries for supplies and equipment."
 SWI_international_aid_desc:0 "Our own forces are insufficient, but we hold the moral high ground in this obviously unwarranted conflict. By pleading with every nation that will listen for aid, maybe we can scrape together enough assistance to turn the tide."
 SWI_formalize_volunteers_desc:0 "With a new flow of foreign volunteers established, it is now only a matter of organising this trickle of able-bodied men into cohesive fighting units. Mixing these volunteer units with proper Swiss soldiers will strengthen their backbone and improve their organisation the battlefield."
 SWI_hold_the_line_desc:0 "Even without a world power on our side, we must still find a way to hold the line against the French aggressors. We cannot win alone, so we must use every advantage available to us to survive long enough for foreign intervention to save the day."
 SWI_german_military_tactics_desc:0 "Joining our military command with Germany's has taught us that our own military tactics are woefully behind the times. The new doctrine of the German Army can be taught to our troops in order to bring our troops up to our Ally's standards."
 SWI_mountain_airfields_desc:0 "The lofty peaks of the Swiss Alps provide many areas for us to construct new airfields for military use. The altitude of these airfields will make them difficult for the enemy to seize or destroy in war."
 SWI_air_academy_desc:0 "Our air force is lacking in trained pilots and serviceable planes. In light of this crisis, we must take advantage of every possible plane we can get our hands on. One proposition is to nationalise all civilian planes and recruit their pilots, mechanics, and radiomen into our own air force."
 SWI_cross_the_border_desc:0 "We should look to use our air force not only as a defensive force, but also as a force capable of striking deep into enemy territory. Performing these cross-border raids into enemy territory will let our enemies know that we are capable of more than simple defensive actions."
 SWI_mountain_aa_desc:0 "The mountainous terrain of the Alps creates a multitude of areas where we can create new defensive AA emplacements to defend our skies. Such a network of emplaced defences will make any air force rethink their plans to invade our airspace."
 SWI_new_swiss_army_desc:0 "Through reform and new military leadership, the Swiss Army of today is all but unrecognisable compared to the army that marched in drill but a few short years ago. This new army is tough, veteran, and ready to take on the world."
 SWI_coal_mines_desc:0 "The National Coal Mines provide the strong economic foundation on which the Swiss economy is built. Expanding their operations will increase our economic output exponentially."
 SWI_reverse_economic_downturn_desc:0 "After the disastrous hit to our economy that was Black Monday, it has become clear the government needs to take immediate action in order to save the Swiss economy from suffering a complete meltdown."
 SWI_war_profiteering_desc:0 "Our neighbour's losses are our gains. Selling weapons to our neighbours as they kill each other in senseless conflict can only serve to strengthen our own position when the time comes to fight."
 SWI_economic_sufficiency_desc:0 "All aspects of the Swiss economy rely heavily on foreign imports in order to survive. We must work to move as many industries as possible inside of our own borders to reduce our reliance on foreign powers and encourage our economy to rely on internal sources for production."
 SWI_liscense_foregin_designs_desc:0 "Foreign aircraft have proven to be deadly and effective in recent wars. Our own aircraft industry is in its infancy. Perhaps the best idea is to instead licence foreign designs rather than having to spend valuable resources researching our own Swiss aircraft."
 SWI_trans_alpine_tunnels_desc:0 "The tunnels running beneath the Alps form a powerful economic lifeline that cross through the centre of Europe. Expanding these tunnels will increase our ability to profit from our control of these railways."
 SWI_promote_franc_desc:0 "The economic systems of our neighbours have seen disastrous free falls in the wake of Black Monday. This has affected the strengths of their currencies, and confidence in the financial markets has fallen. Promoting the Swiss franc as the viable alternative to the failing German mark will serve to boost our own economy in the face of this economic crisis."
 SWI_sell_war_bonds_desc:0 "Promotion of the Swiss Franc has begun boosting our economy, but the government is still heavily in debt. We must turn to the people in order to support the government in the face of war."
 SWI_strategic_services_desc:0 "As a small nation in the centre of Europe, we cannot hope to win on strength alone. We must found a new intelligence service that can solve our problems before they can snowball out of control, and give us powerful intelligence on the moves of our enemies."
 SWI_electronics_research_desc:0 "Developed as a replacement for the ageing German ciphers used by the Swiss Army prior to the Second Weltkrieg, the NEMA represents the nation's interests in ensuring that no other nation no matter how friendly, can read our mail."
 SWI_issues_of_the_day_desc:0 "For many issues of public importance in Switzerland, the people are allowed to vote in nation-wide referendums, where the outcome is determined by popular vote. Focusing our efforts on these issues will ensure that we tackle the societal problems that people find important in their daily lives."
 SWI_vienna_circle_desc:0 "The Austrians have recently made overtures to other nations close to them to participate in the Vienna Circle, a centre of technological advancement and learning in the heart of the Austrian Empire. Joining such a programme would no doubt allow us to enjoy the fruit of these technological advancements."
 SWI_strengthen_ties_desc:0 "Our continued relationship with Austria in our fight against Syndicalism is the lifeline keeping our nation from total collapse. We must make moves to ensure that this relationship holds for as long as we face a common foe."
 SWI_an_official_alliance_desc:0 "While we are de-facto in an alliance with our wartime ally Austria, it has become necessary to make the alliance a formal relationship. Austria commands the loyalty of a larger network of nations, and joining this web as a formal participant can only serve to strengthen our position."
 SWI_german_tech_sharing_desc:0 "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society is Germany's foremost centre of technological advancements and research. Applying for membership in such a prestigious collaboration effort will improve our ability to field a technologically advanced military force."
 SWI_never_again_desc:0 "The Geneva Strikes of the early 1930s were caused by a failing and inefficient government. We have made steps to reform that government, but there are many who seek protections against such a tragedy ever occurring again. Thus the Syndicalist Unions are to be given their own military powers, so that the power rests solely in the hands of the Trade Unions."
 SWI_the_peoples_republic_desc:0 "The people of Switzerland have made their wills clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by a government too strong for its own good, and too disconnected from the people, wallowing in its capitalist greed. Thus a new government must be formed, a government run solely by the people, and for the people."
 SWI_totalitarian_regime_desc:0 "The people of Switzerland have made their will clear. The crimes and failings of the past were caused by lack of protection from foreign influences. The common people cannot defend against such aggression by themselves. Thus a strong state is necessary to safeguard the nation's future comrades. For we are the only thing standing between you and them."
 SWI_loyalty_to_the_state_desc:0 "We must encourage loyalty to the state whenever possible, so that we may foster both a populace and a military that values the strength of the government and its ability to protect the people."
 SWI_consolidate_power_desc:0 "There are dissenting voices still within the government and in the streets that oppose the takeover of the government by loyal nationalist forces. These voices are muted, for now, but a consolidation is necessary if we are to identify and \"rectify\" those who still have misguided views on the government in Switzerland."
 SWI_fortress_defense_desc:0 "If our enemies are so keen to attack us in our homes, then we will make such a network of interconnected fortifications that the very idea of assaulting Switzerland will fill the enemy with dread, as they imagine the many millions it will take to gain even a single kilometre of our land."
 SWI_expansionist_military_desc:0 "Only through show of arms can we secure our nation's future. To this end, it is important that we instil a strong sense of national pride in all citizens of the nation, so that they will fight to the bitter end to defend their home and their state."
 SWI_nuclear_program_desc:0 "The Study Commission for Nuclear Energy's purpose is to investigate the use of both nuclear power in providing for our nation's energy needs, and to evaluate the requirements for the advancement of a weaponised nuclear programme for the defence of the nation."
 SWI_uranium_mine_desc:0 "Switzerland is a small state compared to the titans of Europe. Thus we find it necessary to defend ourselves with all means available to us, even if we must bathe the continent in nuclear fire to achieve our goals."
 SWI_expand_our_operations_desc:0 "With the world falling to chaos, the Military Intelligence Service must be called upon again and again to undertake more dangerous and more dubious tasks to defend the nation. Expanding their areas of influence and operational capacities will help them resolve whatever problem comes their way. No matter how unsavoury."
 SWI_motorization_desc:0 "Our military is almost entirely composed of foot infantry and horse-drawn support. Our troops are slow to move and our supplies even slower to arrive. It is important that we invest in motorisation to keep our troops from fighting the next war with the last war's equipment."
 SWI_armor_experiments_desc:0 "The Nahkampfkanone, an experimental Swiss AT Destroyer, has shown great promise in its initial field tests. This project has shown that we are capable of designing our own armoured vehicles, and that we should continue to invest in similar projects."
 SWI_mechanised_brigades_desc:0 "Our initial motorisation efforts have proved most successful, but there is still more to do. In Germany, new mechanised Leichte Brigaden have begun to show promise as the fighting force of the future, and it is only wise that we follow in their footsteps and invest in our own mechanised forces."
 SWI_new_academy_desc:0 "In the interwar period, our fighters relied on an informal school of training that involved local instructors and wildly differing levels of competence. Now that the Air Force is being reformed into a strong and professional force, we must take care to standardise our pilot training school to improve the quality of our pilots nationwide."
 SWI_new_tactics_desc:0 "Bambini-Code is a brevity code recently developed to allow for easy communication between our fighter squadrons in the heat of combat. Its use has proven wildly effective, and promoting and requiring its use among our pilots will drastically improve their ability to perform against their counterparts."
 SWI_bombers_desc:0 "The establishment of the Surveillance Squadrons will allow us to gain intelligence through fighter patrols in and around our borders while also maintaining a large nighttime presence."
 SWI_air_factories_desc:0 "Flugzeugwerk Emmen is the nation's first dedicated aircraft factory, and is designed to construct the first of many planes in the Swiss Air Force."
 SWI_strategic_bombing_desc:0 "The acceleration of our previous raiding campaigns have taught us that if we are to continue, we must invest in large strategic bombing forces. These forces will allow us to project our power across the continent while maintaining our air force entirely within the confines of Switzerland."
 SWI_defensive_constructions_desc:0 "Our previous projects have given us extensive experience and knowledge in the proper construction and design of fortifications. We can take advantage of this knowledge and create new defensive networks wherever they are needed."
 SWI_new_roadways_desc:0 "Our nation is one with twisting roadways and extensive railways that connect cities separated by large mountain ranges. It is important that we update and maintain our extensive rail networks so that we may move goods and soldiers around the nation as easily as possible. Electrifying tour rail lines with power from our hydroelectric dams will ensure they run as efficiently as possible."
 SWI_develop_cantons_desc:0 "We must make a concerted effort to develop all regions of the nation equally. To this end, we must allow the Cantons autonomy in their own development and construction of infrastructure, as well as to empower the Bureau of Mining of the Federal War, Industry and Employment Office to create a national survey of the nation's natural resources for exploitation."
 SWI_canton_improvement_desc:0 "Switzerland is a nation with few national resources of its own. Swiss Steel is one of the few Steel corporations operating inside of the country. If Switzerland is to become self-sufficient in Steel production, we will need to fund their efforts."
 SWI_swiss_seas_desc:0 "Switzerland is a traditionally landlocked nation with no direct access to the high seas, however, this does not prevent us from fielding a fleet of our own. Whether it is a militarised navy or one of maritime commerce, the Swiss will sail the seas as proud as any other nation on earth."
 SWI_military_factories_desc:0 "Oerlikon-Bührle is the largest producer of arms and artillery in the nation. Their weapons constitute almost half of our nations arms exports, and giving them valued government subsidies will not only increase their productivity but ensure our soldiers are equipped with the highest quality weapons."
 SWI_final_factories_desc:0 "The war is becoming a large drain on our stockpiles of arms and ammunition. Our trade with foreign powers is not only insufficient, but unreliable. We must transition not only our industrial quarters but all parts of our society to a war footing if we are to produce enough weapons to last the conflict."
 SWI_expanding_the_shipyards_desc:0 "Our military adventures have found us currently in possession of several large shipyards. These shipyards, the first in our nation's history, could be used to produce the large blue-water navy that the Swiss people have only ever dreamed of."
 SWI_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Investing into a strong military navy would be a waste. By the time hostilities have ended, our navy will still be in its infancy. Meanwhile, we could instead use this time to invest heavily into our merchant marine, the voyages of which could directly impact our international trade and bring back tidy profits."
 SWI_military_navy_desc:0 "Rather than wasting our time focusing on trade, we should instead use our new naval facilities to facilitate the creation of a completely new Swiss Navy, one which can fight the navies of the other world powers."
 SWI_seaborne_trade_routes_desc:0 "The Swiss economy is on an upswing that will last for years to come. Now that we have sea access, it is our best interests to keep this momentum and begin investing into nautical trade routes to expand our wealth."
 SWI_center_of_commerce_desc:0 "Our continued investment into the merchant marine and maritime trade, combined with the strong state of the Swiss economy, has allowed our ports to be known as strong centres of trade worldwide, with the economic gains from these cities flowing freely into our treasury."
 SWI_independent_navy_desc:0 "The Lakes Flotilla of Switzerland now finds itself in possession of all of the facilities and materiel necessary to form a proper naval force. This newly created Swiss Navy must quickly adapt itself to combat on the high seas, or be sunk."
 SWI_naval_bombers_desc:0 "A combination of research into traditional bomber forces and naval innovations, the new Swiss naval bombers will drastically increase our ability to project power across the waves."
 SWI_coastal_defense_desc:0 "While we move forward with our transition to a fully blue water navy, it is still of vital importance that we support the Lakes Flotilla, for they protect the waterways in and around Switzerland from outside aggression."
 SWI_naval_officers_desc:0 "Switzerland's naval activities in previous years has consisted only of merchant marine sailors and the brown water Lakes Flotilla. We must take these few experienced men we can, and use them to train the next generation of proud Swiss sailors for our navy."
 SWI_ship_designs_desc:0 "While we have come into the possession of new naval facilities, a first for this formerly landlocked state, we cannot move forward with a fleet without first investing in ship designs. Switzerland's naval tradition is small, and thus we must move forward to design a new fleet of ships as soon as possible to begin our training."
 SWI_first_vessel_desc:0 "After several gruelling months of work, it is time for great celebration as the Swiss Navy officially christens its first ocean going naval vessel. The EKS Helvetia is the first of many in the new Swiss Fleet, and will serve as our first flagship as the Swiss Navy joins the great oceangoing fleets of this age."
 SWI_beneath_the_waves_desc:0 "While we have found ourselves in possession of large naval facilities and dockyards, it is not feasible to create a large traditional fleet. Instead we should focus on cheap and efficient submarines, so that we can project power without the decades-long investments a surface fleet requires."
 SWI_surface_fleet_desc:0 "Our nation was formerly a landlocked state, one that could not properly project its power on the high seas. Now we find ourselves in the possession of multiple dockyards, and as an ascendant naval power. It is our duty to create a surface fleet that can go toe-to-toe with the old powers."
 SWI_peace_at_last_desc:0 "We have made it through the Savoyard Crisis with no Swiss blood being shed. We have realised that violence is not always the answer, and maintaining our neutrality in the face of conflict is what makes us strong. We can move forward from this crisis as a newer and stronger nation."
 SWI_french_mission_desc:0 "The source of the crisis in Haute-Savoie was our extremely sour relations with our large neighbour, the Commune of France. We have had poor relations for over a decade, and it is time for this era of rivalry to end. We will send a diplomatic mission to Paris to try and hammer out a diplomatic solution to our confrontations and try and befriend France, rather than fight them."
 SWI_embrace_neutrality_desc:0 "The Swiss people are known far and wide as a people who value the strength of neutrality. Having survived the Savoyard Crisis without surrendering our values, we have proven that neutrality is a virtue. We should embrace this philosophy across the nation."
 SWI_beacon_of_peace_desc:0 "Switzerland has been through a series of tough trials and society-shattering crises, but has stood tall through all of them. Even as nations around us fight and squabble over their totalitarian empires, we stand tall in the middle of Europe as a burning beacon of peace and prosperity in the middle of the storm."
 SWI_unity_through_conquest_desc:0 "It is not by hiding in our homes and bracing for the coming tides that we shall weather the storm. It is by taking what is and has always been rightfully ours. The people must be united behind a common cause, and this cause is to take what our enemies have stolen from us."
 SWI_integrate_militias_desc:0 "The true heroes of the Savoyard Crisis are the brave men of the anti-syndicalist militias. Their support helped us strengthen our nation, but it is now time to integrate the political militias into our armed forces, so they can fight for our great nation once again."
 SWI_refugee_question_desc:0 "Switzerland has had a liberal immigration policy since the late 19th century. However it has become apparent that many of these migrants and refugees are to blame for many of our problems. While others have shown too much cowardice to stand up to international emigration, we must act to change our immigration policy."
 SWI_peoples_army_desc:0 "With the government overthrown, and the people put in control, it is now time to establish a new fighting force for Switzerland. We no longer need the figureheads of the past, the people shall lead our new army!"
 SWI_old_generals_desc:0 "While the vast majority of the 'Old Guard' has fled to Germany, some loyal officers still remain. However, letting them lead our armies may alienate those who fought for the revolution."
 SWI_new_officers_desc:0 "Our French allies have generously provided their support in training new officers for our military. With their support, we can rebuild the strong leadership our army has always depended on."
 SWI_swiss_liberators_desc:0 "Our people fought valiantly for the revolution, and it is now time to turn that fighting spirit towards our borders. The imperialist threat is greater than ever, and we will have to fight to defend our freedom."

Fearful of potential revolutionary influence by the Commune of France, the central government in Bern reacted swiftly by sending in the Federal Army to break the strike. In the ensuing violence 13 were killed and over 100 injured in Geneva. This has left a bitter divide between the Romandie and Bern which over the subsequent years has failed to heal."
