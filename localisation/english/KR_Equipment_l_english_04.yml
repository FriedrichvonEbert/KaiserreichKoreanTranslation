 RJM_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Mauser Model 1908 was an exceptionally long rifle based on the Mauser 1898 and chambered in 7x57mm Mauser. It was originally produced for Brazil by the German company DWM, but Brazil has subsequently begun to produce staggering quantities of the rifle domestically, and it became a staple in many state armies as time went it became almost synonym with the Interstate War in the cultural mindset of the nation. The Veracruz state's army used the same gear as the other states that formed Brazil, and alongside the southern states it was the premier fighting force of the region."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1:0 "1935년형 마우저 소총"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "마우저 M35"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Mauser Rifle Model 1935 is a unique Mauser Rifle which utilizes a 7x57mm cartridge produced domestically by Brazil and abroad in close conjunction with the Mauser company, as part of the extensive collaboration between the Brazilian and German governments. Said collaboration started in the 1910s, as a clique officers then derided as 'the Young Turks' by the press began lobbying extensively for closer cooperation with the global hegemon. Everything from helmets to artillery pieces started to be fashioned after the german model, and as such a modernisation of the older Mausers became a priority. This firearm became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Submetralhadora Bergmann Modelo 1938"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Bergmann M38"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "During the late years of the Pessoa presidency, Brazil purchased a relatively small number of Bergmann MP28 submachine guns, but they never saw much use outside of national guard regiments in Rio itself; The M38 is a simplified and easily manufactured derivative of the MP28 created in response to growing tensions in South America, and was intended to be the standard issue firearm for the entire Brazilian military and was produced in large quantities in foundries across the country and as such became almost synonymous with the Brazilian military during the Weltkrieg period."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Mosquetão Semi-Automático Rossi Modelo 1944"
 RJM_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Second Weltkrieg raged in Europe, Brazilian leadership found that their weapons were simply outmatched as the arms race between the great powers, and rather than try to catch up, it simply started producing an outright copy of the newest german semi automatic rifle designs such as the G41. The first models were made in the Rossi foundry in Rio Grande do Sul, wherein the model takes its name from. While more advanced than other weapons in use by the Paulista army, its low reliability made it unpopular with soldiers, who often preferred older models or even captured gear."
 RJM_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Rossi M44"
 RJM_support_weapons:0 "Metralhadora M.08/15 & Morteiro de 7,58-cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg saw the introduction of some of the deadliest weapons known to man, such as the fearsome M.G. Modell 08/15. In the close confines of trench warfare, the once archaic mortar was brought back to relevance. Many of these older piece of equipment were among the hardware directly sold or leased to Brazil over the course of the military mission from Germany in that nation."
 RJM_support_weapons_1:0 "Metralhadora M34 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_1_desc:0 "The Machine Gun Model 34 (MG34) was a recoil operated air-cooled machine gun. Chambered in the powerful 7.92x57-mm Mauser rifle cartridge, the machine gun's high rate of fire (900 RPM) and efficient mobility made it arguably the most advanced machine gun in the world at the time; and was eagerly shown to Brazil as a proof of the martial superiority of the Kaiserreich. The perhaps unexpected consequence of that was the fact that the design was copied with little regard for patents by the Rio government after Black Monday. The Mortar Model 34 is an infantry mortar that employs 8-cm shells. It has been noted for its high accuracy and rate of fire."
 RJM_support_weapons2:0 "Metralhadora M39 & Morteiro 'Torneira' de 20cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_2_desc:0 "The Machine Gun Model 39 (M.G. 39) was an improvement over the M.G. 34. This belt fed machine gun features a high rate of fire and is suited for all purposes. The 20-cm leichter Mortar Model 40 is a spigot mortar designed for striking obstalces and strong points. Brazilian copies were noted for having inferior quality materials in their fabrication, presumably to lower costs."
 RJM_support_weapons3:0 "Metralhadora Imbel M1 & Morteiro de 8cm"
 RJM_support_weapons_3_desc:0 "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however."
 RJM_infantry_at:0 "Metralhadora Anti-Tanque Imbel .50"
 RJM_infantry_at_desc:0 "The first models of heavy machine guns produced by Brazil, for Brazil, the Imbel models were noted for very high rate of fire, but also relatively low reliability and durability due to several corners cut during production. When it was working properly, it was one of the most fearsome weapons in the country's arsenal, however. Heavier variants were assigned to Anti Tank duties in the lack of proper weapons for the task in the armed forces."
 RJM_infantry_at2:0 "Lança Rojão M44"
 RJM_infantry_at2_desc:0 "The Model 44 Rocket Launcher, like many Brazilian weapons of its time, is a rather uninspired copy of european equipment used in the Second Weltkrieg, later produced and used by Brazil itself. Based mostly on the German 'Panzerschreck', the weapon shares most specifications with it, including its 8,8-centimetre rockets and the massive smoke trail left by firing."
 RJM_artillery_equipment_1:0 "Obuseiro Rheinmetall de 10,5 cm"
 RJM_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "After a series of military missions from and to Germany, Brazil's government started to import foreign artillery from that nation. These were Rheinmetall models were relatively modern for their time, but the nation had a very limited capacity for mass production of these at home. These guns were a significant upgrade from previous models used by Germany especially when it comes to hitting moving targets."
 RJM_artillery_equipment_2:0 "Obuseiro Modelo 41 de 11,5cm"
 RJM_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Obuseiro Modelo 41 was little more than a copy of the specifications of the Modell 36 field howitzer from the German army, but with some tweaks to lower production costs, at the expense of some reliability. Even so, the gun was extensively used by artillery in Brazil across the Weltkrieg period, and was the first piece of artillery mass produced domestically itself rather than being mostly imported."
 RJM_artillery_equipment_3:0 "Obuseiro Modelo 43 de 17cm"
 RJM_artillery_equipment_3_desc:0 "Still following the trend of copying specifications from German pieces of equipment, the 1943 update of the M41 had a slight increase in firepower, and some refinements with the intent of making it more reliable. However, production was limited during wartime, and the upgraded field gun was a rare sight over the early 1940s. In later years, however, it and models with minimal variations were used by the Carioca army until the 1960s."

 RJM_anti_air_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M2 de 2cm"
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_1_desc:0 "Anti Air weaponry was a defensive priority for Brazil, as the war between states had shown the vulnerabilities of the federal capital against aircraft despite extensive coastal and land based defences. Developed in conjunction and with support of Germany, the M1 and M2 were admittedly little more than copies of FlaK models from the early 1930s, but that was sufficient to deal with the relatively slow aircraft deployed in South America at the time."
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M5 de 3,7cm"
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_2_desc:0 "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything from the main axle to the size of the cannon itself. The M5 is closely related to its German cousin, the 3,7cm Fla.K 37, but is made of lower quality materials to meet the production needs of Brazil."
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antiaéreo M7 de 8,8cm"
 RJM_anti_air_equipment_3_desc:0 "As aircraft rapidly developed, several updates and changes to the standard issue M2 were made over the years, but later models of anti aircraft weaponry entirely different specifications regarding almost everything, and the M7 is almost entirely a departure from the original design all but in role. The M7 was the first piece of anti aircraft equipment designed domestically, but even so it retained so many similarities to similar guns in use by Germany and its allies in the Weltkrieg many experts claim it wasn't a different gun at all, but rather a domestically produced variant. The cumbersome gun saw little use in Brazilian service before the war was over."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_1:0 "Canhão Antitanque 'Alemão' de 3,7 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Initially an outright import from Germany, the gun was straight up called 'Alemão' by the troops in the barracks due to its strength and obvious foreign origin, as its makers made sure to stamp imperial eagle effigies in seemingly every model. While similar models in europe were designed to be drawn by motorised forces, Brazil used an outdated design more suited to the many horses it had available, and the lack of appropriate road infrastructure in an eventual frontline against Argentina. Said nation was the main motivator behind Brazil's move to start fabricating the piece domestically in small numbers after 1936, as the instability in that region, and having an unpredictable regime in possession of dozens of tanks, unnerved general staff in Rio."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_2:0 "Canhão Antitanque M2 de 7,5 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Developed entirely with German models as a basis, Anti Tank Artillery Model 2, or the AT2, was developed primarily against the types of heavier armour being used by european powers as the Second Weltkrieg raged. With Germany itself less than willing to cooperate with production this time, an illegally obtained piece was the basis for production domestically, which started much too late for widespread usage within the armed forces. The few models were usually distributed to divisions expected to face the burnt of enemy assaults."
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Canhão Antitanque M6 de 12,8 cm"
 RJM_anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Weltkrieg came to a close, the armour in enemy Tanks became almost overbearing to infantry and older models of artillery alike, and Brazil's solution was yet again to mimic european designs in a cheap fashion. This domestic version of the Pa.K 43 has all of the problems of the original guns, but with lower reliability and was made with cheaper materials. Steel shortages were the main reason for the staggeringly low number of units produced during the war."

 RJM_rocket_artillery_equipment_1_desc:0 "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Following the specifications of the original models, rockets of 32cm were used in these weapons, and a lack of said rockets is exactly why they were seldom used."

 RJM_rocket_artillery_equipment_2_desc:0 "Rocket artillery was rarely utilised by the Brazilian military during the war period, and the few pieces manufactured were direct copies of what little German equipment of the type Brazilian officers got their hands on. Changes to the size of the rockets required for usage made later models more common, but still far from standard issue and few pieces of the LF de 21cm were used in the field when compared to even the M43."

 SAF_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The venerable Lee-Enfield (SMLE) rifle that served the Empire throughout the Great War continues to be the standard arm of the Dominions following the Empire's collapse. Quantities of the SMLE rifle can be found in arsenal throughout the many Dominions. With rifle production seriously disrupted with the loss of the arms factories of England, the Dominions have turned to the old reliable three-oh-three as their standard weapon of choice until suitable replacements are created or purchased."
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "SMLE Mk V"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the fall of the Home Isles, the need to rearm what remained of the Empire became paramount. British engineers from the RSAF (Royal Small Arms Factory) began taking refuge in Ontario to work on an existing Lee-Enfield. The classic short magazine rifle's updated model displays a new and improved aperture system on the side instead of the middle, which features improved sighting radius, sighting accuracy, and sighting speed. However, due to the foraging and machining operations required to construct the rifle, the production of this new SMLE design is relatively expensive."

 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Owen Machine Carbine"
 SAF_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the prospect of war coming, the Army has requested a submachine gun to be developed for close quarters and urban warfare, especially with the destructiveness that characterises the civil war in America. The Canadian Army officially adopted a weapon designed by young Australian private Evelyn Owen. The "Owen" machine carbine features an impressive rate of fire and a cheap cost to manufacture while also being sturdy in rough conditions - making it ideal for urban combat. Compared with other submachine guns during testing, the Owen has shown itself time and time again to be the only one to withstand mud, sand, and harsh environments. With favourable testing concluded, large quantities of the Owen were dispatched to the Dominions in preparation for the coming war."

 SAF_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Crown Corporation Small Arms Ltd in Long Branch responded to requests from the Canadian government for a self-loading rifle. The self-loading rifle is chambered in 8mm Mauser cartridges and features a tilting bolt action. While the gun suffers from reliability issues and excessive recoil, the rifle comes with a shoulder pad to compensate for the recoil. In addition, the rifle's light weight makes it ideal for mobility and urban combat. Many copies were sent to arm the Dominions of the Empire in preparation for the eventual homecoming."

A chance discovery by scientists in the ISAC, the scope is shaped in the form of a canteen but contains a monocular infrared scope along with a battery. Assigned to only the most elite of the elite, the scope allows the unprecedented advantage of having vision in the dark."
 SAF_infantry_weapons2:0 "BSA Thompson M1926"
 SAF_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "The Canadian Army has formally adopted the iconic American submachine gun associated with crime and vice. The M1928A1 is the service variant of the classic M1921 Thompson Machine gun, and although production is expensive, the gun is well-liked among the troops in the field who praise its efficiency and reliability. While most variants rely on smaller 'box' magazines, some other variants feature large and bulky fifty-round drum magazines."
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2:0 "Lanchester Submachine Gun"
 SAF_improved_infantry_weapons_2_desc:0 "With the outbreak of all out war in the United States and the looming clouds of war in Europe, the Canadian Army desperately needs arms for the homecoming. With little time to prepare and research, the Canadian Army has commissioned the 'Lanchester' submachine gun, a near perfect copy of the German MP-28."
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2:0 "Canadian Machine Carbine Mk 1"
 SAF_advanced_infantry_weapons2_desc:0 "In further cooperation with the Small Arms Ltd at Long Branch, the Canadian military has officially adopted a new compliment and perhaps successor to the Owen. The Machine Carbine Mk 1 features a selective fire trigger with an innovative horizontal magazine to withstand dirt, dust, and sand. Pressure on the top of the trigger would fire the weapon in fully automatic, while pressure on the bottom would fire semi-automatic. While the new machine carbine features a lower rate of fire than the Owen, its reliability and ability to deal selective fire make it quite the potential successor. Many quantities found their way into the arsenal of the Dominions."

 SAF_support_weapons4:0 "비커스 M Mk III & ML 4.2인치 박격포"
 SAF_support_weapons4_desc:0 "The third variant of the esteemed Vickers machine gun was designed for anti-aircraft usage and features a slightly increased rate of fire from its predecessors.

Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

Unfortunately, due to Shanxi's narrow roads and mountainous terrain, and the technical blockade imposed by the Qing government on Shanxi, it was difficult for Yan Xishan to buy trucks directly from the Japanese. Therefore, in March 1932, he ordered the engineer Jiang Shouting to go to Tianjin to negotiate with the representatives from the American Federal Motor Truck Company. The Americans eventually agreed to transfer the 1.5 ton truck technology to Shanxi, and Jiang Shouting used this as a basis to create the reliable and durable Type Shanxi by the end of the same year."

The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs.

It borrowed heavily from the Canadian Vickers Mark E as well as interwar German designs, and sported a 20mm cannon besigned by the Italian Breda company. The vehicle received mixed feedback from soldiers in the field for its inadequate main armament and moderately failure-prone transmission."

A development of the earlier P-34, the P-I Vasyl addressed its predecessor's shortcomings, sporting an extended chassis and numerous revisions to nearly every component. The vehicle also sported a new German 20mm cannon, which, while of the same calibre as the older Breda gun, proved to be much more effective in training and combat alike."

Trials for an entirely new rifle were finally held in 1932, but would largely fail to bare fruit, with new designs unable to match the old Enfield or receiving unfavourable troop evaluations. In light of this showing, Enfield replacement efforts were ultimately tabled.\n\nIn 1935, however, a joint effort between The Revolutionary Small Arms factory in Enfield and Birmingham Small Arms was presented to the government. The new rifle was a development on the old Lee Enfield with a shorter barrel, side mounted sling, aperture sights, and a simplified bolt system."

The 12,8-cm Pa.K. 44 has a good anti-tank performance over long to extreme-long ranges - 1,800–2,700 metres and beyond - while also doubling as an effective field gun when firing high-explosive shells. But since it was not possible to install a 12,8-cm barrel on the carriage of a conventional anti-tank gun, a special carriage for the gun was designed.

Development continued, focusing on replacement of the existing cumbersome dual-axle mount with a lighter single-axle one, resulting in a 3,7-cm Fla.K. 36 with the practical rate of fire raised to 120 rounds per minute.

 WHR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Germany's eastern allies all had large stocks of Russian Mosin rifles, but they all adopted the 8mm Mauser cartridge to match German standards. Wanting to make cost-effective use of existing stocks until more Mauser rifles were available, Polish arsenals worked to convert Mosin rifles into carbines chambering the new official cartridge. The wz. 91/98/25 pattern would quickly be adopted by other Oststaaten to modernise their existing stocks."

 WHR_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg showed first-hand that full-length rifles were unwieldy in trench warfare with little benefit. Germany's famed assault troops were given the shorter Kar. 98AZ whenever possible, and soon after the war, it was decided to standardise on a carbine-length rifle to replace the G.98. The Kar. 98b, based on the AZ model, differed little from its direct predecessor, but more significantly from the longer G. 98, with improved sights and a turned-down bolt. More importantly, it used more parts from the long rifle to increase parts interchangeability and lower manufacturing costs. Many models were ordered by Belarusian government."

Unable to secure the German Army's standard MP-40, the Oststaaten often have to make due with what is commercially available through private firms. The MP-35, designed by Emil Bergmann and notable for its horizontal magazine on the right side, is a popular choice thanks to its relative ruggedness and affordability, along with Bergmann's willingness to license the design."

The design is very simple and easy to produce, mechanically an enlarged pistol made from extensive use of stamped sheetmetal, using the same intermediate cartridge and 30-round magazines. This semi-automatic rifle, while failing to impress the German Army, caught the interest of Oststaaten, especially Belarus, looking for a cheap alternative to the M.Kb. 42, as the Germans were unwilling to share them. Waffenfabrik Suhl is happy to produce and license the design for local production, significantly raising the firepower of the otherwise-light infantry of Germany's eastern allies."

Under ideal conditions, the R.Pz.B. 54 can penetrate heavy tanks’ armour with its 8,8-centimetre rockets, already used by the Raketenwerfer 43 rocket launchers. As a drawback, the R.Pz.B. 54 produces a lot of smoke upon firing. Many shipped over from Germany given Belarus' lack of anti tank weapons."

Chambered in 7x57mm, the Model 1902 is a highly modified Spanish Model 1893 Mauser integrating several parts and design elements from the later Mauser Model 1898. The Model 1902, which was purchased in large quantities from the German company DWM, is nearly identical to the domestically produced Model 1910."

While collectively inferior to newer rifles despite improvements, and often poorly maintained, the weapon is known to be rugged and reliable if unwieldy.\n\nThis variety is mainly produced at the Kunming Arsenal in Yunnan, though equipment shortages and personal preference often see it used alongside non-standard weapons such as the Dadao."
