 POLITICS_JAMES_HERTZOG_DESC:0 "James Barry Munnik Hertzog first rose to prominence as a Boer guerrilla leader in the second Anglo-Boer war; defiant to the last, he resisted the British long after the war had been definitively lost. Even in defeat, however, Hertzog continued to champion the Afrikaner people. He rose to leadership of the Afrikaner dominated 'National Party', and in 1924, became South Africa's first Nationalist prime minister in coalition with Labour. With the collapse of the United Kingdom the following year, Hertzog was confronted with the fact that he did not have the parliamentary majority to take South Africa out of the Empire, but managed to assume stewardship of the High Commissioner Territories. Hertzog, now as State President of the new South African Republic, has been a proponent of segregation between South Africa's various racial groups, and has encouraged the disenfranchisement and resettlement of South Africa's already oppressed black population."
 POLITICS_JAN_SMUTS_DESC:0 "Jan Christiaan Smuts, though an Afrikaner veteran of the Second Boer-War, had, by the onset of the Weltkrieg, become a staunch proponent of South African autonomy within the British Empire. During the Weltkrieg, Smuts led South Africa's armies against the Germans in Namibia and clashed with the famous Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck in East Africa. In defeat, Smuts continued for South Africa's future; while he was temporarily swept out of power in 1924 by the National Party, who wanted to break with Britain permanently, he was back in charge in 1929. He has been fighting for South Africa's alliance with the Entente for his entire career, and it does not appear he is about to give up."
 POLITICS_KING_EDWARD_SAF_DESC:0 "Edward of Windsor, with the passing of his father, 'King-Emperor', George V, was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
 POLITICS_NICOLAAS_HAVENGA_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Christiaan Havenga, once a loyal supporter of the James Hertzog and the National Party, and perhaps an even more radical Afrikaner nationalist, left the party over disagreements with its economic policies. He founded the 'Afrikaner Party' in opposition to what was, in his view, the regressive economic platform of the National Party. As president, Havenga seeks to deregulate foreign trade and promote the exploitation of South Africa's vast gold deposits."
 POLITICS_DANIEL_MALAN_DESC:0 "Daniel François Malan, former editor of the National Party's newspaper, Die Burger, has outmanoeuvred rival James Hertzog to secure dominance of South Africa's nationalist faction. Malan is, even by Afrikaner Nationalist standards, a hard-line proponent of racial segregation and the suppression of South Africa's black population. As State President, Malan strives to transform South Africa into a nation completely by and for the Afrikaner people, and by nearly any means necessary."
 POLITICS_EARL_CLARENDON_DESC:0 "George Herbert Hyde Villiers, the Right Honourable Earl of Clarendon, previously member of the British Government in Exile in Canada, was appointed Governor-General of South Africa in 1931, taking care of His Majesty's duties in South Africa for him: appointing the cabinet and dissolving parliament if need be. Notably, the earl is also the chief scout of South Africa. Despite the fact that his political wit induces respect, some voice concerns over the fact that South Africa's Governor-General is not a South African..."
 POLITICS_PAT_DUNCAN_DESC:0 "Sir Patrick Duncan was born in Scotland in 1870, in a time quite different from now, when Britain still ruled the world. Having emigrated to South Africa during the Boer War, after which he practised as an attorney and then joined politics first as a member of the pro-British Unionist Party and then after the merger the South African Party, Duncan is the first South African citizen to be appointed as Governor-General of the Union. A milestone."
 POLITICS_NJ_DE_WET_DESC:0 "Nicolaas Jacobus de Wet was never supposed to be acting Governor-General of South Africa: a judge by profession, he was Chief Justice of the nation when unexpectedly the existing Governor-General, sir Patrick Duncan, passed away. It was ruled that De Wet would do as an acting Officer Administering the Government of South Africa, and as such, De Wet is now both the first Afrikaner and first South African born in South Africa who takes care of His Majesty's duties as Head of State."
 POLITICS_ERNEST_JANSEN_DESC:0 "Pushed through on the insistence of the National Party, who were determined to get a 'neutral' Governor-General, of course coming from their own ranks, E.G. Jansen. Jansen, an Afrikaner from Natal, is as such the first Afrikaner and first South African born right here in South Africa who administers His Majesty's duties as South Africa's Head of State."
 POLITICS_JOHANNES_VAN_RENSBURG_DESC:0 "From secretary of former Justice Minister Tielman Roos, to dictator of South Africa. Few will have foreseen how events turned out. Van Rensburg has always been the leader of the most extreme wing of the National Party, speaking of the Afrikaner nation, appealing to the emotion and the religiosity of his audience while not making a secret of his disdain for the democratic system, the British and the supposed threat that the native South African poses to the Afrikaner 'Volk'. And now that he rules South Africa, it is no longer just rhetoric."

 SAF_repeal_industrial_conciliation_act:0 "산업조정법 폐지"
 SAF_repeal_industrial_conciliation_act_desc:0 "The Industrial Conciliation Act was a direct reaction to the Rand Rebellion in 1922 and gave white trade unions privileges that are slowing economic recovery. The Act must be repealed, and the unions must be brought to heel if we are to get the nation’s economy back on track. This will obviously be extremely unpopular with white workers."

 SAF_invest_in_witwatersrand_industry:0 "위트위터즈랜드의 부흥"
 SAF_invest_in_witwatersrand_industry_desc:0 "The mineral wealth in the Witwatersrand has been a commercial safety net during the economic crisis.

 SAF_establish_work_programs:0 "취업 프로그램 수립"

 SAF_bail_out_farmers_desc:0 "The ongoing crisis is a time of suffering for all people of South Africa, but the heaviest burden is without a doubt being carried by our farmers.

 SAF_large_scale_roadworks:0 "대규모 국도건설사업"

 SAF_establish_nuweveld:0 "누벨트 지역 설립"
 SAF_establish_nuweveld_desc:0 "Turning the newly annexed territories over to white settlers will encourage the establishment of new settlements throughout the Nuweveld and the cultural integration of the new regions.

 SAF_stellaland_affairs_act:0 "스텔랄랜드 정책"

 SAF_empower_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "Granting autonomy to the local rulers of the High Commissioner Territories will ensure the Paramount Chiefs of their respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland) shall be loyal to the central government."
 SAF_develop_basutoland_swaziland:0 "바수톨란드 및 스와질란드 개발"

 SAF_develop_bechuanaland_desc:0 "The sparsely populated region of Bechuanaland is without hyperbolics the least developed region in all of Africa, with any kind of construction remaining limited to a few wooden huts in most places. A series of well-placed investments will soften the contrast with South Africa just over the border."
 SAF_root_out_slavery:0 "노예제 발본색원"
 SAF_root_out_slavery_desc:0 "Slavery has long proven difficult to root out of the High Commissioner Territories, but the recent investment gives us leverage with the paramount chiefs to resolve the persisting issues, by making investments dependent on their action on slavery."

 SAF_question_of_native_autonomy_desc:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basutoland and the Swazi in Swaziland). But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - is it limited to within the borders of the HCT or does it encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa?"
 SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils:0 "자문위원회 강화"
 SAF_strengthen_advisory_councils_desc:0 "By strengthening the influence of the advisory councils on policy, we can assure that the interests of the Paramount Chief are at least somewhat balanced with both the European and native interests. It will also lay the groundwork for eventual reform into a bona fide democratic framework in the future."
 SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories:0 "지역재판제도 형성"
 SAF_chief_justice_of_the_high_commissioner_territories_desc:0 "At current the status of the law in the High Commissioner Territories is rather vague, members of the tribes are usually tried according to their own tribal traditions while Europeans are tried as if they were in South African territory, with certain exceptions. It is time we formalise a system with trained justices specifically to ensure fair trials for everyone in the territories."
 SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system:0 "수수료 개혁"
 SAF_reform_the_commissioner_system_desc:0 "We have made our fair investments in the High Commissioner Territories, but at current we still merely have a temporary mandate from the royal government.

 SAF_reorganise_the_national_party:0 "국민당 재조직"
 SAF_reorganise_the_national_party_desc:0 "Dr. Malan, the pathetic constitutionalist barrister, is allowing our Afrikaner destiny to be held back with this insistence to adhere to the South African constitution, binding us to worthless parliamentary procedures and endangering our nation's hold on power in South Africa in the process. If only a decisive and unrelenting figure could just do away with parliamentarianism and the liberals that thrive in it..."
 SAF_implement_apartheid:0 "아파르트헤이트 시행"

The Volksraad is behind us and set to carry our government's programme through."
 SAF_independent_perspective:0 "독립적인 균형"
 SAF_independent_perspective_desc:0 "We are a free and independent country now, not beholden to the will of Britain to sacrifice Afrikaner men to reverse their own failures at home, or to bully our German brethren, who have never done us wrong. Yet, as an independent South Africa pursuing South African interests, we are not against allies."
 SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs:0 "유럽문제 회피"
 SAF_retreat_from_european_affairs_desc:0 "General Smuts dragged us into the Weltkrieg, sending Afrikaners to die in the cold mud of a land alien to their own to further the imperial interest of an island that was not their own either. Now that South Africa is a free and independent country, we will cease to involve ourselves in the petty squabbles of the European powers."
 SAF_native_representation_act:0 "원주민 대표법"
 SAF_native_representation_act_desc:0 "A long-term Nationalist goal has been to remove native South Africans from the voting rolls and to allow them to vote for three separate white members of the Volksraad instead of pooling their property-qualified vote into South Africa's general electorate. The time to implement this plan is now!"
 SAF_gerrymander_districts:0 "지역 선거구 변경"
 SAF_gerrymander_districts_desc:0 "Troublingly, we are having trouble in getting a majority of the electorate to support us, and we mainly owe our hold over the government to the fact that rural constituencies are overrepresented compared to urban constituencies. Perhaps if we slightly redraw the borders, we can ensure this situation remains locked down in our favour."
 SAF_flags_amendment_act:0 "국기 게양식"
 SAF_flags_amendment_act_desc:0 "It is the result of compromise that South Africa, proud nation as it is, needs to fly the Union Jack, a symbol of oppression by Britain, next to its national flag in an official capacity. This act will ensure that our national flag will no longer see competition from the British national flag."
 SAF_expel_rensburg_pirow:0 "요하네스 반 렌스버그 추방"
 SAF_expel_rensburg_pirow_desc:0 "The power-hungry and paramilitary former administrator of the Orange Free State, Johannes van Rensburg, has been plotting to unconstitutionally seize the apparatus of state for himself for years now. It is time we distance ourselves from this shady figure by revoking his party membership."
 SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act:0 "유색인종 투표권"
 SAF_coloured_enfranchisement_act_desc:0 "Of all racial groups in South Africa, the mixed race 'Coloured' group is definitely the one seen as the closest to an equal by the South Africa's white European population. The first step towards gradually turning South Africa in a truly comprehensive democracy would be to abolish the property qualifications of this community in the Cape and Rhodesia, while extending franchise to them in the other provinces."
 SAF_native_trust_and_land_act:0 "원주민 재산 및 토지법"
 SAF_native_trust_and_land_act_desc:0 "The Native Trust and Land Act increases the designated 8% of South African land which has been reserved for South Africa's native population to approximately 13% of South Africa's territory. This measure will mean that land currently owned by whites will have to be bought by the government, a process that can take years, if not decades."
 SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act:0 "아시아인 토지소유법"
 SAF_asiatic_land_tenure_act_desc:0 "Conservatives within our party, especially those based in Natal, consider that Indian merchants are posing a threat to the white community by outcompeting their stores, both among whites and natives. They would like to ensure that white South Africans can secure their position by limiting the land which can be owned by Indians to certain designated areas."
 SAF_natives_consolidation_act:0 "도시 원주민 지역 통합"
 SAF_natives_consolidation_act_desc:0 "For a long time, we have been using pass laws to prevent native South Africans from encroaching on our urban areas, which are inhabited by white South Africans. The following act has been proposed by the conservatives to refine the pass laws and ensure that the privileged position of the urban whites can be maintained."
 SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme:0 "발하트 관개계획"
 SAF_vaalhart_irrigation_scheme_desc:0 "The Orange Free State, Northern Cape and Transvaal regions of South Africa are quite dry and therefore less suitable for agriculture. By building an extensive irrigation system out of the Vaal river we can ensure that our farms receive enough water for a good output of agricultural produce."
 SAF_expand_krugerpark:0 "크루거 국립공원 확장"
 SAF_expand_krugerpark_desc:0 "The Krugerpark is a wildlife reserve with its roots in the Sabi Game Reserve of the South African Republic (commonly known as the (boer republic of) Transvaal). In recent years it has attracted a modest amount of tourism from both the British and German spheres of influence who seem enthusiastic about the wildlife rail tours through the national park."
 SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine:0 "영국령 아프리카 수복"
 SAF_enact_smuts_doctrine_desc:0 "In the darkest hour of the empire, the revolution of 1925, the vile Germans illegally occupied most of British Africa, only leaving alone South Africa, the High Commissioner Territories, Gambia and Sierra Leone. Generals Pierre van Ryneveld and Jan Smuts have put together a plan to bring back at least the relatively easily accessible colonies of Northern Rhodesia and East Africa in the imperial fold."
 SAF_fire_broeders:0 "브로더본드 공무원 해고"
 SAF_fire_broeders_desc:0 "The Afrikaner Broederbond, a secret society of Afrikaners, posing as a cultural organisation encompassing many prominent South African politicians, soldiers and civil servants, has sought to push Afrikaner issues and rule South Africa from behind the curtains since its foundation. It is time we curtail the influence of these secretive men by requiring all of our civil servants to distance from them."
 SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act:0 "반체제 인사법"
 SAF_asiatic_enfranchisement_act_desc:0 "The Asiatic racial group of South Africa, comprised of Cape Malays who have been here since Dutch rule and Indian indentured workers introduced mainly in Natal, but also in the Transvaal and Cape province, form only a small fraction of the South African population, but most of them are currently denied the right to vote under similar conditions as the native majority. It is time to abolish these restrictions."
 SAF_found_sabc:0 "SABC 설립"
 SAF_found_sabc_desc:0 "Radio broadcasters have been active in South Africa since 1923, but South Africa has so far lacked a national radio network. As such, voices have risen in Pretoria to officially establish a 'South African Broadcasting Corporation', or, in Afrikaans, 'Suid-Afrikaanse Uitsaaikorporasie', which will broadcast two radio services: one in English, and one in Afrikaans."
 SAF_fund_stellenbosch:0 "스텔렌보쉬 대학 기금"
 SAF_fund_stellenbosch_desc:0 "The 'Universiteit Stellenbosch' or the 'Stellenbosch University' is, together with the University of Cape Town, the oldest extant university in sub-Saharan Africa. The university, which is certainly the most high profile of the nation, almost exclusively teaches in Afrikaans, and serves as somewhat of an intellectual hub for the National Party. Investing in them will increase our research capability."
 SAF_fund_cape_town_uni:0 "위트워터스랜드 대학 기금"
 SAF_fund_cape_town_uni_desc:0 "While not quite as classic as the Cape Town and Stellenbosch Universities, the University of Witwatersrand, founded by J.H. Hofmeyr, is certainly innovative. The university is multi-racial and as such (and through its founder), closely associated with the South African Party."
 SAF_join_isac:0 "수학학회 설립"
 SAF_join_isac_desc:0 "The South African Mathematical Society is a group of South African intellectuals, who, contrary to the name of the society, deal not only in mathematics but also physics and other such endeavours."
 SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion:0 "농업확장 집중"
 SAF_focus_on_agricultural_expansion_desc:0 "Our history is rooted in the exploits of the farmers who came to South Africa. It would be foolish to throw our cash into the pockets of the already rich British capitalists, who are ever hungry for workers to exploit, those workers being the Africans when the Afrikaners become too expensive. Agriculture is the strength of our nation and the root of our culture."
 SAF_subsidized_farming:0 "농업보조금 지원"
 SAF_subsidized_farming_desc:0 "One way to support our hard-working farmers is to hand out subsidies, allowing them to perhaps expand their lands a bit, take better precautions against wildlife aiming to attack their livestock, and investing in new machinery."
 SAF_support_cape_wineries:0 "케이프 양조장 지원"
 SAF_support_cape_wineries_desc:0 "The Mediterranean climate of the Cape is perfect for the cultivation of wine grapes, and as such, South African wine is world-renowned. We should make use of this export boom, and support our wineries in their endeavours."
 SAF_encourage_sharecropping:0 "소작법 장려"
 SAF_encourage_sharecropping_desc:0 "Sharecropping holds that a landowner allows a tenant to farm on his land in return for a part of the produce. Many Afrikaner farmers are unable to work all of their stretched land of our outstretched nation. It would be economically responsible to encourage them to allow sharecroppers to work this excess land."
 SAF_agricultural_innovation:0 "농업 혁신"
 SAF_agricultural_innovation_desc:0 "South Africa is a western nation, but also a nation of agriculture. It is only natural that we have been developing a significant edge on agricultural technology compared to other countries, and we can leverage this innovativeness into other fields of Research and Development."
 SAF_help_small_farming_communities:0 "소규모 농업공동체 지원"
 SAF_help_small_farming_communities_desc:0 "When crisis strikes, small farming communities who are unable to offset their goods are often the first victims. It is our responsibility as a government to protect these vulnerable farmers, and we could do that by subsidising their endeavours."
 SAF_industrial_farming_equipment:0 "공업용 농기구"

The Smuts-Roos government that came into power in 1929 kept these arrangements in place, and as such, the woes of Black Monday did not skip South Africa.\n\nThe crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market have gone out of business or laid off white workers in favour of cheaper native labour."

When the National Party rose and republican sentiments along with it, in combination with a unionist decline, they eventually agreed to merge into the South African Party. This SAP wing has persisted during the last 15 years.\n\nToday a group of unionist-inclined MPs, accompanied by several business leaders have come to appeal to prime minister Smuts to repeal the Industrial Conciliation Act passed by the Pact Government in 1925. The act affords several significant protections to the white worker which according to the business leaders cannot be sustained with the present crisis again pushing South African companies into the corner just after the effects of the Great Depression has worn off."

Prime Minister Smuts now needs to swiftly make a decision on how to proceed, because government action is necessary to alleviate the suffering caused by Black Monday.\n\nThe first option for the prime minister is to open coalition talks with the SAP's classical rivals, the National Party. There are profound differences between these two parties but if such talks would succeed the coalition would have an overwhelming majority in the Volksraad.\n\nSecondly, a deal could be reached with the National Council faction of the split Labour party led by Walter Madeley. They would likely be inclined to support the common-man oriented approach we had in mind and finding common ground with them would likely be much easier than with National.\n\nThen, we can decide to continue as a minority government as if nothing happened and seek out support on a per-motion basis. The unionists are likely deterred from bringing us down through a motion of no confidence as they have no party structure to defend their seats anymore. We could then likely negotiate with Labour on some bills and our lost Unionists on others, but this will leave the government without a stable majority at this crucial time.\n\nThen, finally, we can request that the governor-general dissolves the Volksraad and calls early elections, but of course this carries the risk of a victory by the National Party and would mean there would be no government able to counteract Black Monday for the coming weeks."

It appears that general Hertzog is willing to help out the SAP and even abstain from pursuing further nationalist goals until this Volksraad's term is up in 1938 'for the good of the country and Afrikanerdom' on two conditions: the first is that he, James Hertzog, will come to be prime minister of this coalition government. A somewhat arrogant stance to take as the leader of the smaller parliamentary party, but one that is when it comes to it most likely largely symbolic. His second demand is that we open up discussion about a controversial topic: to ease the suffering of Black Monday among the white Afrikaner farmers that form his support base he wants to set up the so-called 'Nuweveld Project' which would open up the Bechuanaland protectorate which South Africa garrisons on behalf of the British exile government for the settlement of white farmers.

Since then Madeley has been disputing the position of leader of the party with Creswell.\n\nAfter about a week of negotiation it appears they would join happily a coalition government with the SAP on the simple conditions that N.C. Labour receives two cabinet positions and affirmation that we will indeed be taking a common man-oriented approach to Black Monday.

Since the response to Black Monday was obviously not on the table in 1933 and makes for an entirely new situation, the governor-general swiftly followed the advice of the prime minister and dissolved the Volksraad.\n\nA rough campaigning season is expected in the coming six weeks as the effects of Black Monday will befall more and more South Africans. Jan Smuts will likely be campaigning on his credentials in alleviating the effects of the Great Depression, while James Hertzog will likely once again start a scaremonger among South African whites about the prospects of increasing native influence on politics and paint Smuts as a puppet of the mining magnates of the Rand who has allowed this to happen."

According to this act, the small black elite that can vote under Cape Qualified Franchise will be removed from the common voter roll and moved to a separate voter roll, voting for a Native Representation Council made up of white representatives.

His liberal lieutenant Hofmeyr, who has resigned his minister post in protest, as well as Natal conservatives such as colonel Stallard disagree with this, the former because it is an apparently unrightful restriction, and the latter because the prospect of increased native lands is too liberal for their taste."

The Asiatic Land Tenure act makes it impossible for 'Asiatics' - that is to say Natal and Transvaal Indians as well as Cape Malays - to own land outside specially designated areas.\n\nAs a gesture to liberals within the party, the act also grants Indians in Natal and Transvaal the right to elect whites to parliament on a separate roll and Natal Indians to represent themselves in the Natal Provincial Council.

Their faces seem to reveal little about their choice.\n\nIf this revolutionary piece of legislation passes and the vote is subsequently granted to the 'Coloured' population, this draft will undoubtedly become the most influential law in South African history next to the South Africa Act itself and we can be sure that the era of Afrikaner Nationalism in South African politics will almost certainly be closed. But if we have misjudged the situation and the conservatives in the [getSAPorUnited] defect causing the bill to strand, the ensuing split in our party and Nationalist 'Swart Gevaar' tactics will likely be fatal and South Africa will be taken down a dark path.\n\nFor better or for worse, the bill has been submitted.

After that prime minister Smuts received the floor. He admitted that his gamble had failed but he was adamant that 'years from now, people will look back on this moment, and think, what could have been!'. He finished his speech by declaring that he would not be waiting out a motion of no confidence by the Nationalists and the new National Conservatives and that he would ask the Governor-General to dissolve parliament this same evening to let the people decide on the issue.

Malan's constituency of Piketberg, but these grumblings will not matter. With the full support of our own party we have the needed majority in the Volksraad and they can do nothing to stop the bill from entering into force. In a speech that will likely become legendary, Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, who drafted the bill, thanked the Volksraad for their support and expressed hope that this bill will from here on out swiftly pass parliament, and eventually serve as the stepping stone towards a truly inclusive power-sharing arrangement with representation for South Africa's other racial groups as well.

The State President appoints the cabinet - now to be called the president's council - and can be removed by parliament for misconduct or incapacity following investigation by a joint committee.

The white settler population was not consulted in this decision, despite having clearly rejected the prospect of union in the elections for the advisory council in 1919. Since the integration, the Southern Rhodesians had been continuously electing secessionist majorities in their provincial council, but unwilling to leave the British Empire as a whole, they were deterred from actually following through in their rhetoric of leaving the union.\n\nNow that South Africa has abandoned the empire, the provincial authorities in Salisbury have swiftly affirmed their allegiance to the king-emperor and declared their independence from the illegitimate republic."

Secondly, there are the dominionists, who voted in favour of the secession and claim they would henceforth only ever accept reintegration under circumstances of an authoritarian government ensuring British South African supremacy of the Afrikaners. What's left is the SAP councillors who voted against secession.\n\nThe Dominionist Party and the UFP swiftly formed the independence coalition and declared the secession of Natal from the Union with the majority, following in the footsteps of Southern Rhodesia.

Both started out in one single Afrikaner South African Party, but the ideological differences between the two sides soon came to light and caused a split in the South African Party, with the former remaining in the original party and the latter forming their own 'National Party' in opposition to the former. Since then, Afrikanerdom seemed irreversibly split along ideological lines.\n\nThis remained so until the formation of the National-SAP coalition last year. This cooperation has been quite fruitful and both sides have to accept the prospect that their two-party dominance is increasingly challenged by other parties and independents dissatisfied with the status-quo, especially after the economic woes during the last two decades.

However, some question how long this fusion will actually hold, given the fact that the ideological differences in terms of race relations and South Africa's connection to the Empire between the former South African Party and the former National Party have been pushed to the background rather than disappeared.\n\nA certain segment of the National electorate wants nothing to do with it in any case: Nationalists in the Cape province, headed by the former editor of the 'Die Burger' newspaper, Dr. Daniel François Malan, have rejected fusion and announced their own continuation of the National Party, the so-called 'Gesuiwerde Nasionale Party' or 'Purified National Party'.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, English-speaking reactionaries within the South African Party lead by colonel C.F. Stallard also rejected fusion, citing their distrust of prime minister J.B.M. Hertzog and the Afrikaner Nationalist faction he carries into the newfound United Party."

Hertzog from the leadership of the National Party is a severe upset. Under the newfound leadership of the more radical dr.

Ever since, Madeley has been disputing Labour leadership with Creswell.\n\nAs a by-result of the much larger merger between the SAP and the National Party, this split has been healed as well: after prolonged alignment with the National Party in the Volksraad, Labour MPs from the Creswell wing have elected to join the newfound United Party as well, thus relinquishing their claim to being the Labour Party.\n\nIn this capacity, the National Council wing of the Labour Party remains now as the sole faction in the Labour Party, and thus the leadership of the party remains no longer in doubt.

They are planning to organise a re-enactment of the Great Trek with authentic ox-wagons who will move from town to town, starting in Cape Town in August next year, to eventually arrive in Pretoria at a designated location at Dingaan's Day, where the foundation of a grand Voortrekker monument is to be laid.

The first ox-wagons have already departed under the watchful eye of a large crowd, estimated to be made up of over one hundred thousand people - astounding given that Cape Town is considered to be a British city. The chairman of the Great Trek Centenary Committee, National politician H.J. Klopper, owns the first two wagons of the parade, and invited all of Afrikanerdom to partake in the festivities. The ox-wagon parade will follow the so-called 'Pad van Suid-Afrika' to Pretoria, while a smaller contingent will split off at Vegkop and instead journey to the location where the battle of Blood River took place in Natal. Over the next few months, the ox-wagons of the re-enactment will be passing through numerous small towns and larger cities where Afrikaners in classic Voortrekker clothing, while the 'dominee', the town priest, will be welcoming them with extensive festivities."

In all these settlements, the festivities have been a resounding success, bringing out a wave of intense Afrikaner patriotism. However, the city of Port Elizabeth is primarily inhabited by English-speakers who are quite hostile to this celebration of Afrikaner culture, and for this reason, as well as the unfriendly attitude towards Afrikaners espoused by its mayor, Klopper has decided against seeking the confrontation by holding a parade through the city, with the parade instead directly moving on towards the small town of Willowmore and after that to towards Graaff-Reinet and the site of the Slagter's Nek rebellion in 1816 which is regarded as one of the reasons behind the original Great Trek."

At Slagter's Nek the festivities were especially massive and in every town where the parade arrives the song 'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika' is sung by the crowd. Despite its limited size as a farm near Steynsburg, Bulhoek is significant because it is the birthplace of Paul Kruger, the famous president of the South African Republic (Transvaal) who eventually died in exile during the Second Boer War. Here too large amounts of people welcomed the parade, if not as many as in Slagter's Nek. Tomorrow the parade will pass into Steynsburg proper and within a few days the ox-wagons are expected to cross into the Orange Free State, leaving the Cape Province behind."

Once the parade will arrive in Pretoria, our seat of government, the re-enactment will have visited them all.\n\nIn previous cities the parade visited, many street names were renamed in honour of Afrikaner heroes, but English-speaking town council of Bloemfontein has refused to follow suit. In response, Klopper has refused to use the new oxen provided by the city and made a statement by pulling the wagons through the city by hand. At the same time, torches were revealed by young participants of the Trek, which had apparently been kept alight since the parade left Cape Town.\n\nThe rest of the month will be dedicated to the trek to the site of the Battle of Vegkop, near the town of Heilbron."

They will travel south from here into the province of Natal, to be present at the site of the battle of Blood River, which will be exactly a century ago coming Dingane's Day, visiting cities like Ladysmith, Pietermaritzburg and Durban on the way.

Despite the fact that Johannesburg too, is a British city, the crowd is large, although it will likely be dwarfed by the receiving crowd in Pretoria three days from now.\n\nAs the parade leaves the city, it is reinforced with additional ox-wagons of local Afrikaners, some of whom are flying the 'Vierkleur': the flag of the defeated South African Republic."

The festivities are still officially apolitical, but the crowd was singing 'Die Stem' and calling for a republic.\n\nWhen the Ossewa's finally arrive, a giant bonfire was lit with the torches that have been kept alight from Cape Town and three Afrikaner women, descendants of the Voortrekker leaders, placed the first cornerstone of the monument. Then, the wagons are - without their oxen - carried upon the hill. Once firmly put in place, heroic scenes of the original Great Trek were re-enacted; the descendant of a British settler who gave one of the first Voortrekkers a bible was shouted down for reciting the English greeting of his ancestor in this play. In the evening, the festivities were closed off with the traditional South African Braai.\n\nAt the same time, the smaller delegation that split off at Vegkop arrived at Blood River, where they were welcomed by Dr. D.F.

Both pointed at the draft of the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, which would pass parliament tomorrow under Malan's guidance.

While neither has much love for syndicalism, Hertzog believes that no South Africans should die in what is strictly a European conflict, and that unreservedly joining the side of the British would hurt Afrikaner-British relations here in South Africa. Instead he propagates armed neutrality, remaining out of the war unless our interests are directly threatened.\n\nSmuts on the other hand, wants South Africa to partake in the homecoming directly, arguing that South Africa has this moral obligation towards the British Empire, as its dominion and to make up for the protection the country is afforded within its framework.

 saf.105.d:0 "Territorial separation was hardly a new institution in South Africa. There were, for example, the 'reserves' created under the British government in the nineteenth century. Under apartheid, the percentage of land reserved was increased from 8 to 13 percent to be used for black homelands, still a relatively small amount compared with the total population, and generally in economically unproductive areas of the country. These homelands or 'Bantustans' divided South Africa into a number of separate states, each of which is supposed to develop into a separate nation-state for the different ethnic groups. The practical effect of this legislation was to remove the citizenship of natives living within South Africa and reduce their status to that of migrant labour. The Promotion of Bantu Self-government Act abolished the remaining parliamentary representation for black people under the Representation of Natives Act, now represented by their own 'national' authorities."
 saf.105.a:0 "Interesting."
 saf.106.t:0 "Race in South Africa"
 saf.106.d:0 "South Africa's population is perhaps the most diverse in all of Africa, but racism and segregation are institutionalised and omnipresent.\n\nThe white European population forms the top of South Africa's racial hierarchy; they hold socio-economic power in the nation and enforce a degree of segregation throughout South Africa. The group is divided between the Afrikaners, the descendants of Dutch colonists who arrived in the Cape during Dutch rule, who hold political power owing to being the majority of the almost exclusively white electorate, and the British South Africans, English-speaking descendants of colonists who arrived in the 19th century, who hold most economic power, although this is shifting somewhat to the Afrikaner advantage in recent years.\n\nOf the non-white population, the so-called 'Coloured' community enjoys the most respect. This group is made up of people of mixed heritage and most of them speak Afrikaans, the same language as white Afrikaners. They make up the majority of population in the western Cape Province, and make up the largest part of the non-white property-based voters in that same province as well as in Southern Rhodesia.\n\nThen there is the Asiatic group: South Africans of Asian descent. The majority in this group are former indentured workers from British India or their descendants, who live primarily in Natal and to a smaller extent in Transvaal. In the Cape one can also find the Cape Malays, who were brought here from Maritime Southeast Asia by the Dutch in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nThe least respected are the original (native) black Africans. Most of them belong to one of several Bantu peoples, the Xhosa, the Zulu, the Sotho or one of several smaller tribal groups. Despite making up the majority of the South African population by far, they have very little political power, even in the provinces where non-whites can theoretically vote, where very few of them fulfil the needed property requirements. With an entrenched white electorate, hopes for reform are dim."

 saf.107.t:0 "Clements Kadalie Returns from Exile!"
 saf.107.d:0 "Originally from Nyasaland, Clements Kadalie was South Africa's first black national trade union organiser and the founder of the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union in 1919, which has grown to be the largest native rights organisation, with active as far north as Zambesia. With its influence, the union also played a crucial role in the success of the South African revolution.\n\nIn 1924, the South African government had deported Kadalie, who left for London just in time to play a role in the revolution there. Ever since, Kadalie has acted as the representative of the South African syndicalist movement in London and Paris. Now that the bourgeois government of South Africa has been torn down, the influential politician has returned to South Africa to mark his presence in post-revolutionary politics. When his ship arrived in Cape Town he received a hero's welcome by a crowd waiting for him."

 saf.108.d:0 "The Johannesburg convention has opened. South Africa's old government is no more and delegates from across the country of all ethnicities have gathered in Johannesburg to establish a constitution to base a newly crafted government on. Drafts are based on the systems of government of Britain and France, but it seems clear that there will be factionalism. On the one hand, there is David Ivon Jones and his ISL, who, while openly calling for an eventual power-sharing arrangement, argue that whites will first need to guide the socialist state until the popular majority is sufficiently educated and politically aware to be able to properly participate in communal politics. On the other hand is the ICU, which have elected to be led by the newly arrived Clements Kadalie. They want to immediately implement a system of ethnic federalism, giving a degree of autonomy to each ethnic group under a unified multiracial state.\n\nAs a compromise between the whites who fear swamping by the larger amount of natives, the decisions will be made by a half-split group of representatives of both organisations."
 saf.108.a:0 "Let the debates begin!"
 saf.109.t:0 "The Legislative Branch"
 saf.109.d:0 "The first clash between the ISL and ICU materialises on the topic of the legislative branch. While both sides agree that the new legislative institution should be bicameral and that the 'lower house' should be a confederation of trade unions, which they have agreed will go by the name of the 'South African Confederation of Trade Unions' (SACTU), it is the upper house that is cause for consternation.\n\nThe ISL seeks to establish the so-called 'Advisory Commission', an organ elected by white South Africans which serves to check the legislation approved by the SACTU, which can block legislation or amend it with the approval of the government. The ICU on the other hand wants the upper house to be an Ethnic Representation Council, with each ethnicity receiving two delegates, who can with a majority send legislation back to the SACTU, who would then be obliged to amend or repeal it before sending it back to the ERC."
 saf.109.a:0 "A white check is necessary."
 saf.109.b:0 "Each ethnicity needs representation."
 saf.110.t:0 "The Judicial Branch"
 saf.110.d:0 "Another clash has started over the judicial branch: the ISL wants a single and colour-blind judicial system for all South Africans, regardless of the circumstances of the crime, but no right to object to who judges you based on the colour of their skin. In effect, because almost exclusively whites have been educated in the law, this means the old judicial system will likely be mostly preserved, and as the system creates no pressure to educate new non-white lawyers, justice will be carried out almost exclusively by whites for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis reality has been noticed by the ICU, who instead want it constitutionally entrenched that each racial group in the federation will have the right to be judged by their own ethnicity if they so desire in a case against the government, and a judge not held to the ethnicity of either side in a civil case."
 saf.110.a:0 "We don't have the manpower at present to accommodate for that right!"
 saf.110.b:0 "This right is the only way to definitively prevent racial prejudice in the justice system!"
 saf.111.t:0 "The Executive Branch"
 saf.111.d:0 "The final conflict is with regards to the executive branch.\n\nThe ISL wants the government to derive its legitimacy from the upper house, and to atypically make it possible for that house to recall government officials only. Under their plan, the SACTU will only have the ability to control the government through failing to approve its legislation.\n\nOf course, the ICU disagrees, and wants the point of gravity to be with the SACTU/lower house, which more properly represents the will of the people according to them as it is elected indirectly but equally by every worker in our nation."
 saf.111.a:0 "The Upper House is more important!"

 saf.112.t:0 "The ISL Government Is Inaugurated."
 saf.112.d:0 "The Johannesburg Convention has closed and a constitution has been approved. Elections have been held on the grounds of the decisions made and it was clear that the ISL managed to concentrate a large amount of power on themselves. It is of little surprise therefore, that the David Ivon Jones, leader of the provisional government, has been elected as South Africa's first chairman. He then recommended a cabinet which was swiftly also approved. Under Jones' guidance, socialism in South Africa will likely venture into a bright new future. Many white South Africans are also thoroughly relieved by the monoracial makeup of the new government."
 saf.112.a:0 "Workers of the World unite!"
 saf.113.t:0 "The ICU Government Is Inaugurated."
 saf.113.d:0 "The Johannesburg Convention has closed and a constitution has been approved. Elections have been held on the grounds of the decisions made and it was clear that the ICU managed to break the power monopoly the ISL was intent on designating to themselves. As such, after years of exile in Britain, Clements Kadalie has been elected as the first non-provisional chairman of the new South Africa, and the first non-white head of state of the nation. Seeking to prevent racial struggles from embracing the country, he has recommended a cabinet with members of each of South Africa's ethnicities, headed by the secretary of the executive, Solomon Sachs, a white South African and friend of Kadalie. Despite this, the new mostly non-white government takes some adjusting for the white population of South Africa, and unrest in areas where they form the majority is on the rise."
 saf.113.a:0 "A new South Africa dawns!"
 saf.114.t:0 "The ICU Fires Clements Kadalie"
 saf.114.d:0 "It has been reported that the executive committee of the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union has fired Clements Kadalie as the chairman of the union.\n\nWhile Kadalie was toasting with the leadership of the Union of Britain after being deported, the running of the ICU was taken over by people on the ground right here in South Africa, fighting suppression by South African authorities. This already created a perception that Kadalie hijacked the voice of the ICU without having partaken in the revolution, but as the founder of the organisation, Kadalie had the needed support to pull the members along.\n\nTo a dead end, it seems now, because Kadalie had been advocating working with the ISL and their white leaders, despite the opposition from the Africanist faction in the Union led by James La Guma. Now it appears the ISL government is only marginally interested in the ICU, and has given few if any worthwhile concessions.\n\nGiven it is Kadalie who led the union here, he is the one to take the fall. Following his dismissal, the executive committee appointed Jimmy La Guma the new chairman. It is expected that La Guma will pull the ICU into a more radical direction, for he was never afraid to share his opinion that the black population of South Africa is the true proletariat."

 saf.115.d:0 "The newly appointed chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union, the Africanist James 'Jimmy' La Guma, has denounced the ISL government. According to him, our new socialist government has little functional difference with the old regime, being a vehicle to securing the position of the whites over the backs of a black proletariat.\n\nApparently we pay lip service to the idea of majority rule to appeal to Paris while we suppress black participation in practice. It is the natural outcome as the white working class is economically dependent on the work of the black working class and therefore he declares that the ICU will have to continue its struggle and work towards a native republic."
 saf.115.a:0 "Tolerance for the intolerant!"
 saf.116.t:0 "An African Revolution"
 saf.116.d:0 "The government's decision to allow trade unions to deny new members on the basis of race has put the flame to the powderkeg, and compelled the ICU to act, with success: during the night, militias affiliated with the Industrial and Commercial Worker's Union have occupied strategic locations throughout South Africa. From Cape Town to Pretoria to Salisbury and Durban, militias control the streets. In Pretoria, David Ivon Jones and the rest of the cabinet have been arrested by these forces.\n\nIn the morning, South Africa was addressed by radio by La Guma, who declared himself the new Chairman of [SAF.GetNameDef]. The faux-socialist regime of the white ruling class has been overthrown, and the true, black, proletariat would finally rise to power after so many years of oppression.

These communities are now gripped with fear of being swamped, both by other racial groups and are leaving South Africa in large numbers to countries they consider to be more friendly to their kind, such as elsewhere in the British empire or in Europe.\n\nWhile fortunately, many others also choose to stay here, the unfortunate truth is that these emigrants take with them much valuable knowledge and expertise that thanks to the discriminatory segregationist education system is not beholden to the wider population. It is believed time will be needed to recover from this setback."

 saf.119.d:0 "Many in the European population had already been sceptical on the prospect of socialist governance, leading to a wave of white emigration while the South African government was still colour-blind. However, to many, La Guma's indigenist government, with aggressive rhetoric to the white diaspora, is considered by many the worst possible outcome, causing a second wave of emigration, possibly even more severe than the first one by a segment of white South Africans who had stayed, depriving South Africa yet again of valuable expertise and curtailing our economic output once again."

 saf.120.d:0 "With an eye to the coming elections, the National Party has decided to organise a national congress in Pretoria to determine party policy of the next few years. Members from across the nation have travelled to our government's seat.\n\nDuring the course of the congress, the leader of the National Party in the Cape Province, Dr. D.F. Malan, has been chastising the party’s nationwide leader, general James Hertzog, on many accounts, especially concerning the failure to abolish the monarchy during his term as prime minister from 1924 to 1929 and his subsequent failure to defeat Jan Smuts and his South African Party, for which the moderate and vague standpoints of Hertzog are to be blamed according to Malan. It comes as little surprise then that Malan subsequently challenged Hertzog for the party leadership of the party. The members were asked to speak out their preferences. Hertzog’s failure in the last 8 years to seize the office of prime minister back from general Smuts had sealed his fate: dr. Malan would lead the National Party in the next general election, on an aggressive republican and Afrikaner Nationalist platform, decrying that once given the mandate he will declare South Africa’s full independence as a republic now that the exiles are not in a position to act against such a measure."

As such, the day holds importance to Afrikaner nationalism as well, whose adherents view the victory that day as a sign from God that they were to shape a western country in South Africa's wilderness.\n\nThe day is generally celebrated with sports matches, especially cricket, theatre shows, church gatherings and other festivities. Unsurprisingly given the context, the nation's black African majority is less fond of the holiday, and usually pick this date to protest racial discrimination."

In the many constituencies outside of the Cape, where barring some exceptions the new 'Coloured' voters could not make a difference versus the existing white electorate, gains have been limited, in no small part due to the splits the National Party has been suffering, causing the more consolidated government candidates to win in some constituencies which were destined to go to the Nationalists otherwise. Some newspapers have already declared Afrikaner Nationalism a thing of the past, reduced to a large minor party which could at best secure a king-maker position.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, the Labour Party has been making gains.

The death of the Boer general of German heritage from the Orange Free State, former prime minister and founder of the National Party marks a turning point in South African history, calling in a final end to the rivalry between the politicians from Transvaal and Orange Free State which defined the South African political scene since the formation of the union.\n\nAs preparations for the funeral are underway, the National Party needs to decide who shall become their new party leader. It is widely known that Hertzog favoured his protégé within the more moderate faction within the National Party, Nicolaas Havenga. However, Dr. D.F. Malan has also thrown his hat in the ring for party leadership and enjoys much greater name recognition among the party membership."

 saf.148.d:0 "Disturbing news from the coal mining town of Ermelo in the Transvaal has arrived. A group of armed Zulu men has attacked the local bank and taken away into the Drakensberg mountains with what were supposed to be the wages of the miners. According to reports from eye-witnesses, the robbers claimed the continuation of the Ninevites, a historically feared gang, which has lost much of its prominence - at least outside of the prisons and as a unified entity - following their leader Nongoloza’s disavowal following encouragement of the authorities.\n\nIt is theorised that economic hardship as a result of Black Monday must have pushed these men who either were previously affiliated with the gang, or knew someone previously affiliated to it, to organise once again. Despite their best intentions, the police have been unable to track them down."

 saf.149.t:0 "The Regiment of the Stone Hits Nelspruit"
 saf.149.d:0 "The new iteration of the Regiment of the Stone gang has emerged from their apparent Drakensberg hideout once again, this time in Nelspruit, where they hit the local train station, a key stopover on the line between Johannesburg and the port of Lourenço Marques in Mozambique, and made off with valuables held for safekeeping there. Once again, police stood powerless to prevent an evidently well-planned escape into the bush to the south of the town.\n\nDisturbingly, it appears the gang has already grown in number since their heist in Ermelo, and similarly worryingly, the town of Barberton, where Nongoloza is incarcerated on a rape charge, is only some 20 miles away from Nelspruit. Police theorises that it is the gang’s intention to break him out. Others disagree and point out that this would be too obvious, and that the two successful heists, in combination with smaller robberies underway, have already netted the group a substantial amount of wealth. One more successful heist would likely procure the monetary means needed for the group to disappear forever, and in modern times and resources like auto-mobiles and aeroplanes, it seems implausible that a gang would remain at large for as long as the previous gangs have. Therefore they propose an attack on Barberton would be a large risk following their existing achievements, and they instead point at the town of Lydenburg as the next target. Some don’t agree with this proposal either, and expect the gang will aim to leave South Africa by entering Portuguese East Africa as soon as possible, as the route of movement from Ermelo to Nelspruit suggests. If we can correctly estimate their next move, we might be able to entrap them."

If the South African Police would not have been there to assist the prison wardens, they might well have succeeded, but instead they were entrapped. A shootout which could be clearly heard in Barberton itself ensued, until a large part of the gang was deceased and the remainder wisely decided to surrender. Law-abiding South African citizens need not fear these men anymore, nor was Nongoloza given the opportunity to escape, although there is little indication he conspired with the gang.\n\nThe gang members who surrendered have guided our officials to their hidden encampment some four miles from the prison, where we have recovered most of the stolen goods and money from the Ermelo and Nelspruit heists."

 saf.151.t:0 "The Barberton Breakout"
 saf.151.d:0 "While a South African Police detachment attempting to entrap the Regiment of the Stone was obtusely waiting for a robbery that would never come, the gang simply struck at the most obvious target: the Barberton prison.\n\nThe poor prison wardens, facing an overwhelming amount of criminals, were left little choice but to hand the elderly Nongoloza, as well as some other gang members incarcerated at the prison, over to the gang, who was reportedly reluctant at first but eventually did join the gang in their escape. Now with Nongoloza within their ranks, the gang has disappeared into the wilderness again, but on a positive note, the Lydenburg gold transport safely arrived in the vault of the Standard Bank of South Africa in Johannesburg."
 saf.151.a:0 "Jislaaik!"
 saf.152.t:0 "The Barberton Breakout"
 saf.152.d:0 "The attempt to entrap the Regiment of the Stone at the border was perhaps doomed from the beginning, for the border region is simply too large: the stretch of the border over which the gang might have made its escape was well over a 100 miles. Properly reinforcing the entire region to prevent a crossing would have been impossible.\n\nBut this does not matter either way, because it appears the Ninevites never intended to cross the border. Instead they stayed in the vicinity of Nelspruit and struck Barberton Prison, where the wardens were, under the pressure of the overwhelming force of the gang, left with little choice but to hand Nongoloza over, and some other people incarcerated there with affiliations to either the old gang or new gang members."

 saf.153.d:0 "After a couple of months of very little activity of note, the Regiment of the Stone has again struck: this time they have emptied out a jewellery in the town of Piet Retief, leaving with thousands of pounds worth of jewellery. Despite the police’s best attempts, and a subsequent large scale search through Swaziland, where we suspect the gang had been hiding between the events in Barberton and now, and where they probably retreated back to, we have been unable to either find them, nor did we find back any of the riches they have stolen, aside from some South African Pounds spent in Mbabane which can be traced back to the first bank heist in Ermelo."

 saf.154.d:0 "For months now, there has been no regiment activity anymore. Some believe a dispute has caused the gang to disperse, others believe they have simply crossed the border with Portuguese East Africa with their loot at some point and left South Africa forever. Whatever the case, it seems unlikely by now that the stolen goods will be recovered. Hopefully the victims were properly insured.\n\nThe failure to control the gang does not reflect well on the South African Police."

Not so in the upper echelons of Johannesburg society, where men in red garments still speak about their exploits on five continents with one another under the enjoyment of a gin-tonic supplied by a Zulu servant.\n\nFollowing two years of preparation, the Empire exhibition, celebrating the city of Johannesburg’s golden jubilee, has been opened with great festivities. The exhibitions both boast our achievements in the last half-century and include representatives from most of what remains of the empire: from Canada and the Caribbean to Australasia and its pacific extensions. While an atmosphere of nostalgia is unmistakable, the celebration takes away from the talks about liberation and politics holding grip on our country, and shows that the empire is still alive as ever!"

Now that this regime has fallen, their barbaric policies are naturally being rescinded. Unfortunately, this brings some unintended side-effects with it: rural South Africa is not very rich in opportunity, and thus, with the possibility of moving to cities like Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban suddenly no longer severely restricted, many thousands of South Africans are now leaving their ancestral lands to seek employment in the factories and mines. Unfortunately, the local governments do not actually have the resources to handle this unprecedented influx and most of these migrants are thus forced to settle in existing townships at a scale never seen before, overpopulating them and causing extremely squalid conditions and disease in these townships as a result."

Even when they subscribed to the tenets of socialism so short ago, they still rejected turning this historical abomination into a more equitable settlement.\n\nNo more: we shall take what was stolen from us and return it to the people.

Since then, the ANC had been working to create a united front with Indians and Coloureds, and sympathetic whites to achieve reform.\n\nUnder the leadership of Anton Lembede, several young ANC-aligned activists - Nelson Mandela, B. Masekela, Ashby Mda, Ida Mtwa, Lillian Ngoyi, James Njongweni, William Nkomo, Duma Nokwe, Walter Sisulu, Oliver Tambo and Dan Tloome - have gathered in opposition against this compromissory attitude, and formed the African National Congress Youth League in Johannesburg. The new youth league is known to make use of Africanist rhetoric, and released a ‘Program of Action’ against the white minority regime, involving the use of boycotts, strikes and defiance tactics.

Prior to [GetYear] non-whites have had to rely on religious institutions for their lower education, while whites have had access to state-funded and private schools of western standard.

As will be seen, the constitution is only intended for the Afrikaners; the English are to play a subordinate role.\n\nThis is the first article of the new constitution which has been ratified by Commander-General Van Rensburg today in Pretoria. The new basis of South African law, drafted by professor Lodewicus du Plessis of the Potchefstroom University, does away completely with the old 1909 South Africa Act-based constitution of D.F. Malan’s republic.\n\nThe new constitution heralds Afrikaans as the national language while demoting English to be merely ‘supplementary’, vests all powers into the office of ‘Volksleier’ - people’s leader - who is only responsible to God, not beholden to any votes in the advisory parliament, and who can implement and ratify laws on his personal signature. Citizenship will be beholden only to those the 'of whom it can be expected that they will act as builders up of the nation' and those are called ‘burgers’. It also gives the state the express permission to censor those ‘burgers’ and organisations that endanger public order or the good morale of the republic.\n\nWith this, the power of the newly ordained Volksleier Van Rensburg is legitimised and supreme."

During the Weltkrieg, they attempted, unsuccessfully, to remain neutral in the German-South African conflict, culminating in the battle of Sam Khubis where they successfully defended their community from German forces. When in 1919 South Africa was forced to turn South West Africa back over to the Germans, the Rehoboth community was split between those who would inevitably be seen as pro-South African collaborators and sympathisants (especially Sam Khubis veterans) who were forced into exile in South Africa, and those remaining in Rehoboth, with their historic autonomy revoked.\n\nNow that Bechuanaland has been opened to white settlement, their \"Kaptein\", or chief, Albert Mouton has petitioned the prime minister for the establishment of a \"Nuwe Roheboth\" in Bechuanaland, relatively close to their old settlement across the border, which would be expected to attract the scattered exiles.

Its ports fulfil a vital export role for our industrial base and most of it is commonly included in the concept of Greater Rhodesia. Possibly, the Germans might be plotting to take colony which would increase its leverage over us.\n\nHawks are urging us to act first by ordering our army to cross the Mozambican border, so as to ensure that Rhodesia’s interests are secured, and some of them are probably hoping we will annex the colony outright in the future. On the other hand, doves reject this course of action and point out that this would force Rhodesia to take international responsibility for the Mozambicans henceforth, and unnecessarily inflames tensions with the Germans and Portuguese."

After this speech, the march commenced to much fanfare. To most watchers, these fierce-looking soldiers from the Union of Britain gave them the sense of excitement they had expected.

The French soldiers were quick to surround the tank, keeping back the crowds as repairs were made. The tank was quickly fixed with the commander allowing several children to ride on the chassis as they drove to local barracks. This instantly won over the locals, who began to call the French "Camarades" and shout what few French words they knew.

This is will be the first opportunity for the newly enfranchised Coloured South Africans to show their power, as they make up the majority in this constituency which has been under Nationalist control since 1921. The National Party has nominated its candidate, as did the [getSAPorUnited]. We already know that in 1943 this constituency will be scrapped, but the outcome will likely clarify on a small scale what stands to happen in the general elections."

This would allow for the creation of more jobs within the urban areas of South Africa, and assist with the current unemployed crisis. Though not all have found this move popular, Hertzog's major voting base, the Rural Boers, being forced to hire lower paid black workers, and putting their more desired, though more paid, white labourers out of work."
