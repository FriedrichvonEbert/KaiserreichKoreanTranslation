 oma.1.t:0 "오만 소개"
 oma.1.d:0 "Oman's splendid isolation did not end with the Weltkrieg and the Sultan hoped it wouldn't end any time soon. However, the wheel of fate stops for no one, and their protectors in Britain and India fell into utter and complete disarray. With Ottoman forces moving into the Trucial States, and an ever more aggressive Ibn Saud in Nejd, it seemed war was coming fast to Oman, and the tale of the Ibadi Sultanate was to finally end.\n\nHowever, the much feared war never came. The warriors mobilised by the state never saw battle against the Ikhwan and the Saudis... Perhaps Ibn Saud has other, more obscure plans in his mind? Regardless of reason, Oman stood alone, and has not received aid from British India in a decade. This may very well become an extremely worrisome state of affairs as instability rapidly spreads throughout the region.\n\nBut to properly fight external threats, internal ones must be properly dealt with. More specifically the Imamate of Oman, and the tribes that have their allegiance to the Hinterlands Imam higher than to Muscat; not to mention the degraded and archaic state of the Monarchy. But if these challenges can be overcome, Oman's tale is not to end so soon."

 oma.14.t:0 "Ibn Saud marches on the al-Buraimi Oasis"
 oma.14.d:0 "Placed on the border between Muscat and the former Trucial States, ownership over the Oasis has been a contested affair for many generations between the Sultans of Muscat and the Emirs further North. With the conquest of the latter by Ibn Saud, he has also taken over these old claims and is using them for his own machinations.\n\nIt is no secret however that Ibn Saud is not planning to stop his advance after taking the Oasis and by claiming that we were once part of the great Wahhabist state, he will surely not stop until the city of Muscat is ablaze and the vile Ikhwan has slaughtered all that oppose him.\n\nThe threat posed by Ibn Saud however has ensured better relations between the Imam and the Sultan as despite their differences, they both strongly adhere to Omani particularism and will stop at nothing to defend their homeland from the invaders."
