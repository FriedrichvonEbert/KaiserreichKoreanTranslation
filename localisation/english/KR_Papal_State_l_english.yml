 POLITICS_PIUS_XII_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XII, formerly Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli, is a man of great spiritual fervour. He is renowned for his piety, but has a strong authoritarian streak that is matched only by his desire to protect the people."
 POLITICS_STEPHEN_X_DESC:0 "Pope Stephen X, formerly Cardinal Elia dalla Costa, is a gentle man renowned for his charitable nature and love of the poor. Most assume he will eventually turn the Papacy away from its direct rule of the nation, and already forces are gathering within the Papal State to determine who will undertake that role."
 POLITICS_JOHN_XXIII_DESC:0 "Pope John XXIII, formerly Cardinal Achille Liènart, is a controversial choice as Pope. He is a well-known socialist, considered by some to even be a radical, and it's possible he was chosen by the Papacy due to the possibility his socialist leanings will lead to a reconciliation with the north."
 POLITICS_JULIUS_IV_DESC:0 "Pope Julius IV, formerly Cardinal Alfredo Schuster, is a man renowned for his passion. He has been involved in the running of the Papal State for many years, and, as the former Archbishop of Milan, has declared syndicalism to be an evil he will battle until it is eradicated from the Earth."
 POLITICS_PIUS_XI_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XI, formerly Cardinal Achille Ratti, was elected to the Holy See in 1922, having spent most of the previous years as a papal representative in the newly re-established state of Poland, and was named a cardinal in 1921. Thus, he avoided most of the turmoil of the civil war and the danger that the Papacy underwent in its later stages. He was the first pope since the unification of Italy to give an ascension speech at Saint Peter's, as the practice has been abandoned during the 'Hostage Years' under the Savoyard monarchy. His papacy has been also marked by increasing tensions between factions in the Curia, and the troubled re-establishment of temporal authority."
 POLITICS_COLLEGE_CARDINALS_DESC:0 "While the conclave is in session, Carmelengo Eugenio Pacelli holds de facto administrative roles. however the Holy See is officially empty, and the Papal State thus lacks a Head of State formally. The conclave is usually a time consuming process that may set the State and the Church itself in a brand new path for decades to come."

 PAP_declare_independence_from_SIC_desc:0 "While we are grateful to the Sicilians for protecting the Holy See, it does not do to have the Papacy under another nation's control, even unofficially. The Pope shall issue a declaration of independence, and we shall see our own destiny."

 PAP_claim_donation_of_pepin_desc:0 "The lands of Central Italy rightfully belong under the purview of the Catholic Church, dating back more than a thousand years to the Donation of Pepin. We will not see them in enemy hands, so long as we have anything to say about it."

 PAP_fund_neosanfedisti_desc:0 "The oppression of good Catholics in [SRI.GetNameDef] affords us an opportunity to fund a resistance, one which will weaken the syndicalists as well as give us the ability to raise partisans in their territory once the inevitable war with the North begins."

 PAP_ask_permission_neosanfedisti_desc:0 "Since [SIC.GetNameDef] would be forced into a position to defend us, should our attempt to fund the Catholic resistance bring the ire of [SRI.GetNameDef] down upon us, it falls on us to first ask the Sicilians if they support our efforts."

 PAP_stephen_x_desc:0 "Elia dalla Costa is a man most favoured by the people due to his charitable nature. However, he is not a man overly interested in politics, and his election will most likely result in the Papacy giving way to the rule of the people."
 PAP_help_poor:0 "도움이 필요한 이들"
 PAP_help_poor_desc:0 "The poor of our country need to be fed, just as our Lord commands us to do. The new system of charity will make use of popular donations, allowing the government to invest its resources elsewhere."
 PAP_displaced_families:0 "실향민 가족 구호"
 PAP_displaced_families_desc:0 "The collapse of Italy following the Weltkrieg and rise of syndicalism in the north caused many refugees to flee south, and even today along the border some seek shelter from syndicalist tyranny. Despite our duty to help we have largely neglected these refugees and left them in squalid conditions, something which the new Pope is determined to rectify."
 PAP_call_people:0 "A Call to the People"
 PAP_call_people_desc:0 "The thing about the poor and the common people is that they exist in multitudes. Fed, clothed, and provided the fire of inspiration which only God can provide, they can be marshalled to support the will of the Pope with a fervour unmatched by any mercenary."
 PAP_john_xxiii:0 "교황 요한 23세"
 PAP_john_xxiii_desc:0 "A socialist at heart, Achille Lienart would do his utmost to prevent another Weltkrieg by decreasing the political tension. Electing him could even mean limited friendship with the syndicalists, no matter how unpopular such a move would be among devoted anti-syndicalists."

 PAP_trade_unions:0 "기독교 노동조합"
 PAP_trade_unions_desc:0 "Trade unions are the bedrock of the modern social state. In our country, they should be completely Catholic, inspired by the Christian trade unions of Germany and Flanders-Wallonia. Through the unions, we can also encourage the worker-priest missionary initiative, allowing the priesthood to take up work in factories and rediscover the working masses who have become disaffected with the Catholic Church."
 PAP_economic_incentives:0 "경제적 장려책"
 PAP_economic_incentives_desc:0 "With the unions empowered, we must mobilise the workers of the Papal State to expand our industry and make it the heart of our growing state. To begin this process we must assist our industry by creating artificial demand through public projects requiring industrially manufactured goods and materials."
 PAP_eccalesiastical_matters:0 "교회 문제에 집중"
 PAP_eccalesiastical_matters_desc:0 "As was to be expected the new Pope intends to restore democratic government to Rome, allowing him to focus on ecclesiastical matters. His legacy will be extending the rule of the Papal State to its people."
 PAP_relinquish_temporal:0 "속세의 권력 포기"
 PAP_relinquish_temporal_desc:0 "The last step in social reform is recognising that God's place is to guide, not to rule. True power belongs in the people, and a democratic state must be erected to look after their welfare."
 PAP_peoples_rule:0 "The People's Rule"
 PAP_peoples_rule_desc:0 "Some in the Curia and even among the ordinary priesthood remain opposed to the establishment of democracy in Rome, if we are to promote a stable system in the long-term we must seek to promote the new government and relinquishment of temporal power within the Church and clergy."
 PAP_pius_xii:0 "고황 비오 12세"

 PAP_fight_corruption:0 "부패 척결"
 PAP_fight_corruption_desc:0 "Pope Pius XII intends to issue a new encyclical, one aimed at corruption - both in the soul and within the government. It offers guidance to a nation struggling with finding its path."
 PAP_julius_iv:0 "교황 율리오 4세"
 PAP_julius_iv_desc:0 "Alfredo Schuster is a man described by many as leaning too far right ideologically. He warns against the evils of radical socialism, and declares he is willing to take up arms to defend Christendom by any means necessary."
 PAP_promote_order:0 "Promote Order"
 PAP_promote_order_desc:0 "The new Catholic way of governance will ensure every man of every occupation will be represented accordingly, leading to a much more stable government."
 PAP_call_faithful:0 "A Call to the Faithful"
 PAP_call_faithful_desc:0 "The heart of Christianity itself is threatened by the godless syndicalists. With the enemy so close to the Holy See the faithful of Rome and the Papal Zouaves must fight with all their strength to ensure that the Lateran Palace remains untouched by our vile foes."
 PAP_holy_war:0 "성전"
 PAP_holy_war_desc:0 "The time has come for the Papal State to take on its role as the defender of God and virtue, and for the people to rise up to its service in an Eleventh Crusade against syndicalism."
 PAP_temporal_power:0 "세속적 권력 강화"
 PAP_temporal_power_desc:0 "The increasing secularisation of society means a lessening of the pope´s influence. However, there are ways by which we can reinforce his influence inside his own borders."
 PAP_condemn_mobrule:0 "중우정치 규탄"
 PAP_condemn_mobrule_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a scourge of all things holy. It is unacceptable to let Catholics join syndicalist movements. The pope must publish an encyclical to make this clear."
 PAP_strengthen_border:0 "국경 강화"
 PAP_strengthen_border_desc:0 "If an invasion comes, it will be by the evil syndicalists to the north. We must strengthen our border, fortify it to withstand the onslaught."

 PAP_general_election:0 "Call for General Elections"
 PAP_general_election_desc:0 "Following the revival of the Roman Senate the next step to bringing democracy to Rome will be to call for a general election to elect a civilian government that will oversee the task of administrating and developing the revived Rome into a modern nation."
 PAP_civilian_government:0 "Organising a Civilian Government"
 PAP_civilian_government_desc:0 "With the transition from the temporal power of the Pope to democracy and civilian government complete we can now declare the end of the Papal State and the birth of the Kingdom of Rome, with the Pope reigning akin to a constitutional monarch."
 PAP_black_monday:0 "검은 월요일 대처"
 PAP_black_monday_desc:0 "The entire nation has fallen into despair and unemployment with the collapse of the economy. Finding our way out will be a long road, though we are better off than some."
 PAP_lazio_subsidies:0 "라치오 보조금"
 PAP_lazio_subsidies_desc:0 "The collapse of the Kingdom of Italy dealt a major blow to the economy of Lazio, and the industries that did survive have been dealt a harsh blow by the Black Monday crisis. If we are to maintain Lazio's industry and economy we must start with subsidies so that they may weather the crisis and expand in future."
 PAP_revive_industry:0 "공업 진흥"
 PAP_revive_industry_desc:0 "The industries hit hardest in Rome by the fall of Italy were those that depended on supplying the military, which was no longer needed after the war by the Papal State who saw themselves as protected by the Kingdom of Two Sicilies and saw no need for anything larger than an enlargened Palatine Guard. Now we must begin to revive our military industries so that we may field a modern army of our own."
 PAP_aid_farmers:0 "Aid Farmers"
 PAP_aid_farmers_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the farmers of the primarily agricultural Lazio hard due to a lack of sales from exports, and some farmers have even fallen into bankruptcy and forced to sell their farms. If we are to help both our people and economy we must begin to aid our farmers and save them from bankruptcy through subsidies and limiting production of agricultural products to create demand."
 PAP_agricultural_incentives:0 "농업 보조금"
 PAP_agricultural_incentives_desc:0 "One way to further improve our agriculture and recover from the Black Monday crisis would be to reduce taxes on agricultural equipment and raise protectionist tariffs in order to encourage domestic farming over foreign goods and provide another source of revenue for the government."
 PAP_economic_recovery:0 "검은 월요일 회복"
 PAP_economic_recovery_desc:0 "The burst of industrial and agricultural development in our country has clearly been enough to spur the Papal State's recovery from the financial nightmare. Let us all celebrate!"
 PAP_campaign_promises:0 "공약 이행"
 PAP_campaign_promises_desc:0 "We have promised much to the people of Rome during the former Papal government and the first elections. Now that we are in power we must begin to live up to our promises and build the Kingdom of Rome into a nation worthy of sharing the name of the greatest empire in history."
 PAP_infrastructure_investment:0 "로마 현대화"
 PAP_infrastructure_investment_desc:0 "Rome was last given a fresh start when rebuilding from the 1527 sack by the Charles V's armies. Since then, the population has boomed, but many of these new citizens find themselves living in ramshackle houses, as slums crowd ancient Roman buildings. We must engage in a program of urban renewal to make our great city both more beautiful and more efficient. The people in the slums may not see it that way, though."
 PAP_military_railways:0 "군용 철도"
 PAP_military_railways_desc:0 "A critical part of waging war that often gets overlooked is logistics. If we are to keep our armies well supplied in the coming war against the syndicalists up north we must ensure that our military railways are in top working order so that supplies and equipment may be delivered quickly to the front with few complications."
 PAP_education_reform:0 "교육개혁"
 PAP_education_reform_desc:0 "We have so far neglected the need for a modern and highly efficient education system and the necessity of keeping the scientists well supported. Our new progressive reform will improve our situation in this area greatly."
 PAP_university_grants:0 "교황령 내 대학 보조금"
 PAP_university_grants_desc:0 "We know of many bright minds in our universities, but unfortunately, they need more funding to continue their projects, which the Church is ready to provide. It is time to improve the qualities of our scientists."
 PAP_expand_ports:0 "항구 확장"
 PAP_expand_ports_desc:0 "While the Papal State invested much into rebuilding the Pontifical Navy for a new age, the ports themselves and especially the shipbuilding industry were often neglected. With enough development, the docks of Rome shall become an ideal centre of shipping in the Mediterranean."
 PAP_heavy_industry:0 "중공업 유치"
 PAP_heavy_industry_desc:0 "For Rome to be an effective military power as it once was we will need to build artillery, vehicles and armour to assist our troops in battle against the larger and stronger armies of our enemies, as well as steel for building modern military equipment. To do this we will need to adjust our laws and spending to attract and encourage heavy industrial production."
 PAP_airfield_expansion:0 "군 비행장 확장"
 PAP_airfield_expansion_desc:0 "Our air force leaders have long been demanding additional funds. Our air bases do indeed need expansion."
 PAP_roman_army:0 "로마군"
 PAP_roman_army_desc:0 "Our former government, confident in the unlikelihood of a war and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, did not invest much in an army leaving the defence of the nation to only a small Palatine Honour Guard. With war seemingly becoming an inevitability it is essential that our army is fit to inherit the legacy of Rome and isn't reliant on Sicilian protection."
 PAP_armed_citizenry:0 "무장시민"
 PAP_armed_citizenry_desc:0 "If Rome is to protect its independence from the northerners or the exiled Savoyards its citizens must be prepared to resist any invading armies. Inspired by our Swiss Guards we can begin to implement a Swiss-style militia system, requiring our citizens to own a personal rifle and ammunition and to engage in periodical combat and marksmanship training so that our people can fight effectively when the time comes."
 PAP_industry_captains:0 "대실업가"
 PAP_industry_captains_desc:0 "While the days of Rome being the world's greatest power are gone we must foster the Roman economy as much as possible. The greatest decider of economic strength in this era is industry, which the previous government under Pius XI viewed negatively and was reluctant to encourage. Now that Rome is under new governance we must undo these previous policies and ensure that Roman industry flourishes."
 PAP_men_of_rome:0 "Men of Rome"
 PAP_men_of_rome_desc:0 "Should our nation be invaded every man in Rome must be ready and determined to resist and drive out the invaders by any means necessary, using guerrilla warfare and their knowledge of the terrain to outwit and ambush the occupying forces."
 PAP_legionary_spirit:0 "군단 정신"
 PAP_legionary_spirit_desc:0 "Through the discipline, organisation, persistence and motivation of the Roman Legions Rome emerged from an Italian city-state to become the world's greatest power and forever left a glorious mark on history. In these precarious times, we must revive this legendary discipline and make the legions of Rome internationally renowned once again."
 PAP_army_reorganisation:0 "군 재편성"
 PAP_army_reorganisation_desc:0 "Ever since the re-establishment of the Papal State the defence of Rome was left purely up to the small Palatine Guard and the protection of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. With the new civilian government reforming the nation and army it is time to establish a professional army so that we may stand up for ourselves against the northerners."

 PAP_latin_perimeter_desc:0 "우리의 북쪽 국경은 노출되어있습니다. 국경선을 강화해야만 합니다."
 PAP_combined_arms:0 "제병협동"
 PAP_combined_arms_desc:0 "Now that we have begun to field a proper infantry army and fortified our borders for war with the North we should begin to fully modernise our army by researching motorised vehicles and tanks to assist our infantry in battle and encircle the enemy forces."
 PAP_navy:0 "교황의 해군"
 PAP_navy_desc:0 "Despite our state's small size we have rebuilt the Pontifical Navy following independence from the Italians. However, our current fleet, including the former Italian battleship Roma, is becoming old and outdated, and will only be able to stall the enemy for a while should war break out. If we want to rule the seas we will need to continue building and modernising our navy."
 PAP_in_being:0 "현존함대"
 PAP_in_being_desc:0 "The Pontifical Navy must gallantly face the enemy's naval forces head on and claim the Mediterranean as our sea, as our ancestors did long ago."
 PAP_trade_interdiction:0 "무역 차단"
 PAP_trade_interdiction_desc:0 "While we may have dominated the Mediterranean long ago our small state has no hopes of achieving such an ambition today. If our navy is to compete successfully against stronger opponents we must focus on hitting the enemy's trade."
 PAP_roman_fleet:0 "로마 함대"
 PAP_roman_fleet_desc:0 "Long ago, we exercised the absolute control over the Mediterranean. It would be shameful if our ambitions were not to once again rule the area by large and powerful ships."
 PAP_submarines:0 "잠수함에 중점"
 PAP_submarines_desc:0 "Submarines are an exceptionally powerful weapon. Relatively easy to build and deadly to even the biggest ships, they need to be focused on."
 PAP_screens:0 "순양함 중점"
 PAP_screens_desc:0 "Cruisers and Destroyers are useful in many ways and it is imperative to have a fleet to patrol our waters. They should be included in our navy."
 PAP_air_force:0 "The Pontifical Air Force"
 PAP_air_force_desc:0 "While we have built up a sizeable navy by the standards of a small nation such as ours, we have not yet invested in an air force, giving our enemies a critical advantage over us. We must quickly rectify this if Rome is not to be destroyed from above in the event of war with the Socialist Republic of Italy."
 PAP_defend_skies:0 "Defend the Skies of Rome"
 PAP_defend_skies_desc:0 "Without air superiority, we can never make use of aircraft. Improving our fighters should be our top priority."

 PAP_closeair_support:0 "CAS Focus"
 PAP_closeair_support_desc:0 "Our land forces need proper air support to fight effectively. Our new CAS designs will help us achieve this."
 PAP_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bomber Focus"
 PAP_naval_bombers_desc:0 "We can achieve a certain level of naval superiority without even using our ships. However, better bomber models will need to be developed."
 PAP_radar:0 "Radar Focus"
 PAP_radar_desc:0 "With the syndicalists having an industrial advantage over our small nation we must stay a step ahead if we are to defend ourselves in the air, the building of radars could help us achieve this advantage by allowing us to detect our enemy beforehand and react accordingly."
 PAP_anti_air:0 "Anti-Air Defences"
 PAP_anti_air_desc:0 "While we have begun to fortify our borders and have an effective navy to combat syndicalist invasions from the sea we have neglected our defences from the air. We cannot allow the precious works of art and history in Rome to be destroyed by syndicalist bombing raids."
 PAP_reformed_power:0 "Reformed Temporal Power"
 PAP_reformed_power_desc:0 "The Pope has established that his temporal power over the Papal State and its claimed territories offered to us by the Donation of Pepin and stolen by the Piedmontese in 1860 shall continue. To enforce this and quell dissent ultramontane groups have proposed that we establish the temporal power of the Pope as a dogma, divinely revealed by God himself."
 PAP_faithful_arms:0 "Call to Arms for the Faithful"
 PAP_faithful_arms_desc:0 "The Papacy has a history of using foreign soldiers to defend it, and with the Catholic nations of France and northern Italy under syndicalist rule there are many devout Catholics and war veterans with grudges against the Communards who will flock to our cause and help us bolster our forces for the coming fight."
 PAP_palatine_guard:0 "Expand the Palatine Guard"
 PAP_palatine_guard_desc:0 "The current Palatine Guard, while expanded since the years following the fall of Italy with the incorporation of the Swiss Guard, still remains far too small an army for our protection against the growing Syndicalist might. We must expand the Palatine Guard into reborn Zouaves if we are to be able to field a proper army against our enemies."
 PAP_zouave_officers:0 "Zouave Officers"
 PAP_zouave_officers_desc:0 "While we have received many Catholic volunteers willing to join our army, a majority are inexperienced exiles fleeing Syndicalist rule in the north of Italy and the French Commune. We will need to recruit some experienced Catholic officers to successfully train and lead our reformed Zouaves into battle."
 PAP_zouave_mobilisation:0 "Zouave Mobilisation"
 PAP_zouave_mobilisation_desc:0 "Now that war has broken out we must rally the Catholic world to our cause and encourage foreign volunteers to join the Zouaves and protect the Universal Church from Syndicalist desecration."
 PAP_financial_aid:0 "Financial Aid"
 PAP_financial_aid_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has severely affected our state and sent our national debt spiralling out of control, encouraging dangerous democratic and syndicalist sentiments and unrest among our people. If we are to maintain order and bring our economy back to normal we must seek financial aid from our longtime protector, the Kingdom of Two Sicilies."
 PAP_budget_rebalancing:0 "Budget Rebalancing"
 PAP_budget_rebalancing_desc:0 "With the effects of the crisis still affecting our state despite our attempts to get financial aid from the Sicilians we must enact austerity measures if we are to quickly recover from Black Monday, even if it is unpopular with our people in the short-term."
 PAP_temporal_debt:0 "Ending Temporal Debt"
 PAP_temporal_debt_desc:0 "Unfortunately our austerity measures while having a positive effect have not been yet completely eliminated our national debt or the economic repercussions of Black Monday. One radical idea to end the crisis would be to use Papal gold to repay those whom we are indebted to, which would be popular among the people but unpopular within the Church."
 PAP_military_aid:0 "Military Aid"

 papalstate.3.t:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno"
 papalstate.3.d:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part, he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\n\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope, therefore, demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporatism is just beginning."

 papalstate.39.a:0 "Let us pray they choose wisely."
 papalstate.40.t:0 "The State of the Papacy"
 papalstate.40.d:0 "Following the collapse of Italy after the Weltkrieg, Rome became in danger of capture by the republican rebels against the old Kingdom. The blurry battle lines of the civil war mostly spared Rome due to the protection of the southern royalist forces, which, together with local right wing militias, crushed uprisings in Rome. The Pope soon emerged from the Vatican to take back up the administration of his God-ordained domain, but the debilitated state had no armed forces loyal to it, and it had scarce chances at resisting any Syndicalist offensive. However, the white generals in the south would not stand by while the centre of Catholicism fell to syndicalism, and led a counter-offensive to secure Rome, bringing the Papal State under royalist, later Sicilian, protection, receiving support from foreign volunteers in Rome, the reborn Zouave corps.\n\nAfter the war ended, the Papal States joined the Italian Federation along with its protectors in Naples, but controlled only a small fraction of its nominal territory, and was and is in most respects a rump, puppet state of the Sicilians. Following the declaration of independence along with Sardinia and the Two Sicilies in 1926, it has been recognised as an independent state by the majority of nations in the world, though it is extremely limited in its diplomatic options.\n\nIn the sphere of Curia politics, the fading health of Pius is in everyone's minds, and it remains to be seen who will succeed him should he pass in the coming years."
