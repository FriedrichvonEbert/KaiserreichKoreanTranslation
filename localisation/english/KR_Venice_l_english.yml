 venice.1.t:0 "First Session of the Great Council"
 venice.1.d:0 "For the first time in over a hundred years, the Great Council of Venice convenes once more. Members from across the republic gather in Venice to discuss how the Venetian Republic should be structured. Already two camps have emerged between those that want Venice to be a modern republic and those that want the Republic of Old to be re-established."
 venice.1.a:0 "Let us begin"
 venice.2.t:0 "Election and term of the Doge"
 venice.2.d:0 "The first question to come up is the election of the Doge. In the old republic, the Doge was elected for life by the Great Council. 30 members were chosen by random lot, who would then be reduced to 9 by random lot. Those 9 would name 40 members who had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 40 were reduced by lot to 12, who named 25 members. Those 25 had to be approved by 9 of the 12. The 9 would name 45, and each member had to be approved by 7 of the 9. The 45 members were then reduced by lot to 11. These 11 named 45 who had to be approved by 9 of the 11. These 45 were finally reduced by lot to 25, and they would finally choose the Doge, who kept the position for life.\n\nNaturally, the old system is considered rather archaic. Those within the Great Council seeking to modernise the Republic instead propose that the Doge should be elected directly by the people and with a four-year term limit, subject to re-election."

 venice.18.d:0 "Unbelievably, we are losing ground to the Venetians. Either we give them what they want now, and hope they stop there, or we may end up facing a rather humiliating defeat at their hands, one where we lose everything."
 venice.18.a:0 "End this war now"
 venice.18.b:0 "No, this is too early to call yet"
 venice.19.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace"

 venice.19.a:0 "Let's end this"
 venice.19.b:0 "Why stop here? We will take everything!"
 venice.32.t:0 "Restarting the Marriage to the Sea"
 venice.32.d:0 "For centuries starting in 1000 CE there was the Festa de la Sensa and the Marriage of the Sea held on Ascension Day. However, since Napoleon destroyed the republic in 1798 the festival stopped being celebrated. However, today the Republic is reformed and today we can celebrate once again the Venetian Republic's Marriage to the Sea."
 venice.32.a:0 "We wed thee, sea, as a sign of true and everlasting domination."
 venice.33.t:0 "[GetYear] Sposalizio del Mare"
 venice.33.d:0 "Today we once again celebrate the marriage of the sea. Numerous decorated ships left the harbour of Venice baring dignitaries both from within the Republic and visiting dignitaries. After numerous speeches the Doge [Root.GetLeader] tosses a ring into the lagoon signifying the marriage of Venice to the Sea. Later in the night, fireworks exploded celebrating the national day of Venice throughout Venice including other cities besides just Venice proper."
 venice.33.a:0 "We wed thee, sea, as a sign of true and everlasting domination."
 venice.34.t:0 "Reviving Venetian Carnival"
 venice.34.d:0 "During the days of the Venetian Republic, Carnival was a popular festival that celebrated the end of Lent and before Ash Wednesday began. Even after the end of the Republic in 1798, the festival was always popular and private festivals would remain celebrated. However, now that the Republic is restored we can begin to celebrate Carnival once again."
 venice.34.a:0 "Long live Venice."
 venice.35.t:0 "Venetian Carnival"
 venice.35.d:0 "Today the cities of the Republic fill with people who come to celebrate the Venetian Carnival. The city of Venice and many cities within the Venetian republic are filled with people in colourful costumes and intricate masks with fireworks at the end of the day marking the end of Carnival."
 venice.35.a:0 "Long live Venice."
 venice.36.t:0 "Ponte della Libertà"
 venice.36.d:0 "Today marks the opening of the Ponte della Libertà or the Bridge of Liberty. The Ponte della Libertà connects the city of Venice to the Mainland.

The Sebastiano Venier Naval Military School also helps to ensure a love of the sea with numerous related activities from sailing to swimming. Many of the teachers and faculty are either members of the Venetian navy or once served in the Venetian Navy."
 venice.37.a:0 "A new generation of Venetian sailors."
 venice.50.t:0 "The [GetYear] [Root.GetAdjective] Elections"
 venice.50.d:0 "The months leading up to the elections for the new Doge and his party this year in [Root.GetNameDef] have been as divisive and charged as ever. With people flooding to the polls, the winner turns out to be..."

 venice.50.b:0 "... the Partito Repubblicano Veneto"
 venice.50.c:0 "... the Lega Cattolica"
 venice.50.e:0 "... the Partito Popolare Veneto"
 venice.51.t:0 "Electing the Doge"
 venice.51.d.revolt:0 "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: Giuseppe Volpi, hero of the revolt, and Giovanni Ponti. Volpi would perhaps be a shoo-in, thanks to his role in obtaining Venice's independence, but there are many conservatives who believe his ideas of reform are too liberal. Ponti is far more favoured for his place among the wealthy elite, and the fact he would see the role of the nobility expanded... whereas Volpi was not even in favour of returning to the ways of the Old Republic. Still, the vote will be close."
 venice.51.d.norevolt:0 "The byzantine process to select the new Doge-for-life has taken weeks, but now it is down to two candidates: the liberal, Giuseppe Volpi, and the conservative, Giovanni Ponti. Considering Volpi and his party were not even in favour of returning to the ways of the old republic, Ponti is the heavy favourite. Even so, Volpi's connections among the elite are considerable, due to his many stints in provincial government, and there is a chance he could still win."
