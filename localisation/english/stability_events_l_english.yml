 stability.21.t:0 "Draft Dodging"
 stability.21.desc.a:0 "A new report by the War Office shows a marked reduction in available manpower. It appears that the latest batch of recruits is much smaller than initially expected. The discrepancy is currently under investigation, but first leads point towards a large number of people who are technically fit for service managing to avoid the draft through various means. 18 year old students are suddenly skilled workers employed in critical war industry, former athletes fail their fitness tests and in some cases, recruits have simply vanished without a trace.\n\nWhen people are caught and interrogated, they point towards the poor conditions in the army, the indifferent officers and not wanting to die for a lost cause. Military leaders demand a harsh crackdown on people avoiding the draft, but many in the government believe that improving the living conditions of enlisted soldiers might be the better approach."
 stability.21.desc.b:0 "The ineffective official response to the widespread avoidance of the draft has only made the problem worse. More and more recruits never show up after receiving their drafting letter. Counter-Intelligence has intercepted a professionally made pamphlet advising people on how to avoid the draft, suggesting things like bribing doctors to certify the recruit to be medically unfit. Exceptions for family fathers have led to war widows with children finding themselves mobbed with marriage proposals while the number of people applying for exceptions for ethical reasons have hit record numbers.\n\nMilitary leaders have suggested eliminating the last few exceptions and make examples out of a few shirkers that have been caught. Others in the government have suggested that we should appeal to the sense of civic duty in our citizens and point out the consequences of a defeat in this war."
 stability.21.desc.c:0 "With government responses to draft dodging having no positive effects whatsoever, more and more people have started to wonder why they should put themselves at risk while others stay in safety. Recruits that do turn up often report being harassed or ridiculed in the streets as fools fighting for a doomed cause. Reports of mothers forbidding their children from answering the draft order are everywhere, and the War Office has submitted a report claiming that they are no longer sure how many people they are supposed to draft, as their bureaucracy has started to break down under the strain of processing all those missing soldiers."
 stability.21.a:0 "Nothing can be done about it."
 stability.21.d:0 "We should arrest anyone found evading the draft!"
 stability.21.e:0 "A pay rise for the enlisted soldiers is perhaps in order."
 stability.21.f:0 "It is time for harsher measures."
 stability.21.g:0 "Appeal to the people's sense of civic duty."
 stability.21.h:0 "We must make an example."
 stability.21.i:0 "We must give the people something to fight for."

 stability.22.t:0 "Strikes!"
 stability.22.desc.a:0 "Production in several factories has slowed down dramatically over the last few days as the workers have declared a strike on all war production. Demanding "Peace and Bread!", they have so far refused all attempts to negotiate a settlement. Some in the government have advocated a sharp military response, followed by a swift execution of the ringleaders as enemy agents and traitors. However, others in the civil service have recommended a more measured approach, pointing out that a heavy-handed response may well backfire if the soldiers involved are not as loyal as we thought they were."
 stability.22.desc.b:0 "Government efforts to convince the strikers to return to work seem to have had no effect whatsoever. On the contrary, strikes have been reported in further factories, and the last few hold outs in the originally affected work sites have also put down their tools after facing the anger of their colleagues. While stockpiles have so far been able to cushion the blow to front line supplies somewhat, it is only a question of time before the production outages start to affect our ability to prosecute the war.\n\nThe War Office has again urged the government to take an unyielding line with the strikers, but other factions inside the administration have suggested that offering to meet the workers half-way may be enough to convince them to return to work."
 stability.22.desc.c:0 "What started as industrial action in a few isolated places has now spread across the entire country, affecting even industries that are only connected to the war effort in tertiary ways. Even the workings of the government itself have become affected, as many low level clerks, messengers, and drivers have refused to show up to work in increasing numbers.\n\nIn many places, worker councils have taken over the factory buildings. Reports from the secret police indicate that some places seem to have started production of weapons again - for a major uprising against what is being called "The War Regime".\n\nMilitary High Command believes that decisive action by loyal troops could still win the day, while the civilian side of the government argues that this risks a civil war and certain defeat."
 stability.22.a:0 "This will blow over."
 stability.22.b:0 "Make a demonstration of military force in the towns."
 stability.22.c:0 "Make propaganda heroes out of the people still willing to work."
 stability.22.d:0 "Draft the workers into military service and put the factories under military control."
 stability.22.e:0 "Offer to increase the food rations of workers."
 stability.22.f:0 "Send in the troops, arrest the strikers, execute the ringleaders."
 stability.22.g:0 "Propose new welfare legislation."

 stability.23.t:0 "Mutinies in the Army"
 stability.23.desc.a:0 "Alarming news have reach Military High Command about a number of units in our Army refusing orders from superior officers. While none of the units have left their position in the line, representatives of the soldiers have made it quite clear that they will not obey any orders to attack the enemy.\n\nThe rebellion has so far been contained to a small number of battalions and a handful of training and support units, but many in the War Office fear that this uprising will soon spread to other units and may eventually render us unable to continue the war. Decisive action is needed."
 stability.23.desc.b:0 "Efforts to address the mutinies in the army have shown no effect. Emboldened by the lack of effective government response, the mutineers have expanded their list of demands to include an immediate cease-fire followed by a comprehensive peace treaty and demobilisation.\n\nThe War Office strongly recommends that we send a strong signal to the mutineers to deter any further action on their part."
 stability.23.desc.c:0 "With the government evidently unwilling or unable to address their issues, the mutineers have decided to take measures into their own hands. Elections for "Worker and Soldier Councils" have been announced, with the express goal of taking over the country and making peace with the enemy.\n\nUnless action is taken swiftly, these councils may very well end up replacing our government in some areas of the country and render us unable to continue the war."
 stability.23.a:0 "We can't do anything about that now."
 stability.23.b:0 "Surround the mutinous units with loyalists and order them to stand down."
 stability.23.c:0 "Hold a patriotic speech before the mutineers."
 stability.23.d:0 "Publicly announce that anyone found supporting the mutineers will be charged with treason."
 stability.23.e:0 "Announce a peace initiative. Make sure it is unacceptable to the enemy."
 stability.23.f:0 "Mobilise loyalist militias and arrest all soldiers not at their duty stations."
 stability.23.g:0 "Offer the soldiers to permit them to elect their own officers."

 stability.31.t:0 "Military Crackdown succeeds"
 stability.31.desc:0 "Our swift response has proven very effective. Military police units, supported by local law enforcement and patriotic volunteers, swarmed out in a well-coordinated operation to visit every missing draftee. Most were willing to answer the call when they were informed of the consequences of failing to report for duty. Military High Command has publicly declared that anyone who showed up at their duty station will not be charged with any crime or punished for failing to do so in the past. Still, a number of people have categorically refused to take up arms for their country and have been arrested."
 stability.31.a:0 "Decisive action prevented worse."

 stability.32.t:0 "Draft Riots"
 stability.32.desc:0 "Our attempts at resolving the situation through military force have not been met with success. It appears that someone in our administration has leaked our planned operation to the public, which responded quickly. When military police and other law enforcement agencies tried to apprehend known draft dodgers, they found their way blocked by angry mobs, demanding an end to the war and to forced conscription. In several cases, street battles erupted between the police and the protesters, leading to a number of fatalities when the soldiers were forced to use their weapons to defend themselves. It took several hours until the police gained full control over the situation.\n\nAn ugly mood has settled over the capital as the barricades are cleared away and the dead are buried. Reports from the War Office show no change in the number of recruits reporting for duty. Many in the government wonder how much longer we can continue fighting under these circumstances."
 stability.32.a:0 "The situation has not necessarily developed to our advantage."

 stability.33.t:0 "The Conscription Rebellion"
 stability.33.desc:0 "Our attempts at resolving the situation through military force have not been met with success. It appears that someone in our administration has leaked our planned operation to the public, which responded quickly. When military police and other law enforcement agencies tried to apprehend known draft dodgers, they found their way blocked by angry mobs, demanding an end to the war and to forced conscription. In several cases, street battles erupted between the police and the protesters, leading to a number of fatalities when the soldiers were forced to use their weapons to defend themselves.\n\nThe situation quickly spiralled out of control after that, as citizens rushed the soldiers and stormed police stations to arm themselves. Several cities in the country are now in a state of armed insurrection against the government. Ironically, the rebels seem to have no issues finding soldiers willing to take up arms."
 stability.33.a:0 "Oh, so NOW they want to fight!?"

 stability.34.t:0 "Draft Reform proves effective"
 stability.34.desc:0 "The social measures passed by the government as part of a larger process of reforming the military recruitment policy have proven surprisingly popular. Higher pay and more frequent leave are often cited as the biggest new benefits, but many also point to the new government programs to support war widows and orphans. Fewer and fewer men can justify refusing their country's call to the colours, and public support for draft-dodgers has all but disappeared.\n\nIndeed, there has been a recent upswing in public support for the government as more and more people realise that the [Root.GetAdjective] way of life is under attack."
 stability.34.a:0 "A wise decision."

 stability.35.t:0 "The 591. Penal Battalion"
 stability.35.desc:0 "Seeing the severity of the situation, the Military High Command has decided that more drastic measures are required to show that evading one's civic duty to defend their country will not be tolerated. At dawn, military police raided the homes of a number of carefully selected, well known and connected people who have used their influence to allow others to avoid the draft. Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military and escorted to the barracks under armed guard, where they will be formed up into a separate unit, to avoid their subversive influence from spreading to other units.\n\nThe news of this has spread quickly, and it appears that most people who until now believed that they could get away with ignoring their draft notice have changed their mind. Recruitment stations across the country report that a growing number of people have come by to ask what exactly the consequences would be if a "friend" of theirs who had attempted to avoid the draft would turn themselves in."
 stability.35.a:0 "They may yet redeem themselves."

 stability.36.t:0 "Local Elites Voice Their Protest"
 stability.36.desc:0 "Seeing the severity of the situation, the Military High Command has decided that more drastic measures are required to show that evading one's civic duty to defend their country will not be tolerated. At dawn, military police raided the homes of a number of carefully selected, well known and connected people who have used their influence to allow others to avoid the draft. Still in their nightgowns, they have found themselves conscripted into the military. Their families have mobilised their extensive support networks to protest this decision. The War Office has been flooded with calls and letters from simple workers who want their factory manager back to undersecretaries in various other ministries, demanding to know why people working in fields critical to the war effort have been removed from their work. It appears that even some cabinet members have second thoughts about the war - perhaps fearing for the safety of their own sons."
 stability.36.a:0 "Have they no sense of duty?"

 stability.37.t:0 ""A Sombre and Sacred Duty""
 stability.37.desc:0 ""Of course I want to live. I want to go and finish school, I want to meet girls, I want to start a family - but if we lose this war, I won't be able to do these things, either. So I fight."\n\nThe letter, sent anonymously to every major newspaper in the country, has made huge waves. Claiming to be from a soldier who at first tried to avoid the draft, but then realised that he must fight to save his country, it has apparently struck a nerve with many others who felt similarly. Draft boards across the country report that the number of people who still refuse to answer their summons has been more than made up for by new volunteers who will no longer wait until they are called, while others go and fight to save their country and their way of life."
 stability.37.a:0 "We will not let their lives be spent in vain."

 stability.38.t:0 "The end of a coward"
 stability.38.desc:0 ""They led him to the wall at the break of dawn. He refused a last cigarette, but accepted the blindfold. His last words were an apology to his mother for causing her so much pain. The firing squad aimed well. A few minutes later, the doctor present declared him dead."\n\nWhile unable to catch all people who have been evading the draft, authorities have been able to make a number of arrests. Given the grave situation we are in, the War Office has decided that these men be tried under military law for failing to report to duty. The first series of death sentences has been handed down and the condemned have been executed by firing squad. These measures have evidently had the desired effect. It appears that most people decided to choose the possibility of death on the battlefield over the certainty of dishonourable death as a coward."
 stability.38.a:0 "A shame that it had to come to this."

 stability.39.t:0 "A martyr for peace"
 stability.39.desc:0 ""They led him to the wall at the break of dawn. He refused a last cigarette, but accepted the blindfold. His last words were an apology to his mother for causing her so much pain. The firing squad aimed well. A few minutes later, the doctor present declared him dead."\n\nThe published report of the execution of a man sentenced to death for failing to report for duty seems to have had the opposite effect. Rather than bringing people back to the colours out of fear of the consequences, it has made those executed into instant martyrs for the peace movement. Their names and life stories have been published and very clearly edited to make them appear in the best possible light. Mass peace demonstrations have started in several major cities, demanding an end to the war. The War Office reports that they have received a number of letters of draftees stating openly that they will not appear for duty - saying that they would not, under any circumstances, be party to another execution except as the person to be executed."
 stability.39.a:0 "Things have not necessarily improved."

 stability.40.t:0 "A New Deal for [Root.GetNameDef]"
 stability.40.desc:0 "In a radio transmitted speech today, [Root.GetLeader] announced what he called a "Social Revolution". Over the next hour, he laid out a system of reforms that touch every part of social life, promising every returning soldier an education, a well-paying job and a generous pension. He also announced a major building programme for affordable housing for young families, to begin the day an armistice is signed. This appears to have had a significant effect on general morale. Recruitment offices across the country report conscripts appearing and asking about options to extend their service beyond the current conflict, with others all but demanding a posting to frontline units to ensure extra benefits."
 stability.40.a:0 "And we pay for all this how...?"

 strikes_event.1.t:0 "Order Restored"
 strikes_event.1.desc:0 "Moving quickly, Military High command mobilised a number of training units for service and formed ad-hoc groups of soldiers on leave. Marching these formations past the gates of the factories had the desired effect, as most strikers did not want to force a confrontation with potentially deadly consequences. The few that did try to persuade the soldiers to make common cause found their words having little effect as soldiers asked why the workers in the cosy rear should be allowed to let down the fighting men on the front."
 strikes_event.1.a:0 "Why indeed."

 strikes_event.2.t:0 "Bloody Monday"
 strikes_event.2.desc:0 "Moving quickly, Military High command mobilised a number of training units for service and formed ad-hoc groups of soldiers on leave. Moving these formations to the affected cities proved a lot more difficult than expected, however, as the strikers blocked railway lines and forced the troops to march in on foot, giving them ample time to prepare. When our troops reached the barricaded factories, they found the strikers ready for them. Attempts to clear roads were met with furious attacks by the workers throwing stones and bottles at the soldiers.\n\nIn several instances, the troops opened fire to defend themselves, killing a number of strikers and wounding scores more. this only enraged the mob even further, with screams of "Murderers!" filling the air from bystanders. The mood in the capital turned dramatically in favour of the strikers. At nightfall, the soldiers retreated, leaving the barricades intact.\n\nThere have been no further attempts to force the situation. The strikers remain in control of the factories, and no work is being done."
 strikes_event.2.a:0 "Not as planned."

 strikes_event.3.t:0 "Heroes on the Production Front"
 strikes_event.3.desc:0 ""Industrial war is more than just divisions marching and planes bombing. It is more than just the duty of a soldier to fight and die for their country. An industrial war is won, first and foremost, in the factories and foundries. To abandon the battle on the assembly line is no better than abandoning it on the front line. And the victories of the assembly line should be celebrated just as much as the ones won by the front line."\n\nAll available propaganda resources have been rerouted to show the work of the armaments workers in the best possible light. [Root.GetLeader] has personally approved a new award to be given out for workers who have exceeded their quota by more than 100%, and the first recipients have been sent on tours around the country to instruct other workers in their methods.\n\nIt appears that this has made a lot of the strikers reconsider their stance. Work has resumed in all previously affected factories."
 strikes_event.3.a:0 "Heroes one and all."

 strikes_event.4.t:0 "The War Production Department"
 strikes_event.4.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] today announced some small changes to the draft. While skilled workers were previously exempted from the military draft, this exception has now been removed and all exempt men drafted immediately. At the same time, the War Office has been authorised to take direct control of any factory that produces goods relevant to the war effort if the leadership of those factories has shown a lack of ability.\n\nThe announcement was met with silent resignation in the affected cities, especially once it was announced that anyone resisting would be treated the same as a soldier who refused to follow orders. While morale amongst the workers in the factories is at rock-bottom, production has restarted."
 strikes_event.4.a:0 "Should have done that from the start."

 strikes_event.5.t:0 "A country in defiance"
 strikes_event.5.desc:0 "[Root.GetLeader] today announced some small changes to the draft. While skilled workers were previously exempted from the military draft, this exception has now been removed and all exempt men drafted immediately. At the same time, the War Office has been authorised to take direct control of any factory that produces goods relevant to the war effort if the leadership of those factories has shown a lack of ability.\n\nThe announcement was met with great laughter in the affected cities, especially once it was announced that anyone resisting would be treated the same as a soldier who refused to follow orders. Policemen sent to deliver draft notices to workers were told to come back with more than ink on paper."
 strikes_event.5.a:0 "Perhaps we should."

 strikes_event.6.t:0 "Useful Eaters"
 strikes_event.6.desc:0 "Without mentioning the strikes taking place, [Root.GetLeader] announced today that workers in war-relevant industries will get extra rations of sugar, coffee and meat to maintain their strength. Sadly, the rumours that the government was willing to hand out extra chocolate turned out to be false.\n\nWhile the ringleaders of the strike try to keep the workers from returning to work, most seem to have accepted that "Peace and Bread" were never going to happen and are happy with just the bread."
 strikes_event.6.a:0 "They better earn their keep."

 strikes_event.7.t:0 "Operation Black Oak"
 strikes_event.7.desc:0 "The troops assembled outside the towns overnight, maintaining noise and light discipline to keep the element of surprise. As the sun crept over the horizon and the workers manning the barricades at the factories looked forward to relief by the day shift, the assault columns moved in. The tired workers were sluggish to organise the resistance and quickly overcome. Leaving a small detachment to guard the prisoners, the troops swept the town, arresting everyone on the list of known factory workers. By noon, the military had taken full control of the cities and instituted a curfew. No further resistance is expected. The majority of workers will soon be released on the condition that they return to work, the ring leaders will be held and put on trial. Death sentences are expected to be handed down."
 strikes_event.7.a:0 "Order has been restored."

 strikes_event.8.t:0 "The Battle of Oak Street"
 strikes_event.8.desc:0 "The troops assembled outside the towns overnight, but poor light and noise discipline gave the surprise away. As the troops moved in, they found the workers alert and ready for them. The first assault broke down in hails of thrown stones. A second assault with fixed bayonets was repulsed in brutal hand-to-hand fighting, leaving dozens of dead and dying in the streets.\n\nThe officers in charge have pulled back to consolidate their forces, while the workers are extending their fortifications and arming themselves with the weapons left behind in the retreat. A second day of fighting is expected tomorrow, but Military High Command does no longer believe that victory is likely."
 strikes_event.8.a:0 "We are quickly running out of options."

 strikes_event.9.t:0 "The Worker's Rights Protection Act"
 strikes_event.9.desc:0 "With tensions running high across the capital, [Root.GetLeader] announced a new law to protect the rights of workers even in times of war. The sweeping legislation mandates paid sick leave without limits, mandatory accident insurance for every worker, the right to join any union as well as, for the first time, the right for any employed women to have maternity leave after the birth of a child.\n\nWhile many in the government consider this nothing less than a complete surrender to the strikers, the results are conclusive: work has resumed in all factories."
 strikes_event.9.a:0 "Hopefully this will be enough."

 mutiny_event.1.t:0 "Mutiny Crushed"
 mutiny_event.1.desc:0 "After a few hours of tense negotiations at barracks gates and in front line dugouts, the mutiny in our army is over. Faced with the prospect of a fight they could not win, the mutineers quickly decided to stand down.\n\nThe primary issue then became the fate of those that had refused orders. Military High Command has opted for clemency and assured the mutineers that they would not be punished harshly. A few examples have been made in which some soldiers were demoted to a lower rank and transferred to a different unit."
 mutiny_event.1.a:0 "Let's hope that is the last of it."

 mutiny_event.2.t:0 "An empty threat"
 mutiny_event.2.desc:0 "Attempts to scare the mutineers into submission have backfired spectacularly as the troops showed little fear of the units sent to suppress them. Using skills honed on the front lines, they quickly organised a defence of their positions that would make any attempt to defeat them very costly.\n\nThe officers in charge of the loyalist units have pulled back and are awaiting further orders, but this small success has no doubt strengthened the mutineers' resolve."
 mutiny_event.2.a:0 "No one could have predicted this."

 mutiny_event.3.t:0 ""What ARE we fighting for?""
 mutiny_event.3.desc:0 ""It's not uncommon for a soldier to doubt whether what he is doing is really worth it. Can anything justify the sacrifices we ask of you? Can we really demand you to potentially die in pursuit of a goal that you would never see?\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that we must live in the times we were born in. Fate has decided that we must be at war, to protect our freedom, our homes, our [Root.GetAdjective] way of life! We did not choose this war, it was forced on us! You know that I would not ask anything of you that I would not be willing to do myself, and I know that you will do whatever is necessary to secure victory."\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s speech in front of the troops appears to have had the desired effect, as the soldiers broke out in spontaneous cheers and returned to their duties without more than the usual amount of complaining."
 mutiny_event.3.a:0 "Good speech."

 mutiny_event.4.t:0 "The Treason In War Act"
 mutiny_event.4.desc:0 "While the War Office is doing its best to keep the current mutiny in the army from becoming widely known, censoring letters can only go so far. Soldiers on leave quickly spread the word that the army is no longer willing to bleed needlessly in this war.\n\nWithout mentioning the mutiny specifically, [Root.GetLeader] announced today that the government would now consider any act that reflected a lack of commitment to the war to be treason.\n\nThe punishment for treason is well known, and public support for the mutineers has all but evaporated. News of this was, of course, widely spread. Seeing little support from the general population, the soldiers have quietly resumed their duties."

Soldiers on leave quickly spread the word that the army is no longer willing to bleed needlessly in this war.\n\nAttempts by the government to stem the tide have completely failed. Reports from the Secret Police indicate that the mutineers have a strong backing in the general public, making it unlikely that we can isolate and suppress them."

While the causes for this unfortunate turn of events are very complex, the [Root.GetAdjective] demand that the other side pay for all damages caused, disarm completely and publicly acknowledge that they started the war may have been the final straw.\n\nOur enemies have responded in kind, calling our reasonable requests a demand for unconditional surrender. They have promised that they will prosecute this war until the bitter end.\n\nWith our enemies evidently unwilling to see reason and promising to fight on, attempts by the mutineers to force a peace settlement have collapsed."
 mutiny_event.6.a:0 "Terrible shame."

 mutiny_event.7.t:0 "Military Crackdown succeeds."
 mutiny_event.7.desc:0 "Despite a few instances in which small groups of mutineers decided to make a fight out of it, our operation to crush the rebellion has been a stunning success. Relying on numbers rather than skill, loyalist militias surrounded the mutineers' strongholds and demanded their surrender. Most soldiers decided not to take up arms against their own countrymen and surrendered peacefully.\n\nThe ringleaders will be tried in secret court martials, but the average soldier will be sent back to the front, albeit in a different unit to prevent mutineers from forming new cells."
 mutiny_event.7.a:0 "Well done."

 mutiny_event.8.t:0 "Brother against Brother"
 mutiny_event.8.desc:0 "Our attempts to prevent the elections for the Worker and Soldier Councils have escalated the situation beyond even the most pessimistic estimation. Rather than surrendering, the mutineers have formed provisional Councils, elected field commanders and set up defences in the streets. It is clear that they aim to make a fight out of this.\n\nThe rifts in the army now run through every unit and often even between members of the same family. [Root.GetNameDefCap] stands poised at the edge of a civil war."

 mutiny_event.9.t:0 "A new breed of officer"
 mutiny_event.9.desc:0 "Despite strong objections from the military, every unit in the [Root.GetAdjective] Army carried out elections to select their commander.
