 yucatan.2.t:0 "토지 문제"

 yucatan.25.d:0 "Today, there was a terrible discovery in Merida. It seems that some of the bureaucrats in the government were secretly Mexican spies, sent to attack our nation's institutions at the core. Though they have been arrested, there may still be more lurking about."

 yucatan.26.t:0 "Influencing Yucatan?"
 yucatan.26.d:0 "To our north, the Yucatecs have revolted from Mexican rule successfully and are now establishing a government. There are currently many in our nation that seek to reestablish contact with their ethnic Maya brethren in Yucatan. If we used this opportunity to influence Yucatan's politics towards a socialist alignment, we could possibly gain a strong ally to the north."
 yucatan.26.a:0 "Go for it."
 yucatan.26.b:0 "It's too much effort."
 yucatan.27.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Influences Our Politics!"
 yucatan.27.d:0 "The Guatemalan migrants entering our nation have brought more with them than welcome manpower and economic activity - they have also brought radical socialist ideologies with them! We are powerless to stop this trend, as the border to our south is far too porous, and the migrants too valuable, to guard properly."
 yucatan.27.a:0 "Damn them!"
 yucatan.28.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Asks to Join [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
 yucatan.28.d:0 "The socialists in our sister republic of [FROM.GetName] have long watched our progress as we reform Central America into a socialist paradise.
