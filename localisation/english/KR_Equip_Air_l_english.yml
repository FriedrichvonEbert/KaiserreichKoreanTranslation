 BOS_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."

 BOS_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."

 CZE_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit.

 GAL_CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "Without any modern ground-attack aircraft, the Dual Monarchy sought to retrofit existing models to fit the role. The A.101 is the culmination of several attempts at upgrading the A.230 biplane to fill the role. Substantially larger and better armed than its predecessors, the A.101 is capable of both strafing and bombing as effectively as any of its contemporaries."

 GAL_CAS_equipment_2_short:0 "WM.231"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Weiss Manfréd submitted the WM.23 fighter to compete with Avia's design. While its cowling-mounted, motor-driven Gebauer machine guns impressed the Committee, the B.135 was selected instead. Weiss Manfréd responded with a slight redesign, submitting it again as a dive-bomber instead to supplement the ageing fleet of A.101 biplanes in service."
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3:0 "Weiss Manfréd WM.44"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3_short:0 "WM.44"
 GAL_CAS_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed by László Varga, it was essentially a smaller, two-men version of the WM.31 series of heavy fighters and fast bombers. Like its predecessor, it was made out of both wood and metal to increase performance. It proved more than capable, albeit lightly-armoured, for close air support missions."

 GAL_fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "With the Weltkrieg's end, the Phönix company's planned redesign of its famous D.III biplane, with the expected designation 'D.IV', never came to pass. In 1931, however, the company would resurrect the D.IV moniker with the unveiling of an entirely new biplane featuring then cutting-edge specifications. An upgraded variant of the craft, designated D.V, was adopted by the Dual Monarchy in 1933."

 GAL_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "In 1932, Renowned Bohemian engineer František Novotný began work with the Avia company on a new all-metal biplane. This effort would culminate in the B-34, which was very nearly adopted by the Dual Monarchy over the Phönix. Not to be dissuaded, the Novotný redesigned the B-34 with a new engine and chassis, as well as a fully enclosed cockpit. Unlike its predecessor, this model, the B-534, would be adopted by the Dual Monarchy."

 GAL_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "After the success of its B-534 biplane, Avia soon began work on a cutting-edge monoplane which would ultimately culminate in the B-135. It used the Austro-Daimler V12D 860 hp engine and was equipped with a 20mm autocannon in the nose and two synchronised 8mm machine guns in the cowling, giving it great manoeuvrability and accurate fire."

Quickly after defeating Fieseler in a design contest the Hs 123 was adopted by the airforce thanks to it’s all metal construction and superior manoeuvrability. Fitted with a BMW 132Dc engine, it is capable of high speeds and nigh vertical dive bombing attacks. On the testing grounds it proved to be highly reliable and particularly easy to repair."

 GER_CAS_equipment_2_desc:0 "Having realised the need to upgrade from the outdated biplane design of the Hs 123, the Supreme Army Command ordered a new design for ground-attack airplanes. Designed for interdiction of materiel and logistics, the plane had to be thickly armoured for its low-level head-on strafing runs. While initially Henschel used a low power Argus engine it was later switched to a higher power BMW engine, eventually leading to serial production of the aircraft. Due to its high calibre cannon it is often referred to as 'Büchsenöffner' ('can opener') among the troops."

A heavily modified Fw 190, the Fw 152 design development started in 1942 and has such features as increased fuel tanks alongside with speed and much heavier armament compared with the Fw 190.

The newly developed livery helps to disguise the plane better, making it harder for enemy fighters to spot it."

 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_0_short:0 "Ju 86"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc:0 "Ordered as bomber and airliner the Ju 86 is supposed to phase out any Tirpitz era planes within the Air Service. Due to its sturdy all metal construction and retractable main gear it has a very good handling and proves to be popular among pilots. It is widely used among other air forces around the world due to its excellent mid-air stability and good fuel consumption."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Hansa-Brandenburg Mittlerer Bomber 111"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Hb 111"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "With the growing demand of bombers of Seeckt’s Supreme High Command, Hansa-Brandenburg introduced the Hb 111 to support the Ju 86. With its Benz & Cie engine it is considerably faster and like its predecessor widely exported and used among many air forces around the world."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Dornier Bomber 217"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Do 217"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "In order to replace the ageing Ju 86 and the Hb 111, the High Command ordered the production of a new generation of bombers. Designed as a naval bomber the Do 217 was replanned and transformed into a heavy bomber. Better armed than its successor and with the ability to perform dive bombing missions Dornier got the contract without facing competition."
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Junkers Bomber 188"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Ju 188"
 GER_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Ju 188 was designed as a high performance bomber increasing the performance and the payload, following the outdated Ju 88. Even though the High Command is sceptical of the model, test pilots lauded it for its cockpit design. It is powered by two BMW engines and three propellers, significantly improving fuel efficiency and range."

 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Ff 234"
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The development of jet engines had a great impact on the development of fighter and bomber aircraft. Among the first operational jet bombers in the world the Ff 234’s great strength lies in its high speed. Faster than the usual propelled fighter plane it can outrun older enemy planes, making escapes of unguarded flights more likely. Despite its long takeoff runs it is highly aerobatic and favoured by pilots over propeller bombers."

 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Hb 343"
 GER_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Even though the Ff 234 was a breakthrough in its field it still had a few issues. Among them were difficulties with the landing process and target bombing. However both aspects have been improved with the new generation, introduced by the Hb 343, creating an even faster, further reaching and more secure jet bomber."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Dornier Schwerer Bomber 19"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Do 19"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "After von Seeckts army innovation plans, the Air Service was tasked with putting a bigger focus towards strategic bombing efforts. This led to a competition in which the Do 19 came out victorious. A heavy bomber, the Do 19, suffers from a lacklustre performance and little space for bombs, eventually becoming a stopgap product for the upcoming Hb 177."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Hansa-Brandenburg Schwerer Bomber 177"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Hb 177"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed and produced to replace the outdated Do 19, the Hb 177 features a far superior performance and armament as well as a spacious interior capable of carrying almost double the amount of bombs. It’s all-metal construction proved to be sturdier and better to handle, albeit the big size of the plane still caused agility issues in test trials."
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Hansa-Brandenburg Langstreckenbomber 277"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Hb 277"
 GER_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "Direct successor to the Hb 177, only little was changed. While the body remained the same, the biggest changes were the size of the wings and the engines. Instead of being powered by the often troublesome Benz & Cie engines, the Hb 277 featured BMW engines, increasing reliability and performance of the aircraft. The increased wingspan also makes the plane able to reach further away targets."

 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_desc:0 "Designed as a defensive aircraft to protect the airspace from enemy planes, the Bf 163 is truly a unique object. Powered by a rocket engine, the plane is supposed to climb up to high altitude, to then take on enemy bomber groups, while gliding back to the airfield. While the High Command is highly sceptical of the design and its risky tactics, some believe in it to be the air defence of the future."
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2:0 "Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Objektschutzjäger 263"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_short:0 "Bf 263"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_desc:0 "With the Bf 163 showing its weaknesses the High Command has allowed the construction of a new rocket based interceptor model. The Bf 263 is made out of sturdier materials, a pressurised cockpit and a simpler and much more efficient engine, allowing for a doubled combat altitude and a much higher chance of survival for the pilot."
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3:0 "Fieseler Objektschutzjäger 349"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_short:0 "Fi 349"
 GER_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_desc:0 "Designed as a successor to the Bf 163 and the Bf 263, the Fi 349 tried to improve various shortcomings of the other interceptors. The aircraft only needs one pilot with basic training in aiming and firing, as it would be guided by an autopilot. Additionally after the attack the pilot does not need to return to an airstrip to land, but rather is ejected and lands with a parachute. This revolutionary design allows any common man to fly the plane should the need arise."

The plane served well in reconnaissance roles and conducting light bombing. Despite being obsolete when introduced, it was still used until the end of the 1930s as a trainer."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "Mitsubishi G3M"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "G3M"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The G3M was envisioned as a fast high-altitude all-purpose bomber for the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, the underpowered Hiro Type 91 engine meant that the aircraft could not reach its projected cruising speed, let alone the operating altitude. Mitsubishi would continue to modify the aircraft, but backing from within the Navy was lacking after a disappointing first flight. It necessitated intervention from Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku to make sure the aircraft entered service and was able to prove itself."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2:0 "Kawasaki Ki-48 Sōkei"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Ki-48 Sōkei"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Experience from developing the Ki-38 and Ki-45 project proved valuable when designing the Ki-48. The plane was lighter than its fighter counterparts and had little technical issues, with satisfactory payload capacity. Dive bomber pilots were surprised by how responsive the controls were and the capability for the aircraft to perform dive bombing."
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Mitsubishi Ki-67 Hiryū"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Ki-67 Hiryū"
 JAP_tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "Ambitious specifications for a successor to the Ki-48 Sōkei demanded the successor to be heavily armed to fend off interceptors, capable of high speeds and dive bombing as well as the ability to survive heavy battle damage. The resultant Ki-67 would have significantly better survivability compared to contemporary Japanese aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and many armour plates protecting the crew."

 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "R2Y2 Keiun-Kai"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The disappointing performance estimates of the R1Y led to a new design being commissioned by the IJN, which resulted in the R2Y, mounting the Aichi Ha-70 compound engine. An additional study led to the R2Y mounting two Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines and with extra hardpoints on the revised wings. The newly added hardpoints made the Keiun a highly capable high-speed tactical bomber."

 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Ki-190 Ryūjin"
 JAP_jet_tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "A modification of the Ki-67 Hiryū, the Army sought to improve the aircraft’s speed further by mounting a pair of Mitsubishi Ne-330 turbojet engines. Initial mechanical issues aside, the Ki-190 Ryūjin achieved well in excess of 900 kmph for maximum speed during testing and was quickly adopted by the IJA. It would retain many of the features of the Ki-67 Hiryū, while enjoying the high speed provided by a turbojet engine."

 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "Ki-21"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "After the initial testing and competition with the Nakajima Ki-19 design, the Ki-21 was proved to be better, having better speed. However, production was slow and the type only entered widespread service in 1939, by which the aircraft was considerably outdated and obsolete."

 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "Ki-49 Donryū"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed to replace the Ki-21, the Donryū was heavily armed for Japanese standard, with half a dozen light machine guns and a cannon mounted in the rear, while being capable of a higher speed and longer range than bombers in other nations."
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3:0 "Nakajima G8N Renzan"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "G8N Renzan"
 JAP_strat_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "Despite disastrous results during initial testing and the third prototype accidentally catching fire and being destroyed, the G8N Renzan was one of the most well liked bombers. Fitted with the best turbocharger produced by Hitachi, the Renzan was able to reach a higher altitude than most Japanese aircraft, while the range or speed was comparable to any escort fighters."

 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "G12N Shōri"
 JAP_jet_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Due to the promising results of the turbo jet engine programme, the IJN requested the mechanically plagued G10N Fugaku to utilise the Nakajima Ne-230 engine. This necessitated significant rehauling of the airframe and the resulting aircraft was unrecognisable from the Fugaku, essentially being a new design, thus given a new designation and christened the Shōri."
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1:0 "Mitsubishi Ki-46"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1_short:0 "Ki-46"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_1_desc:0 "A lightly armed and fast aircraft, it outperformed the fighters in service at the time of its introduction, but an even more powerful engine was fitted afterwards. It took well into 1939 for an aircraft that was widely produced to be able to catch up to a Ki-46."

 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2_short:0 "J1N1-C"
 JAP_scout_plane_equipment_2_desc:0 "Originally designed as a long-ranged bomber escort, the J1N1 Gekkō was forced into the role of an reconnaissance aircraft after most aircraft firms refused to design a dedicated aircraft due to being overloaded with designing or improving other aircraft. Nakajima suggested modifying the J1N1 Gekkō, and removed most of the forward facing armament, improving the aircraft’s speed by a noticeable margin."

 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_1_desc:0 "After much difficulty, the Japanese intelligence services managed to sneak out a number of design plans for a rocket-powered interceptor from Germany. The design plans were inspected by both the IJA and IJN, and the Navy went on to commission Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to reverse engineer a copy of the aircraft, which became the J8M Shūsui, with similar performances to its contemporaries."

 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_short:0 "Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_2_desc:0 "Typical to the interservice rivalry between the IJA and IJN, the two forces disagreed on the design for the interceptor, with the IJN favouring ditching a cannon for extra fuel tanks and the IJA preferring widening the aircraft instead. Thus, the IJA ordered an independent development of the Navy’s J8M Shūsui, widening the wings and creating the Ki-202 Shūsui-Kai."
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3:0 "Mizuno Ki-156 Shinryū"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_short:0 "ki-156 Shinryū"
 JAP_rocket_interceptor_equipment_3_desc:0 "The possibilities of ultra-high altitude strategic bombers bombing the Japanese mainland worried the Japanese High Command, and as such, they assigned the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal to investigate the possibilities of a high altitude interceptor. The original specifications were then modified to use the successful Mitsubishi Toko-Ro.2 rocket motor also mounted on the J8M Shūsui, with an additional demand of being able to act as a glider. This would result in the Ki-156 Shinryū, partially designed and manufactured by Mizuno, a sports equipment company that also built gliders."

The Amiot 140 is a high-winged cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction, with corrugated wing skinning and a fixed tail wheel undercarriage. Adopted in 1934, the modified Amiot 143 was practically retrained into a night bomber, but due to last-minute modifications, it was adopted according to the BCR classification."

After there capture (or their recovery for the unluckiest ones), our technical units studied a lot these fighters of a new kind. Because the J 21 didn't met the needed requirements to be an efficient fighter, those studies resulted into the J 27, a modern fighter inspired from German and American designs, but mostly from the British Supermarine 'Spitfire'.
