 KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "세계대전의 유산"
 KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "1936년의 여명이 밝아오고, 세계대전의 유산은 새로운 세대의 어깨 위에 올려진 무거운 짐이 되었습니다. 독일 제국은 세계의 중심에 서 있으며 비길 데 없는 강대국이지만, 서서히 그 세력이 부상하고 있는 프랑스의 생디칼리스트 인터내셔널, 옛 협상국들, 분열되지 않은 러시아, 완고한 욱일에 이르기까지, 오랜 적들과 새로운 적들이 독일의 발 밑에서 암약하고 있습니다. 독일 제국은 광대한 영향력을 얻었으나 동시에 위험할 정도로 과다 팽창하고 말았고, 콘스탄티노플을 비롯해 빈의 동맹국들과는 그 관계가 소원해졌으며 대서양 건너편에서는 미국이라는 거인이 흔들리고 있습니다. 전쟁이 끝난지 17년이 지났고, 이번 새해가 전환점이 될 것이라 기대하는 사람은 거의 없지만, 곧 자그마한 불꽃이 화약고에 다시 불을 붙일지도 모릅니다..."

 GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "1919년, 수 년간의 전쟁 끝에 독일군은 마침내 프랑스에서 협상국의 방어선을 무너뜨렸습니다. 그리고 1921년, 영국의 항복이 뒤따랐습니다. 세계대전은 독일을 유일무이한 강대국으로 만들어 주었지만, 1930년대 이후로 독일은 내리막길을 걷고 있습니다. 후퇴하는 세계경제로 독일의 산업이 약화된 반면 다른 국가들의 제조업은 회복되었고, 동부 위성국들에서는 민족주의가 퍼져 제국에서 떠나가기를 원하고 있습니다. 1936년, 독일은 갈림길에 서 있고, 우리는 과거의 적들이 예전의 힘을 되찾는 동안 강대한 제국에 이미 금이 가고 있는 것을 볼 수 있습니다..."
 
### Commune of France ###
 FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "제3공화국은 자신이 시작된 것과 같은 방식으로 고꾸라졌습니다: 독일군에게 패배했고, 본국에서 혁명을 맞이했습니다. 1919년, CGT에 의해 시작된 총파업은 부르주아 정부의 몰락을 초래했습니다. 15년 동안, 새로운 "프랑스 코뮌"은 공안위원회를 비롯한 생디칼리슴-사회주의 사이의 합의의 발판 위에서 단결할 수 있었습니다. 하지만 1936년, 국가를 재건하고 혁명을 수호해야할 필요성은 많은 비판자들에게 낡아빠진 것으로 여겨지고 있고 보다 급진적인 정책에 대한 요구가 커지고 있습니다. 프랑스는 자신의 사명에 확신을 가지고 있지만, 앞으로 어떤 혁명 분파가 권력을 장악할 지는 불분명합니다..."
 
### Union of Britain ###
 ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "1919년 '명예로운 평화' 이후 세계대전은 끝났고, 본토에서 대중들의 신뢰와 지지는 사라졌습니다. 1925년, 재앙이 발생했습니다: 소규모 노동 쟁의가 TUC에 의한 총파업으로 빠르게 커졌고, 노동자들의 파업에 이어 군인들이 탈영하기 시작했습니다. 대규모 폭동의 발생 6주 후, 왕실과 대부분의 엘리트들은 캐나다로 도주했고 대신 새로운 노동조합총회가 정권을 장악했습니다. 영국 사람들은 그들의 섬에 사회주의를 구축하였고 용감한 그들의 유럽 내 동맹국들을 지지했습니다. 그러나 수평선 너머로 폭풍이 몰려오고 있고 곧 갓 태어난 연방은 궁극적인 시험에 들게 될 것입니다..."
 
### Austria ###
 AUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Kaiser Karl's reign continues in Vienna, and since its victory in the Weltkrieg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire remains united under his rule. However, his diverse realms are wracked with division; between the left and the right, and between those who wish to modernise the Empire, and those that wish to keep what they hold, just the way it is. The renegotiation of the Ausgleich, the agreement which brought together Austrian and Hungarian halves of the Empire, is soon approaching. Balancing reform with tradition, and state with nationhood will be no easy task for the Kaiser, and will be yet another challenge for the peoples of the Danube."

### Canada ###
 CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "1925년 혁명 이후, 왕실과 영국인 망명자들은 캐나다로 피신했습니다. 보수당의 지원을 받아 그들은 본토를 되찾을 날을 꿈꾸며 준-공식적인 망명 정부를 설립했습니다. 하지만 모든 일이 잘 풀려가는 것은 아닙니다. 1931년 선거에서 보수당은 매켄지 킹의 자유당에게 패배했습니다. 자유당은 이제 아슬아슬하게 과반수의 의석을 차지하고 있으며 협상국과 제3인터내셔널 간의 피할 수 없는 대립에 대비하라는 압력이 거세지고 있는 상황에서 캐나다의 더 큰 주권을 주장할 것으로 보입니다."

### Russia ###
 RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "러시아 내전 동안, 백군은 가진 모든 것을 가지고 싸웠지만, 적군은 여전히 국가의 산업 중심부를 장악했었습니다. 하지만 독일 제국이 붉은 러시아를 두려워해 백군을 지원하며 개입하기로 결정했습니다. 2년 후, 모스크바와 페트로그라드는 백군에게 넘어갔고 새로운 러시아 공화국이 설립되었습니다. 지난 15년 동안, 여당인 사회혁명당과 입헌민주당의 불안한 연합은 케렌스키 대통령의 밑에서 러시아를 다스려왔지만, 러시아는 점차 불안정해지고 있습니다. 다른 정치 세력들이 성장하고 있으며, 그들은 지금이 바로 변화할 시간이며 러시아의 힘을 세계에 다시 보여주어야 한다고 생각하고 있습니다..."
 
### United States ###
 USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "고립주의를 자처하던 미합중국은 세계대전 당시 개입 쪽으로 정책이 기울 뻔 했지만, 결국에는 전쟁에서 벗어나 있었습니다. 이것은 동맹국의 승리로 이어졌습니다. 그 이후로, 미합중국은 유럽 무역 기회에 있어서 경제적으로 어려움을 겪어왔고 협상국의 빚 상환은 독일의 승리로 인해 불가능해졌습니다. 여전히 국제적으로 '아무 것도 아닌 곳'으로 여겨지는 미합중국은 커져가는 내부의 반대를 마주쳤는데, 공화당-민주당의 독주 체제가 두 단체에게 도전받았습니다 - 바로 생디칼리스트들과 미국제일당입니다. 커져만 가는 본국에서의 위기와 해외에서의 긴장감은, 미합중국에게 좋지 않은 상황입니다..."
 
### Japan ###
 JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "'명예로운 평화'는 식민지에 대한 일본의 권리를 보장해줬지만, 욱일제국에서 모든 것이 잘 풀린 것은 아닙니다. 경제적 동요 이후 1926년 생디칼리스트의 히로히토 섭정-왕자 암살 시도로 그 극에 이르렀고, 불안정한 정부는 또 다른 위기의 해를 보냈습니다; 첫 문제는 다나카 장군이었고, 다음은 민주 연립 내각이었으며 그다음은 중국 북동부에 대한 개입이었습니다. 1936년, 일본은 제국을 확장할 태세를 취했습니다. 독일의 지배가 쇠퇴하고 있는 것으로 보이는 가운데, 일본인들은 남은 청나라의 영토와 독일의 태평양 지역들을 탐내고 있습니다..."

### Serbia ###
 SER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "1925년의 다른 유명한 혁명에서, 세르비아인들은 마침내 군주제를 전복하고 발칸에서 자유와 민주주의의 밝은 빛인 세르비아 공화국을 세웠습니다. 지난 10년 동안, 공화국은 바르톨츠 조약의 제한을 겪어왔지만, 오스트리아가 약해진다는 첫 번째 징후는 확실히 그 족쇄가 던져지는 것을 보게 될 것입니다. 세르비아인들은 마침내 이루어낸 자유를 지키면서 세계대전에서 잃었던 것을 되찾고 유고슬라비아의 횃불을 다시 밝힐 수 있을까요?"
 
### Bulgaria ###
 BUL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "'발칸의 프로이센'은 1919년 최후의 전투에서 승리하였습니다. 차르 페르디나트의 수는 성공적이었고 대불가리아는 영원히 통일되었습니다. 그러나 지난 20년은 불가리아에 친절하지 않았습니다. 위기와 민족 갈등으로 동요되어 불가피한 다음 전쟁을 대비하지 못하고, 민주주의에 대한 희망이 빠르게 희미해지고 있습니다. 페트코 스타이노프 총리가 의장을 맡는 새로운 자유주의 집중이 형성되었고, 타르노보 헌법을 수호하거나 아니면 어둠 속에서 내버려 둘 마지막 기회를 얻었습니다."
 
### Haiti ###
 HAI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "미국의 공식적인 점령이 끝난 지 4년 후, 아이티는 벼랑 끝에 놓였습니다. D.P. 칼릭스테 장군은 2년 전 부패한 미국의 꼭두각시였던 루이 보르노 정부를 무너뜨리고 대통령직을 장악했습니다. 흑인 노동계급의 이름으로 현 정부에 반대하는 혼혈 엘리트 세력은 반 칼릭스테 연합을 이끄는 엘리 레스코 아래 결집했습니다. 칼릭스테 대통령은 아이티를 평화와 번영의 새 시대로 이끌 수 있을까요? 아니면 영원한 어둠 속으로 사라지게 될까요?"

### Past Nations ###
####################

### Poland ###
 POL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nearly two decades after the Act of November 5th, the throne of Poland still sits empty even as claimants of various nationalities jostle over it. With this so-called eternal regency looming over Poland, the population grows more and more restless, and various radical ideas are starting to take hold. Tensions are increasing across Europe, and with them the pressure on the Regency Council. The question looms large: will they be able to agree to elect a king before the patience of the Polish people runs out?"

### Lithuania ###
 LIT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania was founded after the Weltkrieg as a monarchy closely tied to the German Empire - its vast non-Lithuanian population and ceaseless nationalist resentment marking its history up to today. The old king, Mindaugas II, passed a long time ago, and his heir is widely seen as a step backwards, lacking both the character and the skill to rule. While nefarious forces plot in the open and in the shadows alike, can the Kingdom survive the challenges ahead, however impossible they may seem?"

### White Ruthenia ###
 WHR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "White Ruthenia, formally the Belarusian People's Republic, has been under German influence from its birth on March 25, 1918. Thanks to the distance from Berlin, it was mostly left to its own devices, and the Belarusian Social-Democratic Party became the dominant political party, continuing the young republic's pro-German orientation. Nevertheless, the BSDP remains divided between moderates and radicals, and the army is deeply suspicious of the latter's influence. Time will tell whether one or the other upset the fragile status quo."

### United Baltic Duchy ###
 BAT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Baltic German nobility got what it wanted from the Weltkrieg - a restoration of the rights and privileges which Russification policies trampled over and a state they could call their own, the United Baltic Duchy. Here, under the reign of Duke Adolf Friedrich, the Four Baltic Knighthoods rule a decentralised monarchy, the sentinel of aristocratic tradition. But pressure mounts to reform this byzantine system, and the Duke has pushed through a liberal, reformist government to see the changes through. When everything is against them, however, can the Baltic German dream survive?"

### Kingdom of Bhutan ###
 BHU_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been just under thirty years since the petty lords of Bhutan were brought to heel under the benevolent rule of the first Bhutanese king, Ugyen Wangchuck. Since his death in 1926, the kingdom has nearly been torn apart by rival claimants and the loss of its British patrons, dashing away any opportunity for real reform and leaving Bhutan as a remote and backwards remnant of the feudal past. In recent years, however, the young King Jigme and his reform-minded allies in the royal court have begun the process of dragging the nation into the 20th century. Will these reformists be successful, or will a new force take form in the Himalayas?"

### Georgia ###
 #GEO_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the Russian civil war in full swing, the Menshevik stronghold in Georgia was able to slip away, first as part of the Transcaucasian Federation, then as the Democratic Republic of Georgia. Following a string of agreements with Germany and the Ottoman Empire, Georgia was safe, and under the charismatic leadership of Noe Zhordania, decades of peace and relative stability was achieved. However, Zhordania grows old, and is planning on retiring. With tensions rising across the Middle East, the peace he's brought may go with him..."

### South Africa ###
 SAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Some would say South Africa is the place where the British Empire's decline became visible to the world: the trouble they had pacifying the insurgent Boers laying bare the rot which would later cost them the Great War. Britain eventually did prevail against them, and from the ashes arose the Union of South Africa in 1910, a British Dominion. Since then, the Empire collapsed, and now South Africa, in its new role as the last vanguard of British influence on the African continent, is on a crossroad: is its dominion status beneficial as prime minister Jan Smuts asserts? Or has the time come for South Africa to seize its destiny for itself?"

### National France ###
 NFA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Defeated and facing revolution, the French government chose exile, expecting the newly-established “Federation of the Communes of France” to collapse. As months turned into years however, the Republic slipped into parliamentary chaos. The armed forces stepped in, forming a thinly-veiled junta under Philippe Pétain. A decade later the regime has stagnated, held together by the ageing Marshal whose reputation is smeared by accusations of despotism and nepotism. With unrest brewing, the French Republic stands at a crossroad but one thing is clear: her sacred duty to free the Métropole. The Exiles prepare for any opportunity to strike..."

### Jabal Shammar ###
 JBS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once rulers of Arabia, the Rashidi dynasty has come a long way since its peak in the late 19th century. A resurgent Ibn Saud and questionable loyalties amongst their allies have put the Emirate of Ha'il on the back foot, forced to ever more increase its reliance on the Ottoman Turks. To make matters worse, the dynasty is plagued by scheming and intrigue with various ambitious princes eyeing Saud's throne all for themselves..."

### Ottoman Empire ###
 OTT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although the Ottoman Empire finished the Weltkrieg as a victor, the once-unstoppable empire has lost much of its former glory. The ever increasing rate at which it lost its far-flung possessions has been decisively halted but at what cost? Even after its beating, the Ottoman Empire still stands however and the reformist spirit, initiated in the 19th century, has only increased in vigour. Still, sharp disagreements rule the Chamber of Deputies as the centralist OHF under powerful orator and war hero Mustafa Kemal Pasha takes up the fight against the liberal coalition in a battle to decide the future of the entire Middle East..."

### Cyrenaica ###
 LBA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When Muhammad ibn Ali al-Sanusi founded the Order in 1837, the armies of Christianity were bearing down on the last Muslim states of Africa, Central Asia and the Middle East. In a desperate attempt to turn the tide, our Order embarked on trans-saharan campaigns in the French Sudan and Chad, fighting to preserve the independence of these states and spread the message of our Grandmaster. Pushed back, we saw our territory slink until in 1911 the homeland came under direct attack. Although Italy, after almost a decade of guerrilla warfare, was pushed back into the sea, the French colonial empire still stands, still watches, still hungry..."

### Egypt ###
 EGY_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "As a colony of the British Empire, Egypt was forced to side with them in the Great War. Yet, with the signing of the Peace with Honour, the anger of the Egyptians would boil until the day the British Revolution in 1925 exploded. In the Chaos, the Egyptian people launched their own revolution to throw out the British, lead by the Sultan of Egypt. As 1936 arrives, the Sultanate's eyes go increasingly upon the Young Farouk, who is being groomed for the throne. And with the decline of the Ottoman Empire, members of all political parties begin to make plans restoring the might of Egypt and dream of an Ottoman-free Middle East..."

### Romania ###
 ROM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Treaty of Bucharest ended Romania's war with the Central Powers. While it was considered lenient, its restrictions were enough to fuel a stab-in-the-back myth that, after several crises in the 1920s, overturned the nation's political establishment. The death of King Ferdinand and the country's leading liberal politician would pave the way to two highly ambitious men: King Carol II and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. The two joined arms to overthrow Romanian democracy and launch a crusade to reunite Romania, but how long can these two strong personalities work together before their ambitions clash in the open?"

#### Costa Rica ###
 COS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Class warfare, rapid militarisation and the Iron Grip of the Kaiser hold the world in its grasp, which makes it even more peculiar that in the midst of all this violence and pain we can find the tiny republic of Costa Rica. Taking great pride in their impressive literacy statistics and their unbreakable dedication to the Constitution, the nation stands as a rock above its neighbours who have long been eyeing its land. As their greatest ally starts to descend into chaos, vultures all across the Americas are waiting for the proud eagle to fall. Diplomacy will have to prevail if we are to survive the coming tide..."

#### Cuba ###
 #CUB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A mere seven years since the overthrow of American-backed dictator Gerardo Machado, Cuba again teeters on the edge of political upheaval. The regime of young President Rafael Trejo has steadily lost control over the Army and the civilian government's political authority has all but completely eroded. As radicals both right and left threaten the country, the military may well take full control as soon as an opportunity presents itself."

#### Denmark ###
 DEN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Denmark exists under the shadow of Berlin. Its relation with the new hegemon of the world is ancient, has often been hostile, even as recently as 1864, which resulted in the loss of Slesvig to the Germans. Yet, in 1936, ties are warm and Denmark, by grace of having remained neutral in the Weltkrieg maintains its sovereignty in full. Under the guiding hand of the popular social democratic prime minister Thorvald Stauning, Denmark has been profiting from German economic prosperity. Domestically, the future looks bright, but internationally, clouds are gathering. Some fear Denmark will be in the wrong place at the wrong time..."

#### Dominican Republic ###
 #DOM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The American Occupation of the Dominican Republic ended in 1924 and full political control was returned soon after, but within a mere few years, the nation's new democratic constitution would face challenges both within and without. While Democracy has so far survived in the nation, the schism of the long-ruling Red Party has again put the constitution's survival in jeopardy."

#### Fengtian Government ###
 FNG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Shanghai Conference of 1928 left Fengtian as the sole inheritor of the old Beiyang Republic's legacy. As before, democracy is maintained only as a thin veneer, and real power is divided between a wide variety of unscrupulous autocrats.\n\nZhang Zuolin, his ambitions limited by the stark realities of Qing strength and Japanese power, has been forced to walk a political tightrope above the machinations of his own divided government. The outlook is grim, but some still hold out hope. The Five Colour Flag may again flutter high above Beijing and across all China..."

#### Finland ###
 FIN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the northern periphery of Europe, Finland, the bastion of German influence in Scandinavia, proudly stands. Spawned out of the corpse of the Russian empire and with socialism threatening the nation at its inception, the kingdom has developed into a stalwart ally of Germany against the principles of socialism and the imperialistic hands of Russia. But after almost two decades of independence under the guiding hand of its monarch and the national coalition, unrest is festering: is Finland truly free or is German dominion merely a bit more subtle than that of the Tsars of old?"

#### Guatemala ###
 #GUA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The overthrow of the two-decade-long president Manuel Estrada Cabrera in 1920 and the overthrow of the Unity Party afterwards has led to a decade long dictatorship under José María Orellana. Through various compromises, he has been able to keep power by a string through the Americans and various outside influences. However, the rise of Sandino in Nicaragua has caused extreme trouble for his presidency as socialist movements begin to grow and the Unity Party officials begin to ally with elements of the military. Orellana's dictatorship might have its string cut soon."

#### Honduras ###
 #HON_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The suicide of President Andino in 1933 following the peasant charge of the capital created a shock wave throughout Honduras, soon after a peasant republic was established with the goal of gradually rooting out US influence and purging Pro US elements. In 1936 the Council is on the brink of collapse and there are rumours of a conspiracy within the government..."

#### Iceland ###
 #ICE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Starting in 1874, Iceland had its first taste of independence when Denmark granted the colony home rule. When the guns fell silent after the Weltkrieg, Iceland joined the Mitteleuropa Economic Bloc which brought a period of prosperity to the island. However, this economic prosperity would not last forever. The British Revolution of 1925 shattered the miracle that post-Weltkrieg Iceland was experiencing. The last decade has seen Iceland floundering as its economy never fully recovered from the loss of Great Britain. Many politicians are now bringing forward further plans to revitalise the island."

#### Italian Republic ###
 ITA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, the country was left to the mercy of the Austrians - and it would have been reorganised into the old Italian Federation had it not been for the outbreak of civil war. The socialists would have overrun the peninsula had the Austrians not swallowed a bitter pill and cooperated with the republicans... and, after the fighting stopped, was forced to maintain the relationship into the current day. Italy remains unstable, however, and its eventual reckoning with the socialists across the Po appears inevitable."

#### League of Eight Provinces ###
 LEP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sun Chuanfang's League forms the southern half of an axis that has dominated China for nearly a decade. Years of peace have proven fertile ground for ambition, and with it jealousy. Although Nanjing and Beijing remain united against external foes, they have become competitors as much as allies. Some say the costs of this contest have already begun to take their toll.\n\nLike much of China the League is the product of a careful balance, and Sun's great bureaucratic pyramid may have already begun to crack and crumble..."

#### Ma Clique ###
 #XSM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The three Ma families have cemented their north-western rule for thirty steady years. Siding with almost everyone in China at one point or another, with some Mas even fighting each other for the sake of remaining on the good side of everyone, the Mas are now seen as one of the greatest allies of the new Zhili-led Qing Dynasty.\n\nOf course, not all is well. Ma Fuxiang's heart attack three years ago shook the clique, and a sense of anxiety and unrest has slowly spread ever since. For now, the northwest is peaceful, but its future is less certain than many might like to believe..."

#### Mexico ###
 #MEX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico has come out through the Mexican Revolution changed. During the 1920s the presidencies of Álvaro Obregón and Adolfo de la Huerta would see improved relations with the United States of America while stabilising the country from the revolution. The Great Depression in America has allowed Mexico to embrace the ideas of the Revolution which they have started when they elected Emiliano Zapata as President in 1932. Now with two years left in his term, and the revolution seemingly done, Zapata looks to plot the future course for Mexico."

#### Nicaragua ###
 #NIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The occupation of Nicaragua by the United States Marines in 1926 ended in disaster as the liberal revolutionary general expelled them and set up his new 'Revolutionary Republic' within Nicaragua. It soon drifted towards a socialist attitude and underwent not insignificant development but it is not without its troubles. The expelling of large amounts of American companies has left a hole in the economy and the entire eastern side of the country is unofficially demilitarised after a stern warning of entering the region from the Americans. With the elections soon will Nicaragua's fate finally be changed?"

#### Norway ###
 NOR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "For Norway, the last two decades could have been better. As a neutral country supportive of the British war effort, the hegemonic power of Germany did not favour the land of the midnight sun and the nation was excluded from the Mitteleuropa project that did include Sweden and Denmark. When Great Britain fell to the hammer and torch, the last trading partner of Norway that was not subject to heavy tariffs was an ocean away. Ever since, Norway found itself in diplomatic and economic isolation, and in the suffering this entails, the syndicalist-inclined Labour Party rises in the polls at an ever-increasing pace."

#### Papal State ###
 #PAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the formation of a united Italy, it had seemed the time for the Papal States to have secular power was a thing of the past. Then came the collapse of the kingdom, and the civil war which followed, and central Italians once again turned to the Papacy and its Sicilian allies to help maintain stability. Now Pope Pius XI is ill, and on his deathbed he laments an Italy that remains divided, with the syndicalists growing ever stronger in the north. Whoever his successor is, he will need God on his side in order to prevail."

#### Patagonian Workers Front ###
 FOP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite the belief that a revolution in the arid wastes of Patagonia would be impossible, the Frente Obrero Patagonico has managed to endure against all odds. Thanks to an opportune Chilean intervention forcing Argentina to accept the new status quo or face a war unprepared at a time of great economic hardship, the FOP has managed to grow in numbers, drawing people disillusioned with the old regime in Argentina. However, the ties that bind the different factions in the FOP are thinner than they look from afar, and perhaps victory in the civil war will only be the match that will set off the powder-keg..."

#### Qing Empire ###
 QIE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Qing Empire enters 1936 on the brink. Restored in exchange for German support during the fourth Zhili-Fengtian war in 1927, the Xuantong Emperor remains deeply unpopular and is viewed by many as illegitimate.\n\nThe Zhili clique, who trounced both the Fengtian clique and the KMT, stands as the victor of the chaos that engulfed China since 1911, but their domination of the country is far from secure. Enemies from both outside and within threaten their hegemony, and it remains to be seen how long they can hold on to power..."

#### Sardinia ###
 #SRD_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The House of Savoy was shattered by Italy's defeat in the Weltkrieg, and King Victor Emmanuel III held responsible. All is not completely lost for the monarchy, however. The Savoy-Aostas are powerful supporters, the rightful holders of Sardinia-Piedmont until their lands on the shores were swallowed up by the syndicalists. Now they and what monarchy supporters they can gather hold out on Sardinia, protected by the French Republic and ready to watch for the opportunity where they, too, can one day return home to claim their seat of power."

#### Shandong ###
 #SQI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Shandong's ruler Zhang Zongchang is preceded only by his armoured train and a monstrous reputation. The 'Dogmeat General' is known for violence, vice and corruption, and under his hand the capital of Jinan has steadily come to mirror its master.\n\nHowever, from the peak of Mount Tai, the elusive patriarch Zhang Tianran eschews the depravity below. Instead, he hopes to turn back China's clock by over a century and guide the country into the arms of his captivating Yiguandao faith. A clash between these contradictory forces may change China forever..."

#### Shanxi Clique ###
 #SHX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Unlike most other warlord factions, Yan Xishan's Shanxi clique has retained a policy of guarded neutrality for nearly three decades, broken only in times of great threat or great opportunity. Both presented themselves in 1928, and Yan joined Zhang Zuolin against the newly reformed Qing Government.\n\nUnfortunately the subsequent defeat deprived Yan of the eastern portion of his province and forced him to induct Guominjun remnants to bolster his wavering forces. The consequences of 1928 are far from forgotten, and next time Yan must choose a side he must do so wisely... "

#### Sichuan Clique ###
 SZC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Sichuan has long been a microcosm of China's many woes, divided and constantly switching controllers since 1911. Yang Sen managed to emerge from the chaos as ruler with help from Wu Peifu's Zhili Clique, but even his control is far from absolute.\n\nFollowing a destructive Tibetan invasion, Yang has come to rely upon internal factions for support, most notably Liu Xiang's Industrial Corps and Deng Xihou's Baoding Department. Meanwhile, the exiled Officer Department has returned to the south with support from Yunnan. The Sichuanese powder-keg may explode once again..."

#### Socialist Republic Italy ###
 SRI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the Italian civil war, the Socialist Republic of Italy has controlled the bulk of Italy. Its rulers know full well that it would have overrun the republicans and the whites, had it not been for the infernal interference of Austria and the pressure applied by Germany. Even today, it is the spectre of interference by Germany and Austria which keeps syndicalism from finishing off the last remnants of Old Italy. The nation bides its time, building its strength, and is fully aware that - once the scale tips - it shall tip in the favour of revolution."

#### Sweden ###
 SWE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the last decade, Sweden developed itself as a bastion of conservatism under the prosperous rule of prime minister Arvid Lindman, profiting from the fruits of the economic growth in Mitteleuropa during the late 1920s and early 1930s. However, clouds are gathering over Stockholm: in 1934, Arvid Lindman retired as prime minister and has been succeeded by the less charismatic Gösta Bagge, while the social democratic opposition is rallying around their popular party leader Per Albin Hansson. This year Bagge's first elections as prime minister will be held. Can he hold his ground? And if not, can Sweden's democracy survive this sudden reversal?"

#### Two Sicilies ###
 #SIC_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies initially sided with Austria during the civil war, a necessary evil to halt the advance of the Socialist Republic. Later, however, when war with the syndicalists seemed inevitable, the Austrians showed their true colours and abandoned the south. The war never happened, but the Sicilians came into the modern era wiser. They will have a difficult time meeting the more industrialised north head-on, but that war will someday come and they must be ready for it."

#### West Indies Federation ###
 WIF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The West Indies Federation was created as a result of the collapse of the British Empire in 1925 due to being unable to exert the influence to control the region directly. After the incorporation of the French colonies in 1927, the country has been home to not only a noticeable class divide but a cultural and ideological one as well. The people and new generation have seen a noticeable drift towards socialist attitudes and preference towards the communards on the mainland. All it could take is one wrong step before chaos erupts on the Indies..."

#### Yunnan Clique ###
 YUN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the German re-establishment of the Qing dynasty, the mountainous border province of Yunnan was forced to change its strategy. Governor Tang decided to kowtow to the new Qing Empire, while at the same time opening Yunnan's doors to republican remnants, in order to cement his autonomy and deter action against his notoriously upstart province.\n\nAlthough the situation in China is slowly starting to favour Tang's schemes, it is also beginning to shatter any illusion of provincial unity, as many internal factions no longer see Tang as fit or even sane enough to rule..."

### Belgium ###
 BEL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the Weltkrieg ending, the nation of Belgium found itself transformed into the Kingdom of Flanders-Wallonia. The country, suffering a major economic downturn and having a population unwilling to accept the pretender Adalbert, struggled throughout the years after Versailles. Yet the nation may change its course drastically. The syndicalists, supported from across the border, and the royalist, desiring to invite the Soldier King back, wait for an opportunity. Flanders-Wallonia may see a storm coming its way. The question is: who shall be standing after it passes?"

### The Netherlands ###
 HOL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While preserving neutrality in Europe, the Netherlands faced all the fiercer challenges in their colonies. The Insulindian Independence movement grows bolder by the day, and the grand days of the Dutch Navy are long gone. And even in Europe, things could be better; the Netherlands have always had a special relationship with Germany, particularly economically – which means the rising economic problems in Germany could extend to the Low Countries. And all of this comes at a time in which a rising number of the Dutch people falter over French syndicalism or the dreams of a Greater Netherlands..."

### Greece ###
 GRE_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The years since Greece's loss in the Weltkrieg have seen little but upheaval and hardship. The crippling war debts to Austria and Germany sent King Alexander fleeing into exile as the Third Republic was declared... only to result in years of failed governments and coups until Georgios Kondylis took control in 1926. Kondylis was finally overthrown and executed in 1931, leading to the current Fourth Republic and the coalition government of Geórgios Papandreou which won its first election, which will face many challenges in the next several years, not least of which are renewed calls for a referendum on the monarchy's return. The outcome is very uncertain..."

### India ###
 RAJ_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Too little and too late, the Anglo-Indian Treaty of 1925 could not bind the Jewel to the Empire. After the Revolution in the homelands, the leadership of the Indian National Congress convened a provisional government in Calcutta. In the confusion of the ensuing civil war, the southern princes rebelled from the Delhi government, prolonging the civil war until 1928. The uneasy truce between the three Indias – the Syndicalist Bharatiya Commune, the Princely federation in the South and the Entente-loyal Delhi government - has held since then, but all three seem to be gathering steam for a new round of conflict over the legacy of the late British Raj..."

### Siam ###
 SIA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Initially neutral during the Great War, Siam joined the Central Powers at the last minute in 1919 to regain Champassak and the inner Cambodian lands along the Mekong Line. Siam nonetheless became embroiled in the 36th Siamese-Burmese War with the newly independent state of Burma in 1928. The great Siamese nation was able to defeat the Burmese successfully, and it was only with German and Japanese diplomatic intervention was an agreeable ceasefire was reached. Now, as the year 1936 dawns, the Siamese nation continues to enjoy peace, prosperity, and stability, with King Prajadhipok hoping to unveil Siam's first constitution."

### German East Asia ###
 GEA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the British collapse in 1926, the Kaiserliche Marine has been an undisputed master of the Eastern Seas, and the guardian of the western order in the Orient. The retreat of the British 'China Station' to Australasia left her Asian colonies and concessions vulnerable to insurrection, and in need of protection only Germany could offer, completing a string of colonies and concessions from Suez to Tsingtau. However, Deutsche Ostasien exists not as a colony, but instead as a jurisdiction; a stretch of territory in which the admiralty must balance local interests, contend with varying colonial systems, and ensure the protection of it all...""

### Brazil ###
 BRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The terrible wounds of the 1927 civil war may never heal, but Brazil marches towards progress, even if at it's own pace. Secret Voting and increased state autonomy were the main achievements of the conflict that ensured that true democracy finally reached the people of Brazil, and it's economy finally begins to recover from a decade of downturn. With the game of politics radically changed, came new players; civil unrest brought Syndicalism and Integralism to mainstream politics, as the coalition led by Otávio Mangabeira struggles to keep order in the streets, continue to develop the nation, and keep up on it's expensive dreadnought race with Argentina and Chile."

### Argentina ###
 ARG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Chaos reigns supreme in Argentina as the LP under Manuel Carles is in the midst of a military coup to take full control of the country. Meanwhile syndicalist supporters are still holding on to their rump state in Patagonia, thwarting all offensives thus far. Pressured by the fact that war is all but unavoidable, industrialisation has been kick-started in the nation out of necessity. While initial reports indicate some success, there is a long way to go..."

### Paraguay ###
 PAR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Despite emerging victorious from the Chaco war, Paraguay doesn't find itself in an enviable situation: extremely high military expenses, a very undeveloped economy and the country not having recovered yet from the 1870 war which killed more than half of its population means that Paraguay's economy is basically nonexistent; also, an unstable situation on the southern border and the syndicalist menace of Rafael Franco in exile in Chile mean that the Guarani republic might soon find itself fighting for its own existence."

### Uruguay ###
 URG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After decades of instability, the Oriental republic of Uruguay finds itself in a prosperous and stable state: neutrality in the Weltkrieg and the institution of the National Administration Council in 1919 meant that the Uruguayan economy was able to prosper during these years despite the loss of one of their biggest commercial partners. Should its agricultural economy collapse, however, the situation may deteriorate really fast and open possibilities for extremists to destroy the stability and neutrality of this fragile nation..."

### Australasia ###
 AST_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nearly two decades after the Great War, Australasia still hasn’t healed. Unbelievable, catastrophic manpower losses and sacrifices in the Great War all for naught have led to an atmosphere of cynicism and hopelessness as the once-great British Empire crumbled to pieces. The economy is a complete dumpster fire, a natural consequence of the fall of the United Kingdom and the ensuing loss of exports that followed. The shadow of the syndicalist Melbourne Commune still haunts the continent, but there are still plenty who haven’t forgotten the Empire and are ready to reclaim its birthright..."
