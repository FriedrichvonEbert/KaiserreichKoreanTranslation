Now with the Flanders itself an independent nation, a new push is being made by our government to convince the Zeeuws-Flemish people to join our country, thus securing our access to the Scheldt and consolidating our hold on the southern bank.\n\nTwo main proposals are being considered: the moderate wing of our government insists on pushing for a referendum, letting the people decide for themselves. Meanwhile our more aggressive political figures are keen to implement plans for a more direct path to integration.

 fln.13.d:0 "After seizing the territories around Lille and Dunkerke from Flanders during the reign of Louis XIV, the French have made extensive efforts to undermine the Dutch language and marginalise the Flemish community. After the syndicalist revolution many of these Flemish nationals fled over the border to West-Flanders, awaiting German intervention to return to their homes. Centuries of French indoctrination however have undoubtedly left their mark and only a small Flemish minority still exists in the region making our claim weak at best.\n\nAs a result of the tensions in the region, a commission has been established, one tasked with improving conditions for the Flemish minority and to enthuse the rest to adapt to our language and culture."

 fln.14.d:0 "Still devoutly Catholic, most of the Flemish living in Frans-Vlaanderen listen intently to their doctor and their pastor.

 fln.15.d:0 "While all contact with the Communard government in France is strictly forbidden, we can still covertly send money and resources to the Flemish companies and workers that live there. The continuation of the Caritas programme, invented by the Catholic Church, is intended to help the working class and by properly backing it we could increase the welfare of locals in the region and boost their sympathy towards Flanders. There are risks however, as this would undoubtedly be a very expensive project and it is unclear whether any meaningful results could be guaranteed."

 fln.16.t:0 "Frans-Vlaanderen Restored to Flemish Rule!"

A large renaming programme is already under way with cities like Lille changed to Rijsel and Dunkerke to Duinkerke. Putting aside extra government funds for refugee care and the restoration of the area could help us gain sympathy at little cost, and it would assist greatly in the integration process."
 fln.16.a:0 "Allocate funds for refugee camps and repairs."
 fln.17.t:0 "Francophone Protests"
 fln.17.d:0 "Due to extensive efforts by the French government to increase the importance of the French language in the region, large swathes of land have become monolingual French and are resisting their new Flemish occupiers. To quell their resistance, we could allow the continuation of French facilities in those areas. This would decrease the amount of civil unrest in the region, but would unfortunately decrease the speed at which it would be successfully reintegrated into Flanders."

 fln.19.t:0 "Bombing of the Yzer Tower"
 fln.19.d:0 "Built after the Weltkrieg to commemorate fallen Flemish soldiers, the tower of Yzer has become a symbol of Flemish nationalism and peace. During this year's annual Yzer pilgrimage organised by members of the Frontpartij, a French anarchist has blown up the tower causing the total destruction of its support structure and the death of twenty-three Weltkrieg veterans. The Flemish public is outraged calling for a decisive and brutal response from the Vlaamse Wacht."

 flnrev.1.d:0 "The nation of Flanders-Wallonia was only shortlived. Beset by widespread corruption, an absolutist monarch and corrosive German favouritism, it was only a matter of time before the powder keg inevitably exploded. Finally the Flemish have left the union and can finally for the first time in recent history celebrate their independence. From Oostende to Brussels to Hasselt Flemish lions are being paraded through the streets and across the nation chants of the Vlaamse Leeuw ring out. Still, such public displays of jubilation are little more than a front for the politics that happens behind closed doors."

 flnrev.2.t:0 "Foundation of the Flemish National Congress"
 flnrev.2.d:0 "With the German king ousted and the nation liberated, the once united parties of the revolution are slowly breaking apart. The Flemish Council claims that they are the only legitimate government and that only they should lead the nation until things have calmed down. The Catholic Party, the largest in the nation is divided with members of the Council supporting this regency and members who were seated in the pro-German Parliament. Neither group wishes to give up their power or allow their administrative organs to be abolished. The VWP is resolutely against any continuation of the old system as it forbade their participation and the party is continuing to bolster relations with the still armed revolutionaries. The Liberation army meanwhile is torn between allegiance to the Catholic Party and their self appointed leaders who are vying for control of the state."
 flnrev.2.a:0 "The First National Congress ends in failure."
 flnrev.3.t:0 "The Council Seizes Control"
 flnrev.3.d:0 "To preserve their power and keep the national situation under control, the Flemish Council has, with the assistance of the Vlaamse Wacht, seized control of the Assembly stationing forces at all entrances and throughout the surrounding city blocks. Van Severen has used this opportunity to stand before the Assembly and give his speech, trying to convince them of the necessity of stability and preservation of the old system. While he has mild success in convincing some members, most of them are waiting for the Liberation army to launch a counter-attack against the Vlaamse Wacht and liberate the Assembly."
 flnrev.3.a:0 "The situation is escalating."
 flnrev.4.t:0 "Divisions Within the Liberation Army"
 flnrev.4.d:0 "With the Assembly being kept hostage, the Liberation army is increasingly becoming plagued by internal strife and divided leadership.\n\nLed by Charles Claser, the Secret Legion stands by the dissolution of the Flemish Council and the creation of a new Flemish state. The Frontbeweging on the other hand, mainly composed of Weltkrieg veterans, stands by the Flemish Council and has been tearing men away from the combined effort to support the Vlaamse Wacht. The Geuzengroep is torn apart between its founding members who were part of the Vlaamse Wacht and the recruited partisans who fought out of anti-German sentiment and general discontent with the Flemish Council.\n\nA fourth faction has also emerged during the rebellion, consisting of mainly Dutch volunteers and Groot-Nederlands sympathisers. While their numbers are limited, support from the Dutch army and a stalemate between the other factions could result in their victory.\n\nWith no end in sight, the different factions are seeking the disarming of the others and to use the influence of both Church and State to achieve their goals."

 flnrev.51.d:0 "By sowing discontent in the ranks of the Frontbeweging and winning over the recruits of the Geuzengroep, the Secret Legion has been able to convince enough members of the resistance to their cause to force total disarmament on the other factions. While most of them have agreed with these terms and laid down their weapons, small pockets of radicals still remain throughout the countryside trying to gain the support of farmers and royalist civilians."
 flnrev.51.a:0 "Move on the capital!"
 flnrev.52.t:0 "Clashes Between the Vlaamse Wacht and the Secret Legion"
 flnrev.52.d:0 "The Secret Legion has finally achieved enough control to liberate the Assembly and are moving into Brussels trying to break the Vlaamse Wacht's strangehold over the city and the national leadership. Inside the Assembly, Van Severen is still trying to convince members to support the continuation of the Flemish Council but word is spreading through the ranks that the Libertion Army is moving in."

 flnrev.53.a:0 "A provisional government is established."
 flnrev.61.t:0 "The Frontbeweging Unifies With the Geuzengroep"
 flnrev.61.d:0 "Efforts by the Secret Legion to win the support of the Geuzengroep recruits have been successfully repulsed and even though their member count has dropped, reinforcement of the movement by experienced veterans of the Frontbeweging has enabled the combined group to consolidate their power and face the Secret Legion head on."

 flnrev.62.t:0 "Clashes Between the Secret Legion and the Frontbeweging"
 flnrev.62.d:0 "Seeing themselves as the last protectors of Flemish liberalism, the Secret Legion has entrenched itself in West-Flanders, recruiting civilians and repulsing attacks by the combined movement.

 flnrev.63.t:0 "The National Assembly Gives In"
 flnrev.63.d:0 "Either convinced by the speeches of Van Severen and other Council members or pressured by the armed forces outside, the Assembly has given in and voted in favour of maintaining the continued existence of the Flemish Council. While all parties openly support the decision, behind the scenes plans for a more democratic government are being created."
 flnrev.63.a:0 "The Flemish Council rules supreme."
 flnrev.631.t:0 "Destruction of the Secret Legion"
 flnrev.631.d:0 "After their victory in Brussels, the forces of Flanders have turned their eyes back to West-Flanders where the last remnants of the Secret Legion have embedded themselves. By offering full amnesty to all who surrender as recognition of their deeds in the liberation of Flanders, many Legion members surrendered to the Flemish forces allowing for a swift end to the surviving extremist elements."

 flnrev.641.d:0 "With the Flemish Council firmly in power and reinforced by the Vlaamse Wacht, the Frontbeweging has agreed to lay down its arms. Prominent members of the movement have been awarded seats in the Council and have created their own party: the Frontpartij. They are strong supporters of the independent Flemish nation and have petitioned for a rewards program for successful Resistance members."

 flnrev.81.t:0 "The VNV and Van Severen Unite"
 flnrev.81.d:0 "Due to the most unfortunate resignations of some of staunchest royalists in the Council and their replacement by VNV nationalists, Van Severen has acquired a slim majority. A vote on the continuation of the Regency will be the first point on the agenda during the next session and it looks set to be easily repulsed by his followers."
 flnrev.81.a:0 "Dark times are approaching."
 flnrev.82.t:0 "Resistance From the Frontbeweging"
 flnrev.82.d:0 "While the Frontbeweging supported the Council during the early days of the nation, this have heavily frowned upon its power grab. Many members of the movement have publicly spoken out against Van Severen in the Council, switching sides to the royalists. Though this is a mild setback for Van Severen's plans, further replacement of the Council members should still sway the vote in his favour."

 flnrev.83.t:0 "End of the Regency"
 flnrev.83.d:0 "With a small majority, Van Severen has been able to win the vote thus ending the Regency and replacing the monarchy with a more autocratic regime. The Flemish Council now retains full control of the Government and decides on all matters of state. While new members can still enter the Council, most seats are reserved for Van Severen's most loyal supporters thus repressing any real form of opposition."

While their impact so far has been fairly limited and their size is diminishing due to German and now Flemish policies, the VNV has urged the Council to take a more forceful approach. They have demanded the complete abolition of French education and the unification of the VUB and ULB.

Borrowing heavily from the disintegrating Van Severen faction, the conservative Catholics and some of the Liberals, the movement is steadily growing in power and confidence. Sensing an opportunity to increase his power in Flanders, Adelbert has offered the movement both monetary and political support."

While they are still the smallest faction in the Liberation Army, they are starting to sway popular opinion by promoting the Flemish unification with the Netherlands and a stronger global Flanders. Without the armed support that the other factions enjoy however, they are unlikely to be able to achieve these goals.

While siding with the Secret Legion may guarantee a shot at winning the coming elections and free promotion of the movement, siding with the Frontbeweging has its own benefits. Van Severen has already shown strong tendencies towards a pro-Dutch unification stance and siding with him may fulfil our goals."
