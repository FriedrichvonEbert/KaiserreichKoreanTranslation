 dei.1.t:0 "1936년 동인도 제도"
 dei.1.d:0 "1925년 생디칼리슴 폭동이 없었다면 네덜란드 제국이 가진 '왕관의 보석'은 안정의 횃불이 되었을 것이고, 네덜란드가 새로운 시장에 상품 (설탕, 커피, 석유)를 판매하기 위해 미텔오이로파와 가까워진 덕에 이익을 보았을 것입니다. 현재 제대로 다시 강화된 독일의 경쟁력에도 불구하고, 이러한 경제 성장은 그럭저럭 이어졌으며 안정도 같이 찾아왔습니다.\n\n하지만 그뿐만은 아닙니다. 네덜란드 정부는 'de oost' 없이는 네덜란드가 살아남을 수 없다 믿으며 어떠한 독립에 관한 요구도 묵살했고, 사람들의 독립 열망은 점점 거세지고 있습니다. 식민지 정부의 많은 사람들은 경제가 침체된다면 1925년이 반복되거나 더 나빠질 것을 우려하고 있습니다..."

 dei.2.d:0 "검은 월요일 사건 이후 유럽을 강타한 경제적 어려움의 결과는 세계대전이 끝났을 때부터 상품을 미텔오이로파 시장에 팔았던 네덜란드령 동인도제도에서도 곧 느껴질 것입니다. 평범한 유럽인들이 더 이상 설탕이나 커피를 살 여유가 없게 되면서, 해당 상품들의 가격은 붕괴하였고 이는 농민들에게 큰 영향을 끼쳤습니다."
 dei.2.a:0 "안 돼!"
 dei.3.t:0 "독립 운동의 단결도가 올라가다"
 dei.3.d:0 "The PID is reporting that the unity among independence movements has been growing lately. It would be prudent to keep a watchful eye over them and to stop them from growing stronger (and preferably weakening their unity), lest their collaboration result in a stronger movement overall."

 dei.4.t:0 "독립 운동의 단결도가 떨어지다"
 dei.4.d:0 "The PID is reporting that the unity among independence movements is faltering and now even falling. While it would be unwise to sit back and relax now, we will have less problems controlling them soon as cracks in their collaboration begin to show."

 dei.7.d:0 "Our Governor-General Bonifacius de Jonge had mentioned multiple times that he intended to resign from his post as governor-general of the Indies, but delayed it in the light of the Dutch elections, that were increasingly showing to become an electoral feast for his patron party, the VNH, back in the Netherlands. For better or worse, the elections are over now, and it will remain to be seen who the new minister of colonies will appoint as his replacement."

 dei.8.d:0 "The Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge has announced his intend to resign, having waited for the election to do this so that the new government could appoint the new governor-general without the need of him being replaced within half a year which would, in De Jonge's eyes, be harmful for the stability of the Indies.\n\nMultiple candidates have come forward, but only one can become Governor-General..."

 dei.16.d:0 "The Volksraad, the largely powerless 'parliament' of our colony, has passed a petition of Soetardjo Kartohadikoesoemo, calling for a conference to speak about the future of the Dutch East Indies, specifically in terms of promoting it to an equal status within the kingdom. With it being passed it is now the task of the Governor-General to send it back home. The Volksraad is merely an advisory legislature however, and the Dutch and Indo population is concerned about the implications of the petition, so we could also simply veto the whole deal."

Apparently, the petition calls for a congress to speak about the future of the status of the Dutch East Indies within the kingdom. The Volksraad has already removed all time limits the original proposal included, so the prime minister made his choice already when to handle it in the house of representatives."

 dei.19.t:0 "Sutardjo-Petition Rejected"
 dei.19.d:0 "The homeland has rejected the Sutardjo-Petition we've sent to them about a year ago, with most of those voting against it citing the fact that the Dutch East Indies is an overseas territory and not a colony that can be uplifted to equal status. Obviously, the real reason is that they think the Insulindians aren't ready for self-rule, and it seems obvious that the Insulindians won't be happy with this."
 dei.19.a:0 "All's well that ends well!"
 dei.20.t:0 "Sutardjo-Petition Accepted"
 dei.20.d:0 "The homeland has accepted the Sutardjo-Petition we've sent to them about a year ago, although they did remove all the time limits. They know full well the implications of such a conference, so assurances are sought that we handle it with care, and only when we are ready. The door, however, is open for promoting the Indies to an equal status."
 dei.20.a:0 "The Inlanders will be pleased."
 dei.21.t:0 "Formation of GAPI"
 dei.21.d:0 "As a result of the rejection of their plan for a conference, all Inlander parties (with exception of the PNI) have merged into a singular Insulindian Political Federation, calling for the full implementation of an Insulindian parliament and thus for Insulindian equal status once more. As the Dutch government is obviously unwilling to fulfil this wish, especially in the light of rising international tensions, this will only help unite the Inlanders in the independence movement."

While this is a setback, it seems unlikely at current that we will be able to take the island by force as we lack the Dutch naval capacity.

Though we have never really seen eye to eye with the Dutch, they still provided a level of stability to the region, and like us, see the Japanese as a threat to that stability.

Unsurprisingly, chaos ensued, with Sukarno, just released from prison, taking advantage of the situation to declare Insulindian independence. Meanwhile the Governor-General is missing, and mercenaries took over control our part of the island of Borneo. The Indies are collapsing just because of this statement."

The first reports indicate that Sukarno and his national party will take control over the Indies, who will at best be indifferent to our rule, and at worst hostile. While a military expedition to pacify the Indies is asking for trouble, we could decide to move to take as much of formerly Dutch New Guinea as possible and secure the formerly Dutch side of the strait of Malacca."

 dei.41.d:0 "The Congress of Batavia started, representatives from all over the Indies have arrived to negotiate over the future of the Dutch East Indies and it being raised to equal status with the Netherlands.\n\nThe first contentious issue is what these new countries within the kingdom will be. Most nationalists seem to favour a solution where Java and Sumatra are united, Borneo and Celebes are their own countries and another state called 'East Insulindia' which includes the Moluccas and overall, the Christian part of the land. Many (Dutch and Eastern Indonesian) are afraid however, that such a Java-Sumatra state would go on to dominate the new kingdom of the Netherlands and would rather see both islands be split up into several countries. Then, there is the middle ground, where both Java and Sumatra are their own countries within the kingdom."
 dei.41.a:0 "Keeping the countries small and controllable is preferable."

 dei.42.d:0 "The next contentious issue is the way the kingdom would be ruled overall. The countries within the kingdom have full internal autonomy, but some oversight should there, especially when changes need to be made to the constitution, all representatives agree on that. The Dutch argue that the Netherlands should lead this group with all other countries sending their representative to the council of ministers of the kingdom. The Insulindian representatives strongly reject that notion, declaring that it would be undemocratic, and that each country should be represented in this council dependent on its population."
 dei.42.a:0 "No, this still is the Netherlands..."

 dei.43.t:0 "바타비아 회담"
 dei.43.d:0 "Several smoothly agreed upon issues came along, when another highly contentious one appeared near the end of the conference: foreign policy. Obviously, the countries stand together under the kingdom, but the Dutch want to control foreign policy when it doesn't directly concern any of the other countries, while the Insulindians would much rather see a unified foreign ministry that is set up by the autonomous countries together. Once this issue is resolved, it will be voted on by the States-General."
 dei.43.a:0 "We are obviously right..."
 dei.43.b:0 "The Insulindians are right."
 dei.44.t:0 "The Outcome of the Batavia Conference"
 dei.44.d.dutch:0 "The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was pushed significantly to the pro-Dutch side, and it doesn't seem like the Insulindians were very happy with it. It is probably enough to secure limited cooperation, but not enthusiasm except in the Moluccas perhaps."
 dei.44.d.balanced:0 "The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was a good mix between pro-Dutch and pro-native policies, and while perhaps, secretly, both the Dutch and Insulindians had hoped for more, neither is dissatisfied with it either. It is probably enough to secure anything but limited cooperation in the western part of the Dutch East Indies, but at least there is a lot of enthusiasm about this solution in the Moluccas, lesser Sunda islands and Western New Guinea."
 dei.44.d.insulindia:0 "The delegates at the Batavia conference have come to a conclusion. It is clear that the conference was weighted towards the Insulindian side, making many Dutch people uncomfortable, feeling like their country will never be the same anymore. The Insulindians are happy with it however, especially outside Java, Sumatra and Borneo."
 dei.44.a:0 "The proposal is accepted!"
 dei.44.b:0 "The proposal is rejected!"
 dei.47.t:0 "The States-General Rejects the Proposal"
 dei.47.d:0 "The States-General unexpectedly rejected our proposal for the new Insulindian status in the near future. Needless to say, the Insulindians are not amused with this sudden rejection of their rights!"

 dei.48.d:0 "After significant negotiations, it is time to sign the Koninkrijksstatuut; the royal charter. In this, our colonial possessions become autonomous countries within the kingdom, ruling themselves while still being part of the kingdom of the Netherlands, and subjects from each country will get Dutch citizenship. It also should note that independence has been promised, though clauses have been written in to ensure this happens in decades not years..."

 dei.52.t:0 "[DEI.GetLeader] Dissolves the Volksraad"
 dei.52.d:0 "Early in the morning, governor-general [DEI.GetLeader] issued a decree suspending the volksraad once and for all, proclaiming the institution was only meant to make Dutch rule weaker and only helps outlaws like Sukarno. From now on loyalty to the crown will be the foremost goal of the Dutch East Indies and not the petty complaints of the small Inlander majority in the volksraad that previously had to be consulted. Some critics say this is more to extend [DEI.GetLeader]'s personal power, but this is clearly nonsensical."
 dei.52.a:0 "It was the right thing to do!"
 dei.53.t:0 "[DEI.GetLeader] Dissolves the Volksraad"
 dei.53.d:0 "News has arrived from the Dutch East Indies, where the governor-general has suspended the volksraad, the legislative body that already didn't have a lot of power, for a currently unknown amount of time - possibly forever. He argues that the body was being used by Inlanders to undermine Dutch rule."
 dei.53.a:0 "If it's for the good of our rule, it's justified!"
 dei.54.t:0 "The Dutch Issue Greater Taxes"
 dei.54.d:0 "With the black Monday crisis haunting the Dutch homeland, the Dutch government decided to issue additional production-obligations from us, not considering the fact that the crisis had hit our industries right here too. Unsurprisingly, while this action will help the Netherlands, it will make our work harder, as independence activists get greater steam arguing that we are only here to exploit them."
 dei.54.a:0 "This is a mistake!"
 dei.59.t:0 "Anarchy in the Dutch West Indies"
 dei.59.d:0 "A disturbing turn of events has happened: the native population in Insulindia, the basis of the Dutch exiles has ousted their former colonial master. With its head cut off the snake once more, the Dutch empire is no more: upon the news reaching the west indies, anarchy has struck these colonies. Now we have no choice but to occupy them."
 dei.59.a:0 "It is our humanitarian duty."
 dei.60.t:0 "Enticing Foreign Pilots"

It lacks modern arms, a command-and-control structure, and the other basic needs that are currently being address with a new budget being drawn, and the slow merging of several commissions to help streamline the modernisation of the KNIL."

All power, no matter how the political situation was laid up back at home, now rests with the queen, who is now set to appoint the first exiled Dutch cabinet; will she solidify her rule by creating a loyal cabinet or will she instead form an ARP-cabinet, her all-time favourite?"
