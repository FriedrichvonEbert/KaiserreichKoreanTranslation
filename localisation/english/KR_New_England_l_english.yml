 POLITICS_LEWIS_BARROWS_DESC:0 "Born in Newport, Maine on June 7th, 1893 - Barrows studied in local schools around Newport before attending the University of Maine with a degree in pharmacy. His political career began to take off after holding local positions in Newport such as serving as the treasurer and as an eventual state committeeman under the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos in 1936, Maine remained unscathed from much of the violence and Barrows made sure that Maine would remain free from radicalism under his leadership as Maine Secretary of State.\n\nWith the arrival of the second civil war among the states of the former United States of America, Barrows along with prominent New England politicians and governors were among those who appealed to Canada for protection. Representing what is left of the Republican Party, Barrows has been nominated to serve as an interim president in the hopes of securing the eventual restoration of American democracy. Serving alongside President Barrows is Vice President Henry Styles Bridges, the former governor of New Hampshire. A teacher and businessman, Styles Bridges was the youngest state governor of the time and now is eager to join Barrows' administration."
 POLITICS_DAVID_WALSH_DESC:0 "Born in Leominster, Massachusetts, on November 11, 1872 - Walsh attended local public schools in his youth before attending Boston University Law school, after which he was admitted to the bar. Rising to politics in a longtime Republican district as a Democrat, Walsh proposed increased government responsibility for charity work and the mentally ill and pushed for censorship of the racist film "Birth of a Nation." Indeed, Walsh is a staunch opponent of the racism that pervades American society; in the 1924 Democratic National Convention, he condemned the Ku Klux Klan. A champion of modern labour standards, Walsh has found a robust voting base among the working classes of New England.\n\nNoted for his political populism and seemingly luxurious lifestyle, Walsh served successful terms as Massachusetts's first Irish-Catholic senator. When the great civil war broke out, Walsh quickly ascended to the head of the Democratic Party in New England. A prominent advocate of isolation during the Weltkrieg, Walsh has attracted the annoyance of his Canadian neighbours due to his anti-imperialist views. While Canadian-American ties are ever closer, Walsh's anti-interventionist stances will surely bring conflict between the two nations.\n\nServing alongside President Walsh is none other than former Rhode Island Senator Theodore Green. A vigorous member of the Democratic Party despite his age, Green stands opposed to Walsh's isolationism - instead of believing that America's path lies in aiding the rest of the free world."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_MARTIN_JR_DESC:0 "Born in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, on November 3, 1884 - Joseph Martin Jr came from an Irish New England family and spent his youth playing ball and working as a newspaper editor. A so-called "compassionate conservative," Martin supports the use of conservative techniques and concepts to significantly improve society's welfare.\n\nAscending from a career of local and then state politics for Massachusetts, Martin secured a position in Congress as a Representative for the Republican Party. As the nation descended into chaos and a new interim President was hastily chosen, Martin was elected on a combined coalition party of Democrats and Republicans.\n\nHis Vice President is the former Democratic governor of Massachusetts and conservative Democrat Joseph B. Ely. Achieving fame among New Englanders due to his handling of the Great Depression, Ely has been chosen by the compromise committee due to his role in combating unemployment and poverty. While the tensions between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party still exist, a house divided against itself cannot stand in America's darkest hour."
 POLITICS_WILBUR_CROSS_DESC:0 "Born in Mansfield, Connecticut in 1862 - Cross is renowned across the American literary scene for his talented work in analyzing English literature. From academia, Cross competed for the position of governorship for the state of Connecticut of which he won successfully. With the outbreak of the civil war, Cross finds himself in a precarious position following the Canadian occupation of New England. One of the many Americans who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene, Cross's openness to embrace the Entente's arrival into America has led some to suspect that he is no more than a mere puppet of the former British Empire. While he is on paper the leader of a provisional government led by Ottawa, he is also the temporary interim leader of New England until a suitable President is chosen."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_HURLEY_DESC:0 "Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 24th, 1893 - Hurley's early life was marked with tragedy as he lost both his parents at a young age. He was then raised by the family housekeeper, a former US District Attorney, before attending Boston College and becoming a salesman in athletic goods. Hurley then embarked on a career in local politics before ascending to the position of Massachusetts State Treasurer for three consecutive terms as a Democrat. The success of his political run convinced him of greater political aspirations, and he ran successfully for governor in the 1936 election. As the nation descended into chaos, the Irish-American governor sought to resolve tensions between Yankee Protestants and Irish-American Catholics. In the wake of the destructive 1938 New England Hurricane, Hurley oversaw the relief and rebuilding efforts for the city of Boston.\n\nNow the newly elected 33rd President of the United States finds himself in a much greater position, the defender of American democracy in the wake of radicals and reactionaries. Serving alongside Hurley is fellow Democrat Peter Gerry, a wealthy senator from the state of Rhode Island. Gerry was tutored and mentored by none other than Canadian politician William Lyon Mackenzie King in his youth."
 POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "Born on the East Side of New York City on February 23, 1889 - John Winant came from a prosperous family and attended Princeton University, although his marks were relatively poor. After a brief stint in the army, Winant entered state politics by elected to the New Hampshire Senate. Following a successful career in the Senate, Winant ascended to Governor of New Hampshire under the Republican Party from 1925-1927 and then from 1931-1935. He achieved state-wide fame for his handling of the decades-long economic depression that had beset America. Active in the Square Deal policies that helped end the depression in New England, Winant has easily been chosen among his party to lead New England onwards in its most challenging days. Following his governorship, Winant ascended to the powerful position of being the American ambassador to Canada where he played a hand in the many interactions between the Provisional Government and the Canadian nation. The 33rd President of the United States faces a broken nation but is eager to reunite and take its place once more as the hegemon of the New World.\n\nServing alongside Winant is Frederick Hale, a Maine lawyer and Senator from Harvard University. A long-time Republican and chairman of the Committee of Canadian Relations - Hale has espoused fierce anti-Ku Klux Klan views in public and has not been afraid to denounce them."
 POLITICS_RAYMOND_BALDWIN_DESC:0 "Born in Rye, New York on August 31, 1893 - Raymond Baldwin's home state became Connecticut after moving there at a young age and spending his college years at Yale. Baldwin participated in the Stratford Town Court as a prosecutor, eventually advancing to judge of the town court in 1931. As the country fell apart, the governor of Connecticut, Baldwin, was among those who petitioned the Canadian government to intervene due to the civil war. To ensure the safety of the people of New England, Baldwin supervised a complex array of civil defenses and statewide services on the homefront which grew his popularity within the Republican Party. He certainly has his work cut out for him as the nation reels from the horror of the great war - only time will tell whether or not Baldwin's hand will lead to prosperity and peace in the future.\n\nServing alongside Baldwin, New Yorker Irving Ives, a man whose family dates back to the first settlers who settled in New England. Re-elected many times in the New York State Assembly, Ives publicly expressed his desire to end workplace discrimination based on race, creed, and colour. Together, both men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Republican Party."
 POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Born in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 22, 1901 - Tobin's Catholic and Irish heritage has led him to become deeply popular among Boston's Irish population. He briefly worked at Conway Leather and New England Telephone after graduating from Boston University until he entered politics as a protege of the esteemed Democrat James Michael Curley. At just the young age of 25, Tobin was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, which he served from 1925-1929. A fiscally conservative man, Tobin then became mayor of Boston serving the city without authorizing large public scale projects. His career as mayor was rocked by the Coconut Grove fire, but the scandal did not stop the ambitious Tobin from running for President. An energetic and vigorous member of the Democratic Party, Tobin became elected as the 34th President, securing for the Democrats four more years in the White House. The nation waits to see what the new President will do, especially those involved in labour as Tobin has been a constant supporter of labour unions and socially liberal policies.\n\nServing alongside Tobin is James Farley, an Irish-Catholic New Yorker and member of the Knights of Malta. A fierce fighter for civil rights, especially for African-Americans, Farley has announced he will supervise the rebuilding of the nation's postal service and significantly improve its airmail capabilities. The two men have vowed to reunite and rebuild America once and for all under the leadership of the Democratic Party."
 POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Born in New York City on November 15, 1891 - William Harriman, also known as \"Averell\" Harriman, was born into a life of wealth as his father was railroad baron E.H. Harriman. During his academic career at Groton School and Yale University, Harriman made contacts that led to the large firm \"Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.\" During the 1930s, Harriman's properties grew to include the Union Pacific Railroad, the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation, and the Polaroid Corporation. His immense wealth painted Harriman as an enemy in the eyes of the Syndicalists during the years leading up to the civil war. During the ensuing chaos, Harriman fled north for the Provisional Government of New England, where he joined the Committee of Canadian-American Relations and helped coordinate the joint war effort between New England and Canada. Through this position, Harriman gained the experience necessary to become the American ambassador to Canada - helping aid in the close relations between the two nations.\n\nReceiving the nomination of the Democratic Party and following his victory in the 1948 election, Harriman has become the 35th President of the United States of America. The new President has a lot of work cut out for him as the full signs of recovery are beginning to show, and the years of reconstruction are finally coming to an end. Serving alongside Harriman will be the former governor of New York state, Herbert H. Lehman. A supporter of the Second Square Deal during the provisional government era, Lehman has publicly stated his support for the guaranteed rights and wages of the working class."
 POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Born in Dummerston, Vermont, on August 20th, 1892 - Aiken developed a strong interest in agriculture early, a passion that he would carry on in his career as governor of Vermont. A Republican, he ran unsuccessfully for the Vermont House of Representatives in 1922, but he ran successfully in 1930 and 1932. He ascended to the position of Lieutenant Governor in 1934 and became governor in 1936, just as the nation descended into chaos. As governor of Vermont during the civil war, Aiken helped organise work projects to alleviate the economic stress caused by years of the great depression. A proponent of spending projects for rural America, Aiken holds great affection for the natural beauty of his home state, although these views put him at odds with old-guard Republicans. With his background in agriculture, he portrayed himself as the defender of farmers and the common folk - with this stance and popularity, he accepted the Republican nomination for the campaign of 1948.\n\nNow the 35th President of the United States, Aiken faces a nation finally shaking off the dust after years of economic woe and instability. Serving alongside Aiken is Robert Bradford, the Republican Lt. Governor of Boston, and a man from a long-time traditional New England family. During his time as governor, Bradford emphasised fiscal conservatism but social liberal values as seen in his project such as housing and care for civil war veterans."
 POLITICS_THOMAS_DEWEY_DESC:0 "Born in Owosso, Michigan, on March 24, 1902 - Thomas E. Dewey attended the University of Michigan, where he briefly contemplated a career in singing. After a throat ailment convinced him a job in such was risky, Dewey instead pursued law which brought him to New York City. First serving as a federal prosecutor, Dewey achieved headlines in the 1930s by prosecuting gangster Waxey Gordon. With an excellent memory, Dewey used his details of crimes and telephone taps to bring down criminal organisations. Unfortunately for Dewey, however, the great civil war forced him to flee from New York City and head north to New England, where he would serve as governor in 1942, 1946, and 1950. Regarded as an honest and effective governor, Dewey banned racial discrimination in employment and increased state aid for education and salaries for state employees. His Postwar "Reconstruction Fund" helped the city of New York recover after years of brutal civil war that had utterly devastated the metropolis, and with such fame, he achieved the Republican nomination in 1952.\n\nSecuring the election of 1952, Dewey is now the 36th President of the United States and leads a mighty America, years of civil war and instability long behind her. Serving alongside him is the grandson of the legendary American oil baron John Rockefeller, Nelson Rockefeller. A noted art collector, businessman, and politician, Rockefeller has been noted for his liberal and progressive views despite his Republican background."
 POLITICS_CHARLES_BOWLES_DESC:0 "Born in Springfield, Massachusetts, on April 5th, 1901 - Bowles came from a Republican family who hated and feared big government. However, Bowles' political views were shaped by his aunt Ruth Standish Baldwin, a socialist and friend of Norman Thomas. After graduating from Yale University, Bowles became an advertising executive, although he was forced to flee from New York City due to the arrival of the civil war. Initially opposed to Canada's involvement in American politics, Bowles joined the America First Committee, although he voiced his support for New England after the provisional government entered the fray. After the civil war, Bowles led the Office of Economic Stabilisation, using his years in economics to help rebuild the nation's war-torn economy. In 1948, he became governor of Connecticut, defeating James C. Shannon signed the end of segregated national guard units and acts to improve mental health and housing.\n\nNow the 36th President of the United States, after securing the election of 1952, Bowles plans to lead a new America, one willing to help develop the world's weaker nations. Realizing America's restored industrial and military might be better used to serve the world, Bowles will push for greater American world involvement to keep the peace. Paul Dever, the governor of Massachusetts and a former Lt. Commander in the Civil War, will be serving alongside Bowles. The youngest ever Attorney General of Massachusetts, Dever's governorship saw mental health reforms and efforts to resist domestic syndicalism."

While some questioned whether or not that would remain true as the nation descended into chaos with the outbreak of the second civil war - it appears that even in times of crisis, the New England faith remains as true as ever! After years of construction, the second largest church in New England was finally dedicated to the great happiness and satisfaction of Lewiston's French-Canadian population.\n\nDuring the mid 19th century, Lewiston experienced an influx of French-Canadians who came to work at the local textile mills. These Catholic migrants desired a place for worship, and for a time, the parishioners worshipped in the basement of St. Joseph's Church. Because of the large number of French-speaking parishioners, the weekly mass was moved to the nave of St. John's in 1872. But the number of parishioners simply outgrew the nave, and thus the construction for a new church began with the cornerstone of St. Peter's set in 1872. In 1881, the Dominican Fathers of Lille, France, and Quebec took over the administration of the church, and by 1889, the parish was known as S. Pierre S. Paul de Lewiston, Maine. By 1905, the parishioners numbered 10,000, and the splitting of the parish from 1907 and 1923 led to further delays on the project. Serious work on the project resumed in 1933 despite the ongoing Great Depression, and finally, it was completed in July of 1936.\n\nIts completion finished, now the church has finally been dedicated by the Diocese of Portland. The church's two organs, both made by Casavant Frères, a Canadian organ building company in Quebec, were also dedicated this year. Not only does the completion of the church reaffirm New England's traditional values of piety and religious freedom, but it also reflects the growing ties of the French-Canadians to their adoptive country."

 newengland.18.d:0 "The right to free speech has always been a pillar of American democracy. While strikes and protests characterised much of the early 1930s, the government hardly cracked down on these acts of disobedience unless they grew violent. One of the techniques utilized by strikers would be the \"sit-down strike,\" a form of civil disobedience in which workers seized their workplaces by \"sitting down\" at their work stations.\n\nNonetheless, in a groundbreaking case made by the Supreme Court; the government of New England has ruled that participants of sit-down strikes could be fired and defeated a decision made by the National Labor Relations Board that declared that sit-down strikers could be reinstated. At the General Electric Plant in Schenectady, workers attempted to form a union. The company sent a labour spy into the union as the union began to clamor for a renegotiated contract. The company's continued refusal to compromise with the union led to the frustrated union to organise a sit down strike - shutting down a portion of the plant. After multiple attempts, police who were called to eject the strikers were finally successful. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ordered the company to reinstate the fired strikers, arguing that the company's actions before the strike were illegal. The case was brought to the attention of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes who ruled that \"sit-down strikes\" were \"good cause\" for discharging the workers and the NLRB did not have the authority to force the company to rehire the strikers. While it is not explicitly stated that sit-down strikes are illegal, the court's decision and wording implies that sit-down striking has been effectively subdued within New England."

The New Englander philanthropist and businessman Stephen Carlton Clark is a great fan of the sport and aims to honour those who have shown excellence worthy of memorial. A native of Coopersville in New York, Clark was pained to see the city struggle throughout the Great Depression and sought to increase the town's revenues by upgrading its cultural institutions.

Churches, barns, railroad cars, museums, and even log cabins became recreational centres where GIs could rest and socialise. These establishments provided service members with a place to relax, have a dance, view films, and of course, a hungry GI could not deny the free coffee and doughnuts. The USO has been known for bringing concerts and events close to the frontlines to provide battle-weary troops with hope and encouragement in the desperate war to reunite the nation. Famous Hollywood refugees like Bette Davis and Spencer Tracey have joined the growing cast of current stars in the media to help the war effort by performing for the soldiers in the trenches. The USO has also seen a more significant influx of women volunteers - to provide a nostalgic hour for the weary soldier so he can talk and meet with the girl from back home in person. For many of these men, the girls they meet at USO events remind them of whom they are fighting for - bringing back to mind their loved ones and their sisters and friends they left behind to fight for American freedom."

At the encouragement of a scientist, Rodgers takes a super-serum in an experiment that dramatically enhances his physical abilities and size, transforming him into a near-perfect rendition of the human form. As "Captain America," Rodgers and his sidekick Bucky Barnes fight enemies of America such as the Syndicalists' Red Skull as well as the demagogues of Mac Arthur and Huey Long, who have been portrayed in the comics as warmongers intent on destroying all aspects of American life. While some have complained that Simon's character has been overly political, Simon himself has admitted that his character was a consciously political creation and that he and Kirby found themselves repulsed at the actions of the Silvershirts and the Red Guards. Captain America has found fans with many young Americans with nearly a million copies in circulation, reminding them that New England's government stands for the true America.

Carrying 500 passengers from Hoboken, New Jersey, the train left Binghamton, New York, 30 minutes behind schedule while the freight train was traveling from Elmira to Mount Morris. The freight train had backed into a siding to allow the passenger train to pass, but then it moved back onto the mainline while switching cars. The freight train had ignored a stop signal and had moved onto the track of the passenger train. At 17:22 p.m, the passenger train sideswiped the freight train's engine and derailed with the locomotive of the freight train scraping the sides of several cars. The resulting impact tore open the side of the car, and boiler steam from the freight engine filled into the coach.\n\nMany people found themselves frantically trapped in the coach, and some could escape by breaking windows. All but one of the 29 fatalities were caused by internal or external scalding of the boiler steam. Thanks to the rapid response by a local sheriff, first responders were able to deploy rapidly to the scene, including firemen and the medical services. Many of the passengers on the train were army servicemen, and thus they formed a little police unit to keep spectators and onlookers away until sufficient policemen had arrived. Around 114 people were injured, with nearly 56 requiring hospitalisation.

It was intended to be literally thrown like a baseball, and it could be held with two fingers on its weighted \"butterfly cap.\" Once in the air, the cap would detach from the grenade, and a nylon string would unwind until a secondary arming pin attached is pulled - allowing the grenade to detonate upon impact.

With the height of the Great Depression hitting the states in 1930, Carlson found himself out of work and out of money.\n\nIn 1936, Carlson began to study law at the New York Law School in Tribeca amidst the chaos that engulfed the American nation. Spending long nights at the New York Public Library, he grew tired of copying law books by hand due to his inability to afford them. This seemingly endless task led him to read an article in an obscure German scientific journal from Pál Selényi regarding the nature of copying machines. He conducted experiments after experiments in his tiny apartment - often smoky and smelly and sometimes even explosive. Despite developing arthritis of the spine, Carlson persisted - working with an Austrian immigrant, Otto Kornei. Finally, on October 22, 1938, the men achieved their breakthrough Kornei wrote: \"10-.22.-38 ASTORIA\" in ink on a slide which then had an electrical current generated and then transferred onto wax paper. In the hands of the two men was the world's first xerographic copy. While Carlson has already filed for a patent, it remains unknown whether or not businesses will approach Carlson for his invention. The Army Signal Corps has already expressed great interest in dry copies produced alternatively than the traditional photographic techniques."

 newengland.29.d:0 "The tiny hamlet of Town Line in Erie County, New York, has long claimed to have seceded from the United States. With the great conflict upon New England, on a ceremonious occasion, Town Line has officially declared their re-entry into New England in the sense of unity and commonwealth - to declare their support to the New Englander war effort.\n\nThe tale of secession takes place during the first American civil war. In 1861, the men of the hamlet gathered at an informal meeting at a schoolhouse and passed an 85-40 resolution to secede from the United States. While the reasons for the vote are unknown, some have pointed out that Town Line's residents were motivated due to their willingness to avoid the military draft. Nonetheless, because Town Line was never an incorporated municipal entity and had no well-defined borders, the Confederacy and the Union did not recognize secession. Now, the residents have decided to ceremoniously vote once more, and this time, with 90 votes to 23, Town Line has rescinded their 1861 secession."

 newengland.30.d:0 "A new book may soon be in the hands of New Englander school children, although its publication has been indeed troubled. Rejected by nearly 20 publishers, \"And to think that I saw on Mulberry Street\" was finally published at Vanguard Press. The book is a rhythmic children's story featuring a child's fanciful imagination while strolling through Mulberry Street (perhaps inspired by the actual Mulberry Street in Springfield, Massachusetts) while colourful and expressive illustrations dot each page.\n\nWriting under the moniker \"Dr. Seuss\", the author is Theodore Geisel, a 33-year-old New Englander of German descent with nearly ten years of writing and illustrating experience. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, where he rose to the editor-in-chief of the humour magazine \"Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern.\" Geisel continued his education by attending Oxford University in the Union of Britain to achieve his Ph.D. in English literature, where he met his future wife, Helen Palmer. Leaving Oxford in 1927 without finishing his degree, Geisel began to submit drawings and illustrations to make a living - achieving breakthrough success with a commercial piece for Filt, a bug spray. In 1936, after returning from a European voyage, Geisel felt inspired by the rhythmic sounds of the ship's engines which encouraged him to develop the rhyme scheme that makes up his latest book.\n\nFleeing New York City, as one of many American refugees - Geisel has returned home to his native New England in the hopes of escaping the tragic plight shared by many in the former United States. According to Geisel, the frustration of being consistently rejected led him to nearly burn his manuscript of Mulberry Street until he ran into an old Dartmouth classmate. The chance encounter gave way to its eventual publication at the hands of Vanguard Press, and although sales are modest, the reviews have been quite favorable."

 newengland.31.d:0 "Amidst the civil war tensions, the New England film company has been busy at work with none other than a hit at the box office with \"Captain Courageous.\" Filmed and set in New England, the film is based on the Rudyard Kipling 1897 novel, an emotional story of maritime camaraderie among the treacherous New England waters.\n\nThe film's protagonist Harvey Cheyne (played by child actor Freddie Bartholomew), is the spoiled son of an American business tycoon. Shunned by his classmates and suspended at boarding school, Harvey is sent on a European excursion with his father to fall overboard in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. He is then fatefully rescued by a Portuguese-American sailor, Manuel Fidello (played by the handsome Spencer Tracy), and taken aboard a Massachusetts schooner. Onboard the "We're Here," Harvey finds that his status as the son of a wealthy New York socialite means nothing, and despite his spoiled acts, the boy is still offered a temporary crew ship until the boat returns to the States. He befriends the captain's son Dan (played by Mickey Rooney), and he grows closer to Manuel, with Manuel becoming an almost surrogate father for the young boy. In the movie's climax, the schooner races against a rival vessel when Manuel climbs to the top of the ship's mast. The mast cracks, and Manuel is plunged into the icy sea, much to the horror and sadness of Harvey. Returning to the States, Harvey is reunited with his father, who is in awe of his son's growth in maturity over the past months. They offer a solemn moment of remembrance at the Fisherman's Memorial in Gloucester, Massachusetts, with bouquets and wreaths - the closing shot being the memorial and a smiling Manuel.\n\nCritics have praised the movie for acknowledging the naturally formed bonds made at sea and the tribulations the waves have to offer. For many, it is indeed a reflection of the times with New England's position in the great American Civil War and a reminder of the natural New Englander spirit to continue on despite the hardships."

Born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in Lowell, Massachusetts, "Betty" (a name she has had since her youth) began her acting career in the theatres of Broadway and then the screens of Hollywood. Described as beautiful and bubbling with charm, Davis' film career began to rise with breakthrough roles in films such as "The Man who Played God" and "Of Human Bondage." Fleeing the nation as one of many American refugees with the outbreak of the civil war, Davis returned home to New England where she helped play a role in the growing New England film industry. Her forthright manner, idiosyncratic speech, and always present cigarette has contributed to a greater public persona.\n\nIn particular, Davis has achieved a main role in the 1939 New England box office success "Dark Victory." One of the highest grossing films of the year, her role in the movie paved the way for stardom. With the outbreak of war, Davis has also achieved frontline popularity especially among servicemen with her natural charisma and beauty - selling nearly 2 million in war bonds within two days as well as a picture of herself for 250,000. Willing to perform for black serviceman, Davis pushed for a sort of "Hollywood Canteen" for the soldiers where famous actors and actresses can entertain the tired troops. While in her film career, she has preferred to play antagonistic or villainous roles; she has been placed in more feminine roles as a result of the war - as a way to distract the female audiences from the reality of their lives."

 newengland.33.d:0 "Since May of 1936, the AFL has been helping a union in the towns of Tonawanda, Ilion, and Syracuse strike against the Remington Rand company. Inspired by the syndicalist strikes across the rust belts, the workers reached the pinnacle of their anger when the company began spreading rumors that they would be bought by a firm that would not recognize the union. After the union threatened a strike, the company distributed its own strike ballots, which led to anger as union members seized and destroyed company ballots while also intimidating managers.\n\nSpurred on by the radical rhetoric of Jack Reed and his SPA, the union members became increasingly violent as the protests escalated. Local police and private security forces were called up by Remington Rand on numerous occasions to break up the strikers. As the frustration of the strikers grew, so did their tactics. Emboldened by Red Guard militias, strikers had begun to create homemade bombs and hurl large iron balls at the police. Blood has been shed, as some of the strikers have even been shot by the police.\n\nWith no compromise in view, an obvious choice would be to send in the National Guard. Putting down the strikers and regaining the police force's discipline would ensure that this rabble would finally be dealt with. However, some stress that this may only fuel more tensions among our workers. The Syndicalists are right on our border, and they will no doubt capitalize on this strike to further paralyse our nation. Instead, they suggest that we approach the strikers in negotiation - this will also help us earn the trust of the striking workers."

The protestors who had been growing more daring in the past weeks of striking began to hurl not just insults but projectiles at the National Guardsmen. Nobody knows who fired the first shot, but the strikers and Guardsmen were drawn into a chaotic swirl of violence and rage, leading to scores being injured.\n\nReinforcements of National Guardsmen had arrived in Tonawanda, Ilion, and Syracuse at the request of the state governor. Severely outnumbered, the strikers began to disperse, but the guardsmen began arresting strikers en masse, placing strike leaders in chains. The response from the National Guard was surprisingly effective. Faced with the strength of the military, the strikers agreed to end their strike, but serious concerns have been raised towards President [NEE.GetLeader]. The strikers will undoubtedly use this act as an excuse to garner support from the Syndicalist elements in Chicago. The governor has faced criticism from the press and the state of New York for the repression, with many claiming the use of the national guard was a precursor to tyranny."

The strikers were appeased, and their rights to unionize were officially granted by Rand. Many of the strikers who had been arrested during the strikes were rehired.\n\nWhile many nationwide are hailing this as a success among the working classes, the strike's victory has worried some. If workers continue to be radicalized and organise deadly strikes that cripple the already exhausted economy, who knows how long before New England falls to the syndicalist menace. While the factories are reopening and the strikers finally return to work, many in the government wonder if New England will be safe from the tide of revolution."

Shortly after the strikes began, the manufacturers offered a 10% wage increase to fulfill the strikers' demand - but these offers were quickly put down.\n\nWith the protests growing increasingly violent and with no signs of the strikers backing down, President [NEE.GetLeader] has requested that the governor of Maine deal with the situation at hand. The governor can call in the National Guard, which may involve further altercation and outright violence, although the protests will definitely be quieted. Alternatively, the governor can negotiate with the strikers although this would be a serious loss of face for the New England government to handle its own people."

The Lewiston Evening Journal described the event as simply "Red Wednesday" due to the violence of the incident. Strike organisers such as Powers Hapgood were immediately arrested and sentenced to short-terms, and for nights, the guardsmen patrolled Lewiston and Auburn. While the President congratulated the governor for his initiative in subduing the unrest, the civil unrest, especially among Maine's French-Canadian population, has only grown in response to the harsh crackdown."

Finally the strikers agreed to be supervised by company unions at the cost of having the rest of their demands fulfilled. The Lewiston Evening Journal summed the negotiations up as a much needed relief in these uncertain times.\n\nNonetheless, the governor's negotiation with the strikers has led to doubts as to whether or not he is capable of leading the state of Maine. Many in the nation do see syndicalism as an ever present threat and surely pleasing the workers would only encourage their radical ideas to spread further. Criticism from Democrats in Maine have been aimed at the governor's seemingly soft stance claiming it as a \"surrender to syndicalism.\""

The bridge's construction rate was incredibly fast and ten weeks ahead of schedule, taking only sixteen months for completion - a fantastic feat and testament to the cooperation between the nations. The design of the spans fit the regional topography producing beautiful bridges with artistic grace and attention to detail, with the colors chosen to match the surrounding environment. Following the president's dedication, the first civilian and military vehicles began across the bridge - the first of many as the bridge serves its intended purpose as an indestructible physical bond between the Canadian and American people."

As the national crisis continues to escalate, many are undoubtedly thankful for Canada's protection and aid, but many are also wary of Canada's growing presence in American affairs. The Provisional Government of New England exists only because of Canada's intervention, and thus it will take time and effort to legitimise the government of New England as the true successor to the United States. Isolationists or not, no one in New England wishes to witness the return of the British in Boston, and while the Canadians have assured New Englanders that they are safe, only time will tell whether or not the occupation is temporary."

 newengland.69.d:0 "An instant hit at the box office and mentioned by critics throughout the country, many claims that \"Dark Victory\" will be in the running for an Academy Award - with multiple articles praising actress Bette Davis' performance and claiming her performance is award-worthy. The film is a telling and dramatic piece of New England's upper society and has come when societal tensions are at an all-time high. In particular, the film's themes of mortality and all-star cast have proven to be reasons for the movie's success at the cinema.\n\nSet in New York City, Judith \"Judy\" Traherne (played by Bette Davis) is a young and carefree hedonistic Long Island socialite and heiress with a passion for all things expensive and vices such as smoking and drinking. Despite her outgoing lifestyle, she begins to experience headaches and blurred vision, and after multiple incidents, she visits a doctor at her friend Anne King's recommendation. She meets Dr. Frederick Steele (played by Irishman George Brent) who is reluctant to aid the antagonistic Judy, but upon a further inspection, Steele realizes that Judy is even beginning to experience short-term memory loss. In a surgical operation, Steele realizes that Judy has a malignant glioma brain tumor that cannot be removed and that Judy will die within a year but not before she experiences total blindness. To give her false hope, Steele lies to Judy and Anne to allow her to live with happiness. Although Anne discovers the truth, she agrees to keep it a secret. As time passes, Steele and Judy become romantically involved, but eventually, Judy finds out Steele's diagnosis by accident. The two experience a short break in which Judy reverts to her old habits. After a conversation with her stablemaster, Judy decides that she will go out with dignity and returns to Steele, where the two move to Vermont. The film concludes with an ending that leaves audiences in tears as Steele heads off to present a potential cure for Judy's cancer while Judy finally becomes fully blind. The final dialogue between Steele and Judy has been praised by the people of New England for its reassuring tone in the time of national crisis. Calm and composed at the end, in contrast to her actions in the earlier parts of the film, Judy lies motionless on her bed as the screen fades to black."

 newengland.77.d:0 "As the Provisional Government of New England finds itself on the doorstep of war, the question has been raised by businesses and the army as to which company the government will align itself with. To reclaim the rest of the nation means that New England infantrymen will have to be equipped with the most modern rifles - the old dusty national guard rifles hastily handed out will not do. Two names for an officially sponsored government contract have been consistent throughout the endless debates - the Springfield Armory and the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.\n\nScouted and approved by George Washington himself in 1777, the Springfield Armory is an obvious candidate. Briefly, the only government manufacturer of arms during the first American Civil War, choosing the Springfield Armory carries a symbolic resonance, especially as New England claims itself to be the last bastion of American democracy on the continent. An industrial powerhouse responsible for mass producing and developing the M1903 rifle, the Springfield Armory also features a curious new weapon designed by New Englander John Garand. Garand has been developing a semi-automatic rifle since 1919, and although many of his designs have failed to meet the army's specifications, his latest design, the \"M1, caliber 30,\" has shown to be extremely promising in initial tests. With the M1 in plans to be fully adopted within our armed forces, perhaps we should consider supporting the Springfield Armory.\n\nThe Winchester Repeating Arms Company has also been brought up in discussion. Founded in 1866, the company is responsible for the successful \"Model 1873\" known as the \"Gun that Won the West,\" named as such for its iconic use on the Great Plains. Since its early days, the Winchester Company has continuously released self-loading rifles in the many years of its operation. While the Great Depression had severely weakened the company, company vice president John M. Olin pushed a new company tradition of producing only the finest and well-crafted deluxe rifles and shotguns. Since its hard times, the company has bounced back, and their craftsmanship would surely come in handy for our uses. If Winchester secures the government contract, our soldiers will have their hands on sturdy and durable rifles."

 newengland.104.d:0 "When the great civil war broke out, the government of New England found itself divided regarding participation in the war. With the popularity of isolationist groups such as America First, many New Englanders hoped to wait out the war that threatened to consume the New World. As the Great Depression persisted, the economy of New England struggled immensely, and it was not until the Second Square Deal under President [NEE.GetLeaderName] that the economy of New England began to show signs of recovery and growth.\n\nWith its economy on the road to total recovery, the factories once producing shoes and cars are now producing military trucks and uniforms as the threat of war grows nearer every day. Many in New England have begun to see the conflict for what it truly is - a battle for the true America, and New England cannot sit away from the war idly. The time has come to reclaim the country from those who drove it into chaos. Air raid drills are being practiced daily across the schools in New England, and young men and women flock to recruitment centres - eager to serve their country in its hour of need. The odds are heavily stacked against New England - most of the other factions have far more enormous manpower reserves and industries. Nonetheless, history has always favored the bold, and the industrial might of the American Northeast should not be underestimated. Our factories on the ground will churn out more and more while our planes above will ensure our skies remain free and safe. Like our ancestors in 1776, we will not be intimidated by the odds as the tree of liberty will not fall to the reactionaries and revolutionaries that seek to defile it!"

Perhaps in a desperate bid to muster men for the hopeful return of the British Exiles, the Canadian government's enactment of full conscription infuriated the Quebecois leading to mass protests and riots across the country.

 newengland.150.d:0 "Located at 17 Piedmont Street in the Bay Village neighbourhood of Boston, a few blocks south of the Boston Public Garden, the Coconut Grove is well known among Bostonians as a popular hangout spot given the number of celebrities that frequent it. Visited by GIs, movie stars, celebrities, and even politicians such as Maurice Tobin - the nightclub also has been rumored to have links with the Mafia and organised crime. Initially a garage and a warehouse, the club offered its patrons dining and dancing in a \"South Seas\" like a tropical paradise with support columns made to look like palm trees and fixtures made to look like coconuts.\n\nAt 10:15 pm on the evening of November 28th however, a young soldier removed a lightbulb in the lounge to give himself and his date some privacy. A young busboy was called to replace the lightbulb, unable to find the bulb he lit a match, tightened the bulb, and extinguished the match. Witnesses would report that soon after, flames burst from palm fronds beneath the ceiling. Despite the best efforts of the staff, the flames simply spread throughout the nightclub, racing faster than patrons could move and covering the entire establishment with smoke. The building's main entrance was a single revolting door which became useless as the patrons stampeded in panic. By the time firefighters had arrived, 492 lives were lost. Perhaps more grotesque was the fact that some bodies were discovered with drinks still in their hands as the fire and toxic smoke had overtaken them too quickly.\n\nThe owner of the club Barney Welansky was convicted on nineteen counts of manslaughter due to his failure in following the loose restrictions of the city. Investigators also discovered that the club lacked licenses for serving liquor and food and the remodeling was done by unlicensed contractors. The mayor of Boston, Maurice Tobin has come under fire for his connections to Welansky with some calling for his resignation."

New Hampshire's jurisdiction begins with the original low water line on the west bank of the river. For nearly 150 years, the two states had been arguing where the line ran. Both states collected taxes from property owners, and there was a recurrent debate between the states as to which state would control the bridges and control powerhouses.\n\nA.F. Hassen, chief of the cartographic section of the Geological Survey, said that some map changes in the past twenty years have been significant enough to change in the geographic text but obscure enough to mostly only affect scientists, road builders, and engineers. Most of these changes happened as a result of rivers changing course. Following the fixture of the Vermont-New Hampshire border, the Geological Survey began to look for other erratic rivers that may have changed course and, therefore, could drastically change the boundary lines."

The bespectacled and short visitor greeted Grew with a bow, and to the surprise of onlookers, Grew returned the favor. Grew then invited the guest and his entourage into his home, where it is reported that the men shared a delicious drink of tea.\n\nThe visitor is Prince Tokugawa Iesato, the first head of the Tokugawa Clan after the overthrow of the Tokugawa Bakufu and the ensuing Meiji Restoration. A youth in England gave Iesato the respect of the Entente Powers - during the Weltkrieg, Iesato had organised a condolence booklet in concern for the enormous death and destruction in Europe. Despite the tense relations between Japan and the United States, Iesato and Grew had come to treat each other as close friends and sought to encourage goodwill between the two nations. In recognition of Japan's gift of cherry blossom trees in 1912, Iesato had travelled to New England in a goodwill event despite the great civil war that now divides the United States.\n\nWhile their conversation was limited to only those who were present, there are rumors that the two men discussed the ongoing situation in the Pacific. For a long time, the United States had competed with Japan for domination of the great ocean. Now with the civil war plaguing the United States, the Japanese stand virtually unopposed in the Pacific. Even if Iesato himself is committed to peace, the Japanese nation certainly has ambitions in Asia - ambitions that it will now feel comfortable to pursue without the industrial giant of America present. While no open conflict has yet emerged between the two countries, only time will tell whether or not peace will reign in Asia."

 newengland.153.d:0 "It is revealed to the public that administration leaders in the New England Congress received a surprise when a new possible war referendum was brought to the debate. The bill proposes that a national referendum should be held before Congress can declare war, thus giving the ordinary men and women the chance to have a direct vote on their country's involvement in foreign conflicts. However, in the case where the nation is attacked first, a referendum would not be held.\n\nThe controversial bill has secured the 23 votes needed to bring the bill into the House. Many Irish-American delegates are eager to support the bill, believing that this will give New England the ability to stay away from aiding the former British Empire. These delegates and the people they represent are wary of the British, with the memories of the Great Famine and the War for Independence still fresh in their minds. Nonetheless, with the decision of 35 congress members in the balance, congressman James Farley rallied his fellow Irish-American congressmen to shut down the bill. Farley believes that America's place in the world is to help it and not to stay away from the world's affairs. His efforts have been successful; the possible war referendum act has been shut down.\n\nInterestingly enough, a parliamentary question was raised late tonight by the discovery that the list of signers bore the name of William P. Connery Jr, a representative from Massachusetts who had died by the time the petition was being presented. The rule requires that a discharge petition be signed by a majority of the membership of the House.

Lyons of the Boston Globe. In the ensuing speech, former Ambassador Kennedy unambiguously and repeatedly stated his belief that the war to liberate the Home Isles was not about saving democracy from the tide of Syndicalism.\n\n\"It's all a question of what we do for the next six months. The whole reason for aiding Canada is to give us time...as long as she is in there, we have time to prepare. It isn't that she's fighting for democracy. That's the bunk. She's fighting to restore the monarchy over the subjects who rejected her. I know more about the European situation than anybody else, and it's up to me to see that the country gets it.\"\n\nMr. Kennedy's words attracted nothing more than outrage from the President of New England and the Canadian government. The President has replaced Kennedy with John Winant, the former governor of New Hampshire. In his first official statement as the new ambassador to the Dominion of Canada, Winant has declared that \"We the people of New England are determined to help by action to ensure total victory over socialist aggression.\" Perhaps signalling a period of increased American and Canadian ties, Winant stressed that between the Canadians and Americans exist \"a bond of common sympathy and understanding, common purpose and devotion which will live on long after Syndicalist tyranny.\""

In the days following Hopkins' implementation of Work Progress Administration relief programs, Hopkins has come under fire within elements in Congress, with some denouncing him as a syndicalist disguised in sheep's clothing.\n\nIn a speech to the House, Democratic representative John J. Connor from New York State declared that the \"head of one of our great departments is a registered socialist.\" When Connor was asked whether or not he referred to Hopkins, Connor shrugged his shoulders and replied that \"one must draw their conclusions.\" While Hopkins and his son have reiterated orally that Hopkins does not belong to the Socialist Party, this particular incident has illustrated the paranoia among congress members regarding the so-called \"Red Menace\". Those who are fiscally conservative are wary of the increasing role of the government in the economy and have come to see socialism as the nation's greatest enemy, both politically and morally. Even in the workplace, there are reports that those suspected of having leftist leaning beliefs or those speaking favorably of Reed's movement in Chicago are being fired and discredited.

The program now sets the new wage at $3.90 a month to more than 82,000 workers.\n\nIn the rural areas of New England, Hopkins argues that the wage earners there are only 45 per cent of the national average but with this new increase they will be getting 53 per cent of that average. This gives the impression of comparative underpayment in the North on the WPA. Nonetheless, opposing congressmen who are opposed to government intervention in the economy, find Hopkins' legislation too radical. Critics find themselves uncertain as to whether or not Hopkins' wage increase will actually benefit the rural farmer, especially since WPA wages can be determined by a single person. To quell doubt among the working class and politicians, Hopkins has helped organise the Community Mobilisation for Human Needs - an organisation dedicated to sharing the costs of relief between local, state, and federal governments."

The program was later expanded to include an unemployment insurance system and a national healthcare program - assisting those hit hardest by the economic problems of the late 30s. Nonetheless, with the Great Depression a distant memory, Congress' rollback of some of the provisions of Social Security has attracted controversy among some citizens who still find themselves reliant on the system. According to Snell, the Amendment is designed to prevent \"wasteful and disruptive discord between employer, employee, and labour organisations.\" Snell believes that the revision will help limit government competition with private enterprises so that businesses might create jobs with some certainty as to the future.

Holding the belief that traits are hereditary, Babson hopes to emulate the lives of his ancestors in his words and actions. After studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in engineering and a brief stint working on Massachusetts highway projects, Babson turned to a career of work as an investment banker. From there, his career expanded into economics advising, a brilliant financial forecaster keen on helping young and upcoming investors - Babson earned the distinction of being the first financial forecaster to predict the German economic collapse on Black Monday.\n\nSurviving what seemed to be an inescapable diagnosis of tuberculosis, Babson credits his recovery to his unshakeable faith. According to the Secretary of Commerce himself, Babson's most profound experience was his religious conversion at fifteen. From 1936 to 1938, Babson served as National Church Moderator for the General Council on the Congregational Christian Churches. During his tenure, he employed his fondness for statistics to showcase the church's weakness in attendance - fearing that a decline in church attendance would lead to a decay in society's morals. His appeals to chart a morally correct course for church and society were met with threats and defiance - ultimately ending his tenure as a moderator in disappointment.\n\nNevertheless, Babson refuses to give up. Now, as Secretary of Commerce, he has charted the course to open church doors for every day and hour. Babson's churches will be opened to peoples of all faiths so that all will have the space to express praise and worship to their most high. The opening of the first such establishment in Wellesley, MA, will be the first of many national churches for all Americans to practice their religions freely."

The party has also expressed its desire to pass legislation to conserve natural resources, reduce debt and taxation, aid farmers, and assure workers and consumers of industry's products and profits. As the new Secretary of Commerce, Babson has used his platform to denounce America's "decaying moral order" and petition the American people to return to the churches.\n\nWhile the total prohibition on the vices may not be a reality any time soon, Babson's party has undoubtedly achieved a victory with new legislation promising to help small rural farmers. These farmers will receive government stimulus and will have their taxation reduced to help them prosper. Babson himself has acknowledged that his party's size prevents it from becoming as relevant as the Democrats and the Republicans, but he has declared that he hopes that the people of America will take notice of his movement."

Ever since the first American Civil War, tariffs in the United States have been at an all-time high. In response to the decades-long Great Depression and Black Monday, tariffs in the United States and the nation embraced a trade policy of protectionism. The Reciprocal Tariff Act aims to bring down these barriers, bring down duties on foreign products, and encourage trade between nations.\n\nBefore establishing the Reciprocal Tariff Act, if Congress wanted to enact a lower tariff - it would be unliterary and tackle the foreign country's tariff rate as fixed. Congress would choose a tariff rate that was either a little lower or higher than the median preferred tariff, depending on the composition of Congress. Individual members of Congress were under tremendous pressure from lobbyists to raise tariffs to protect them from the adverse effects of imports. The Reciprocal Tariff Act now ties US tariff reductions to foreign tariff reductions, giving Congress the ability to approve the tariffs with a simple majority instead of a two-thirds majority.

The group's divisive members allow it to be non-partisan, with the men striving for pragmatic American internationalism and an aversion to ideological fervor. The men tend to be practical, realistic, and non ideological - hoping to bring America back onto the world stage after the destructive civil war. With their expertise in diplomacy, it has been reported that the President values the group's advice, especially in containing syndicalism from corrupting the rest of the free nations of the world.

Steinhardt had been unfortunately killed in an early morning plane accident near Ramsayville, Ontario. In addition to Steinhardt, the plane accident also took the lives of several American servicemen and Alan Harrington, a twenty-year old son of a United States minister who had been visiting his parents in Canada. The plane was a C-47 used by the ambassador for business flights and en route to New York, no foul play has been suspected so far. Witnesses saw the plane emitting heavy smoke shortly after leaving the Rockcliffe Airport before falling and exploding into flames. Only one American serviceman escaped by parachute, it remains uncertain whether or not the parachutes had either malfunctioned or that the men were hesitant to jump. Regardless, the incident is being investigated by the Royal Canadian Air Force and a United States investigation team sent from [NEE.GetCapital].\n\nBorn on October 6, 1892- Steinhardt grew up in New York City and served a brief stint in the army in the 60th Field Artillery. A member of the Republican Party, he ascended into politics with a close friendship with President Baldwin. Entering the world of international relations, Steinhardt served as the American Ambassador to Sweden where he was given the Order of the Polar Star by King Gustav V in 1936. The civil war in America forced Steinhardt to return home and he decided to offer his allegiance to the Provisional Government in New England.

To this end, the political trends in Maine are a good measure of the national mood, with its September gubernatorial election widely considered a predictor of the following national elections. In recent years, however, a new wave of immigration from French Canada to the mill-towns of central Maine has disrupted the homogeneity and tranquility of the state. With a growing community of devout Catholics in the state, the entrenched protestant majority increasingly turned to charismatic magician turned Ku Klux Klan Leader F. Eugene Farnsworth, who developed a deep web of Klan patronage and community which threatened to subsume the ruling Republican Party.\n\nThese tensions would come to a head in 1926, when a clique of pro-Klan Republicans led by Governor Owen Brewster were soundly defeated by the old guard of the party, which joined forces with their Democratic enemies to secure the election of an anti-Klan senator. In the wake of this electoral defeat, the Maine Klan suffered a number of legal and monetary setbacks, leading to a near universal collapse. While the Klan itself has all but dissolved, a more insidious legacy remains. A number of sheriffs and municipal administrators across the state were put in place by the Klan more than a decade ago, and continue to maintain Klan values in much of the state.\n\nAs far as official membership goes, on the other hand, all that remains are the Women of the Klan, who continue to fund a collection of local chapters through bake sales and church meetings."

She was joined by Roman Catholic social justice advocate Francis J. Haas (dean of the School of Social Science of the Catholic University of America), a proponent of an occupational labour group system somewhat along the lines of that established by American railroads - management and workers as the machinery for a sound social order. In a panel discussion held at the Catholic Committee of the South in Richmond, Virginia - the two discussed labour, family life, and industry in the postwar South.\n\nPerkins in particular has called for a rebuilding of the labour standards as she deems the pre civil-war labour standards to be \"inadequate.\" She declared that it was necessary that in every nation \"no matter how much we should be pressed by the day to day problems of survival, we shall dedicate a portion of our resources to continuous study and planning of this post-war period.\" Furthermore, she noted that in addition to revising labour standards, there must be a great extension of public \"responsibility\" in the postwar era of public responsibility in health, nutrition, and housing."

On a ski trip in Stowe, Vermont, Dole fractured his ankle, and he had no one to save him but his friend Frank Edson who just happened to pass by. Two months later, Edson went on his own ski race and fractured his ribs and arms while also suffering from lung collapse. The severe injury led to Edson's unfortunate death - and would have a lasting impression on Dole.\n\nThe president of the National Ski Association, Roger Langley, asked Dole to chair a ski accident study for the NSA and set up patrols for the 1938 National Downhill and Slalom Races. The success of this little project convinced Langley to ask Dole to charter a provisional patrol on a national basis throughout the United States. Dole took heavy inspiration from the Parsenndienst, a Swiss patrol in Davos, Switzerland, forming his own ski patrol. However, unlike the Swiss patrol, members of the American patrol did not charge for rescue or care. His \"National Ski Patrol\" is centreed around the motto \"Service and Safety,\" with patrollers mandated to take extensive courses to fulfill Dole's requirements and standards for effective and efficient patrollers. Since the organisation is entirely voluntary, Dole created an awards program based on local and national levels.

Despite a quick colonial war at the turn of the century with the fading power of the Spanish Empire, the United States began a shift in foreign policy towards isolation. While this trend successfully kept our young men from dying needlessly in the fields of Flanders over a European scuffle, American global interests were devastated. The collapse of the Third French Republic was to be a quick showcase of the tremors that were to come in the next half decade. Five years later, when the British Empire collapsed and the stock exchange plummeted, America found itself in its darkest hour since the outbreak of hostilities in 1861. As the Germans pushed the Americans out of the greater European market, and with longstanding American allies falling to socialist revolts, the United States was forced to turn inwards in hopes of outlasting the storm. This isolationist stance saw a decreasing American presence abroad until finally the fires of the second American civil war consumed America once more.\n\nIn a speech given to the New York Times, Secretary of State Sumner Wells decried that \"Isolation, in its earlier form, as an issue, is I believe, dead.\" If America wishes to see prosperity in the world, they can not make it happen while staying inside their borders at home. America must take an active approach to seek out allies and expand their presence. The way to secure future peace is through action, not merely words.

Despite being utterly ruined, Washington D.C. is a powerful candidate.

At the committee, many members of the MPA, such as John Wayne, have argued that radicals in the film industry have been inserting propaganda onto the silver screen to incite labour union violence, manipulate voting behavior, and raise money for Syndicalists worldwide. The committee believed that enough evidence existed and expressed concern about \"everyone in the movie industry who might be used as agents of a foreign power to destroy our country.\" Popular actor Ronald Reagan, president of the Screen Actors Guild, testified that a small clique within his union was using "syndicalist" like tactics to steer union policy.\n\nAs subpoenas have begun to fill the mailboxes of movie writers, directors, actors, and executives - the fear of censorship has strengthened the liberal front in Hollywood. In response, a group of anti-syndicalist liberals formed the Committee of the First Amendment, arguing that the investigations violated the Bill of Rights. The Committee of the First Amendment argued that the American film industry - through its patriotic political mobilisation - had defended democratic America in the media during the civil war.

Many companies had quoted prices of nearly 2,000 dollars per mile to build the needed power lines.\n\nThe Rural Electrification Act of [GetYear] seeks to remedy this issue. Loans are to be made available for large-scale projects such as new power plants or power lines and individual homes.

 newengland.217.d:0 "As the Industrial Revolution arrived in the United States, factory owners would hire young workers for various tasks. Especially in the textile mills that categorize much of New England, finding children in the factories has not been uncommon. Children tend to work in factories and mines as their small statures make it easy to handle machinery and navigate tight spaces. Since 1870, the number of children in the workforce increased, and now with New England attempting to rebuild its industry - that number has not stopped growing.\n\nNonetheless, the implementation of children in the workforce has attracted a substantial degree of controversy. Factory work is dangerous, and children find themselves exposed to the chemicals and machinery of the industrial workplace that often leads to horrible accidents or death. Activist groups such as the National Child Labor Committee (formed in 1904) have risen up in response to child labour, often publicizing young people's lives and working conditions. The Syndicalist cause has also seen efforts to reduce the number of children in the workforce and instead create state compulsory education laws to keep children in schools rather than at work. With New England's industry beginning to recover, Congress has now brought the issue of child labour to its latest debate. While some argue that children are needed to help struggling families and help New England's industry compete with the rest of the American continent, many believe that the practice of child labour is inhumane. Instead, they have pushed Congress to provide compulsory universal education laws nationwide, following the age-old New England tradition of education. Doing so would significantly enhance our research and intellectual capacity as we create a new generation of scientists and researchers, although this would cost fewer hands in the factories."

While Congress is indeed wary of the totalitarian and pervasive radical nature of socialism, the latest Congressional debate brings the issue of wage and labour standards to the table.\n\nThis proposed new law aims to amend the labour agitation in the country while also keeping the populace far from the allure of syndicalism. Supported by individuals within the Bureau of Labour Standards and Congresswoman Mary T. Norton, the proposal plans to formally adopt an eight-hour workday, a forty-hour workweek, and a wage for overtime hours. The act declares that workers must be paid a minimum wage and that the overtime wage must be one-and-a-half times what workers would usually be paid. The act also aims to cover younger workers and declares that workers under eighteen are exempt from specific dangerous jobs. Critics of the proposed law argue that it is nothing more than syndicalism in sheep's clothing and that the law dramatically strengthens workers and unions who may use the act as motivation to demand more. On the other hand, proponents of the law are confident that the passage of such protection will guarantee worker loyalty - ensuring that the issue of labour rights is dealt with for the time being."

 newengland.219.d:0 "\"SCANDAL\" bleeds the headline of every newspaper across the country, with reporters furiously surrounding the Walsh residence in the wake of a nationwide election scandal. Having served two terms as President of [NEE.GetNameDef], Walsh has been acclaimed among many as the savior of the Democratic Party following the civil war that tore the nation apart. Despite his roaring successes in successfully combating the Great Depression and ending years of woe for New Englanders, Walsh seeks a third presidential term - unheard of and completely breaking with American tradition. No president in American history has served a third term - with George Washington himself leaving office after two, setting what many consider to be a precedent. Among the critical voices of the opposition are even those within Walsh's party, men like James Farley.\n\nNevertheless, before Walsh's campaign can even take off, it would appear that it is destined for failure. On a particular evening, OSS spies were dispatched to a male brothel after being informed that syndicalist spies were hiding amongst the patrons. The OSS found not just the syndicalist spies but also an immensely embarrassed David Walsh. His reputation is utterly in shambles among not just his party but the entire nation; Walsh will no longer represent the Democratic Party. Instead, the Democrats have decided to replace Walsh with the esteemed Massachusetts politician Joseph P. Kennedy."

Kennedy has been in league with the former mayor of Boston, James Curley. Due to their shared Irish-Catholic heritage, the two men are pretty close and often seen together within the Massachusetts political scene. It would appear that Joseph Kennedy has paid off Curley for political favors - no doubt in efforts to secure Democratic support for Kennedy's presidential run or perhaps to secure a spot in Congress for Kennedy's son, Joseph F. Kennedy. With Joseph P. Kennedy disgraced, the Democratic Party again has another scandal to deal with and no presidential candidate to contest the Republicans. They have hastily nominated Maurice Tobin to win over their voting base, although it appears that for now, the Republicans possess a tremendous advantage in winning the election of 1944."

While there is debate as to whether or not the legislation was actually successful, the Bureau effectively was abandoned in 1872.\n\nWith the conclusion of the Second American Civil War, Congress has decided to re-establish the Bureau, keeping the humanitarian spirit of its predecessor while also hoping to resolve the former's failures. The organisation has been officially renamed the \"Bureau of Refugees, Landless, and Orphaned\" - headed by none other than the native New Englander archbishop of Boston, Richard Cushing. A member of the NAACP and well known throughout Boston for his seemingly endless energy and desire for reform, Cushing has been noted for his extraordinary charisma that ties together Boston's Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant communities. In addition to economic and medical aid to those left stricken by the brutality of the Civil War, the newly Bureau also plans to provide land, education, and opportunity for those who lost everything. Not only will the Bureau help with rebuilding broken communities, but the Bureau will also aid in the large torrents of former refugees who fled to Canada and New England during the war. Many of these refugees lost their homes and possessions in the opening chaotic weeks of the war, and the Bureau hopes to compensate them for their properties. Cushing has announced his plans for repurposing former Longist and Syndicalist buildings to create schools, clinics, and new institutions to help heal the broken nation. By extending a hand of grace and charity to the former rebellious states of the Union, the Bureau hopes that in time the wounds and scars of war will finally heal."

 newengland.273.d:0 "With its main building covering nearly eighty-two acres and over 30 city blocks, the Dodge Chicago Plant was at one time the largest building in the world. Designed by the so-called "architect of Detroit" Albert Kahn and his company, the Dodge Chicago Plant became a hotbed of radicalism during the civil war as it helped churn out weapons, equipment, and vehicles for the CSA war effort. Its innovative design featured an extensive network of tunnels to facilitate foot and supply traffic while also providing shelter from the air raids above.\n\nAfter the war, the factory was moved into government hands and its former labourers employed. These workers had enjoyed extremely liberal conditions and benefits during their so-called revolution. They began to agitate and complain when they saw the former working policies of the CSA repealed and their old managers replaced. What started as an initial protest turned into a deadly strike, frightening the factory owners who had flashbacks of the years before the civil war. They called in local policemen to disperse the strikers, but the strikers only grew in numbers, and soon, the confrontations grew violent, with the strikers seizing tools and crafting homemade weapons to drive out the police. The strikers then barricaded themselves in the giant plant, with the governor of Illinois deciding to use the National Guard to suppress the unrest once and for all. The National Guard had difficulty storming the strikers who used the vast tunnels to hide and harass the guardsmen. As the soldiers breached into the plant, the strikers grew violent making use of their weapons to inflict casualties on the guardsmen. Against the superior firepower and strength of the guardsmen, the strikers found themselves simply outgunned; mass arrests were made of the surviving strike organisers and agitators."

The riot in Chicago had provoked similar outbursts of working-right-related risings, all of which became quickly suppressed. Harsh curfews were enforced on Steel Belt cities, and the region has effectively been placed on martial law, with frequent night patrols roaming the streets in search of disturbances. While the actions of the police and National Guardsmen have attracted controversy among some media outlets, the President has justified the military's intervention in the crisis, arguing that the National Guard only intends to prevent future provocation from radicals and reactionaries alike.

Today, white mobs gathered in cities like Birmingham and Montgomery to protest integration and desegregation, with many proclaiming "Segregation Now, Segregation Tomorrow, Segregation Forever." Large numbers of Klansmen, cloaked in their familiar white robes and hoods, have been seen intimidating black families and churches throughout the South. As the South grows increasingly unsteady, the National Guard has been ordered to protect African-Americans fearful for their lives.

Following the end of the war and the nation's effort at desegregation, black families were encouraged to buy houses in formerly segregated white neighbourhoods. The Klan would make nighttime trips to these houses, firing shots and throwing bombs into black homes and, in some cases, even lighting one's door on fire. Due to the near relentless wave of violence, Center Street in Birmingham has been amusingly named by black residents as "Dynamite Hill," with many black residents remarking the violence is reminiscent of the bombing and shelling of the Civil War. The local police in Birmingham have been noted for being extraordinarily late, and their lack of patrolling has led the violence to go on without repercussions. As a result of the chaos, the National Guard has been sent to Birmingham, with guardsmen stationed throughout black neighbourhoods to deter the violence.

With unrest in major American cities and states, Congress has officially repealed the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878.\n\nSigned by then-President Rutherford B. Hayes, the Act limited the power of the Federal Government in the use of federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. The Act was designed to be passed in response to the Federal army occupation of the South during the twelve years of Reconstruction during the Civil War. In a sweeping form of legislation today, Congress has declared that the continued terrorism and violence of the remnant Syndicalist and Longist resistance movements must be crushed at all costs. The Act has officially been dissolved, giving the Federal Government the ability to use the military, airforce, and navy to enforce its will. With the Army's tanks and trucks on their way to the major cities of resistance like Birmingham and Chicago, civilians have already begun to voice their concerns as the nation descends into complete martial law."

Coal Mining had flourished in West Virginia during the late 1800s, and by 1917, the coal mining industry accounted for nearly 89,348,000 tonnes of coal. A hotbed of Syndicalist radicalism, areas like Mingo County and the Little Coal River became havens of socialist resistance, with miners and partisans stocking up in ammunition and arms.\n\nThe foggy and misty Applachian mountains proved to be a defender's paradise. The miners had access to tunnels and paths that they knew best, striking National Guard units with impact and surprise. Days of sporadic skirmishing and brief encounters led to nothing more than the frustration of the National Guard, although the miners became increasingly outnumbered. Lt. General Thomas J.H. Trapnell and Thomas Francis Hickey planned a coordinated assault involving artillery and air coordination to wipe out the Syndicalist resistance. The Federal Army had intelligence from the air with planes spotting the pockets of resistance in the air, and thus the Federal troops began to shell the Syndicalist resistance to break and weaken the Syndicalist morale. Despite the intense bombardment, the Syndicalists offered considerable resistance, primarily due to their knowledge of the terrain and entrenched positions. Nearly 157 federal troopers would lose their lives in the ensuing operation. However, the Syndicalist efforts would prove futile as their casualties increased and their supplies grew increasingly limited. After a week of intermittent fighting, the last of the miners and partisans began to climb out of their hiding positions, turning in their arms to the federal government."

Led by the West Point graduate Hamilton E. Howze, the army has decided to execute "Operation Eucalyptus," a coordinated strike of highly maneuverable units into the dense and deep Louisiana bayous. A fierce advocate for maneuver warfare and speed, Howze believed that the best way to crush the Longist resistance would be through repeated raids in an attempt to gradually weaken and demoralise the rebel remnants. After a week of enduring resistance, the cracks in the Longist defenses were beginning to show. Isolated from supplies and reinforcements, their forces were being thinned out with each rapid Federal raid. With the help of the New England dockyards, small, fast, and inexpensive patrol torpedo (PT) boats were brought out to help navigate and scout out the swamps. Following a week of continued fighting in the swamps, the last of the Klansman and Longists offered their unconditional surrender - ending the previous significant Union State efforts to oppose the federal government."

Beached on a deserted island were a group of men and a canoe. Without resorting to headquarters and breaching protocol, the crew of U-99's Kapitänleutnant Otto Kretschmer immediately organised a party, including himself, to investigate. Upon reaching the island, they found that the men were American crewmen from a torpedo boat named PT-109 that had been destroyed in an attack by the Japanese. After ensuring the American crew was fed and clothed, Kretschmer immediately radioed his superiors to ensure they were sent home.\n\nThe commander of PT-109 was none other than the handsome son of the acclaimed New England congressman Joseph P. Kennedy. Lt. John F. Kennedy had been ordered to bring PT-109 to scout and survey Japanese naval movements near German Samoa. However, on a dark and moonless night, their ship was caught off guard and rammed suddenly by a Japanese destroyer - cutting the entire vessel in half. With the wreckage of a crew and two dead crew members, Kennedy gave his men the order to fight or surrender. The brave sailors chose to fight to the end and swam 3.5 miles away from the wreckage of their ship to find safety. The brave lieutenant swam through the water despite an injured back, towing a badly burned crewman with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth. Kennedy made other mile-long swims to hail passing PT boats or search for supplies for his exhausted crew. He and his executive officer then made the long swim with their crew to a nearby island where they found edible coconuts but no freshwater. Thus, Kennedy and a crewmate made a one-hour swim to find supplies, where they found a canoe with drinkable water and food. Two days later, paddling back to his crewmates, they were discovered by and were rescued by U-99, much to their relief.\n\nLt. Kennedy has returned home a hero, although he has continued to thank Otto Kretschmer and the crew of U-99 for their hospitality. He has returned home, hailed as a hero, decorated with the Purple Heart and Silver Star Medal. With his natural charisma, many are wondering if he, too, will continue a career in politics like his father."

These desolate shanty towns that sprang up to house those who had become homeless due to the Depression reflected the American nation's lack of social safety. Following the victory of democracy in the Second American Civil War, President [NEE.GetLeader] and an entourage, including General Lemuel Shepherd, have arrived in Seattle to assess the damage done by the great civil war and encourage national unity.\n\nThe Emerald City had become a haven of socialist resistance and sentiment during the early 1900s. One of the largest state affiliates of the Socialist Party of America in the Western States of America, Washington boasted more than 62,000 paid members. When the civil war broke out and the Pacific States of America seceded, socialist demagogues like Anna Louise Strong helped lead the treacherous Seattle Commune in a seditious uprising against the Union. For days, anarchy and chaos plagued the streets as the city became yet another front in the great war. Pacific troops under General Alexander Vandegrift placed the city under siege, and after a week of heavy street-to-street fighting, the last of the remaining syndicalists surrendered. The orchestrators of the rebellion including Strong were tried and convicted by the Pacific court, all of them receiving imprisonment for their sedition.\n\nEven though the rebellion had been crushed in the early days of the war, the devastation caused by the ensuing battle could still be seen. President [NEE.GetLeader] gave a brief speech thanking the city of Seattle for its loyalty to American democracy and thanked them for their perseverance during the war despite the horrible conditions. [PSA.GetAdjective] General Vandegrift and New England General Shepherd were also present; both men were seen sharing a private talk, perhaps reminiscing their times together in the Marine Corps.

Friends that had been split apart from the war and had found themselves fighting for the true America were able to embrace each other once more.

They are now soldiers of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\nThe President of [NEE.GetName], [NEE.GetLeader] praised the Pacific States for their early entry into the great civil war.

In America's darkest hours as thousands fled from the violence that consumed the country - New England was a bastion of freedom and democracy. New Englanders saw the Entente as the greatest rival towards radicalism and the Canadian government as the bearer of the torch of liberty in the Western Hemisphere. As America became torn apart in the civil war, the people of New England hoped that the nation would be reunited with the Entente's support once more.\n\nHowever, in a move that shocked the government of New England - the Canadian government fell to authoritarianism and the iron rule of the English king.

Magnuson’s campaign has focused on promoting a more progressive agenda for the country. Much of Magnuson's campaign policies are derived from his running mate, Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson. Firmly committed to civil rights, environmental issues, and human rights, the Democratic party hopes to rebuild their voter base amongst classical Democratic voters and tap into the growing movement of the Progressive Party.\n\nOpposing Magnuson for the Republican party, is Richard Nixon. A fellow veteran of the civil war, Nixon enlisted in the navy of the Pacific States just a few months prior to his graduation from the University of Duke due to the outbreak of the war. Nixon gained political prominence following the civil war, when he joined the House of Anti-American Activities.

He attended Norwich University for a year before receiving an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1913. Prominent in school activities such as horse riding, hockey, football, and boxing - Harmon's time at West Point also drew him close to fellow graduate Mark W. Clark. In 1921, he was assigned to West Point as an instructor in mechanical drawing, and his additional duties included coaching for the football team and West Point's first lacrosse team. He would serve in the 6th Cavalry Regiment in Georgia and four years as a Professor of Military Science and Commandant of Cadets at Norwich. In 1933, he graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College, and in 1934, he became a graduate of the United States Army War College.
