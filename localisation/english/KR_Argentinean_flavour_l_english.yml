 arg_flavour.1.d:0 "To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the foundation of Buenos Aires by conquistador Don Pedro de Mendoza, a colossal monument has been erected on the Plaza de la Republica. Standing at the intersection of the Corrientes and 9 de julio avenues, two of the Paris of South America’s most lively streets, the obelisk is 235 feet tall, a testament for the ages of our capital’s history.\n\nWith its construction delayed by the tumultuous political events of recent times, the monument was designed by rationalist architect Alberto Prebisch and built in a record time of 31 days by the German-Argentine Compañía General de Obras Públicas, who employed 157 workers in the construction. Over 200.000 pesos were invested, in what has become one of the most important and costly architectural endeavours in the city’s history.\n\nDespite the government’s intention of honouring Buenos Aires’ status as the nation’s capital, the effort has been received with some controversy by the city’s inhabitants, with many considering the building an \"ugly and unappealing pole of cement\". Regardless of the sneers and protests, we can only hope that eventually porteños will come to accept this new addition to the city’s patrimony."

 arg_flavour.2.d:0 "우루과이 출신 극작가 오라시오 실베스트레 키로가 포르테사가 호세 데 산마르틴 대학병원에서 숨을 거두었습니다. 그는 전립선암 말기를 진단받았으나, 병이 더 진행되기 전에 자살을 선택하여 아르헨티나 문학계는 더욱 충격에 빠졌습니다. 아르헨티나 작가 협회 (SADE)가 장례식 준비를 하는 동안, 키로가의 열성팬들은 아르헨티나 최고의 공포, 비극 작가였던 그를 추모하기 위해 신문기사를 쓰고 있으며, 이제 '사랑, 광기, 그리고 죽음의 이야기'와 같은 책들은 아르헨티나의 고전 문학이 되었습니다."

 arg_flavour.10.d:0 "The Partido Popular Democratico's founder, Lisandro de la Torre, has been found dead today in his apartment in Buenos Aires. The progressive politician, having largely taken a harsher stance towards conservatives after the assassination of Enzo Bordabehere, stepped down from public life after the Liga Patriótica's Coup in hopes of avoiding a political retaliation. However, it seems his own personal life was what got to him in the end, as a quick investigation has labelled his death as a suicide, with him even sending farewell letters to his close friends before shooting himself. Leaving behind a controversial legacy standing in the middle ground between revolutionaries and conservatives, the public still holds him in high esteem as many have attended his funeral, possibly thanks to his investigation of German intervention in the meat market in 1933."

 arg_flavour.11.d:0 "The Buenos Aires underground, which opened in 1913, was the first metro system on the South American continent and even in the whole Southern Hemisphere. Little expansion has been done in the last decades, and continued immigration to the city from the impoverished countryside and the massive influx of European immigrants has left our public transportation system severely lacking, leading to the government proposal to nationalize the network to allow for better expansion and to meet the demands created by the city's population explosion. And now, after several months of work, a new line \"D\" for the system has been completed, linking Catedral to Tribunales. The people of Buenos Aires are impatiently awaiting the opening ceremony!"

 arg_flavour.13.d:0 "The movie 'La Vida de Carlos Gardel' ('The Life of Carlos Gardel') has premiered today in Argentine cinemas and has been greatly received by the public. Directed by Alberto de Zavalia and sporting famous Argentine Actors like Hugo del Carril and Delia Garces, the movie has drawn some controversy due to the way the plot diverges from Gardel's personal story. The plot revolves around Gardel, falling in love with a woman as he grows famous as an artist, only to sadly lose her love when he begins his international tour, ending with his ultimate demise in a plane crash; the woman is then only left with Gardel's records, but the story ends happily as they both reunite as ghosts. The issue raised by many of Gardel's most loyal fans is that the artist never had any public relationships with any woman and that the movie is taking a purposefully fictional take on the artist. The producers, however, have defended their work, claiming it was never meant to be a biography in return."

 arg_flavour.14.d:0 "Previous to La Bombonera, the football club 'Boca Juniors' had used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. Club's first ground had been located in Dársena Sur of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) and Isla Demarchi before moving to Brandsen and Del Crucero streets in 1924.\n\nIn 1931, the Boca Juniors' steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands from the Municipality of Buenos Aires for A$$ 2,200,000. Three years later the club published a call for tenders to build its new stadium. Economic hardship due to the Black Monday disaster and the inability to find proper architects delayed the construction of the new stadium until 1938 when the club played their last match before the great work began.\n\nFinally opening on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarcón. Even though the station was freshly built, it lacked a lighting system which forced the game to end by the 70th minute."

 arg_flavour.15.d:0 "Adolfo Bioy Casares has published today what can be considered the start of a new phase in his writing career, a short novel titled \"The Invention of Morel\", the first major work of science fiction in Hispanic literature. The book tells the story of a Venezuelan writer, by the name of \"El Fugitivo\", who, hiding from the law, casts away in a remote Pacific island where a strange disease seems to exist. Soon a group of people arrive, leading him to hide from them in fear of being turned in. However, he can’t help falling in love with one of them, a mysterious woman named Faustine who doesn’t seem to notice his presence. After a succession of anomalous events involving the strangers and the very nature of the island, El Fugitivo soon realises that the visitors are not what they appear.\n\nTouching themes such as madness, solitude and love, the book has accomplished both commercial and critical success, with fellow author Jorge Luis Borges writing that \"To classify it as perfect is neither an imprecision nor a hyperbole\". Bioy Casares, a friend of figures such as Borges and the Ocampo sisters, considers the book the true beginning of his writing career. Despite his status as a relatively obscure writer, it has become obvious that the novel will have a great influence on Argentine literature."

 arg_flavour.12.d:0 "Today, after a gunfight with the police in the town of San Pedro de Atuel, the famous rural outlaw Juan Bautista Bairoletto has been declared dead. While the official version is that he was killed in the firefight, it has become a popular myth that he shot himself to avoid the dishonour of being captured. An almost legendary figure for the Argentine rural population, his death will undoubtedly be mourned by many.\n\nBorn in 1894, the son of Italian immigrants, Bairoletto was raised in a little town in the province of La Pampa. There, he occasionally broke the law through petty thefts and vagrancy, until a romantic dispute over a local prostitute ended in his assassination of the commissar of the town, causing him to become an outlaw. After this event, his criminal career quickly became well-known, with each assault and escape making him more admired by the people. Notably, Bairoletto stole from the rich and shared his profits with the poor, leading to him being known as the \"Argentine Robin Hood\" and earning him the praise of the Argentine left, especially the anarchists.\n\nWhile his death will without question be a propaganda victory for the regime of Buenos Aires, it can’t be denied that for a significant part of the population, his demise is a sad reminder of the slow vanishing of the rural countryside traditions and the gaucho way of living."
