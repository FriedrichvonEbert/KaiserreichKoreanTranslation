 nfa.1.d:0 "제3공화국은 이전 정권과 같이 독일군에 의해 패배하고 사회주의자들의 저항에 직면하며 멸망하는 운명을 맞았습니다. 1920년의 코뮌 혁명 이후 발발한 내전이 종결되었을 때, 정부는 항복이 아닌 망명을 선택했습니다. 정부는 마르세유로 후퇴해 프랑스 해군 선단을 타고 알제로 향하며, 신생 프랑스 코뮌 연방이 의심의 여지없이 빠르게 자멸하거나 독일놈들에게 무너져 상황이 빠르게 해결되리라 믿고 있었습니다. 하지만, 둘 중 어떠한 일도 벌어지지 않았고 독일 제국은 망명한 기존 정부의 입장을 전혀 고려하지 않은 채 코뮌과 평화 협정을 맺었습니다. 코뮌은 새롭게 재편된 독일 동맹체계 소속국들에게 프랑스 공화국의 정당한 계승자로서 인정받게 되었고, 망명정부는 세계대전에서 같은 편에 섰던 국가들에게만 정통 정부로 인정받게 되었습니다. 그러나, 망명자들은 두려워하지 않았습니다. 그들은 자신들이 프랑스 본토 전역과 식민제국을 통치하는 정통정부임을, 그리고 협상국을 위해 계속 싸워 나갈 것을 천명했으며 본토를 공격하기 위한 준비를 계속해 나갔습니다.\n\n하지만, 망명의 여파는 국가를 매우 불안정하게 만들었습니다. 민주주의 세력들은 단결된 정부를 형성하는데 계속 실패하였고, 사소한 갈등들이 이어졌으며 설상가상으로 망명자들과 피에 누아르 이주민들 사이의 긴장 역시 상황을 더욱 악화시켰습니다. 이러한 상황에서 1926년, 군이 개입하여 비상사태를 선포하였고 베르됭의 사자, 필리프 페탱이 그의 제자 조르주 티에리 다르장리외 제독이나 앙리 모르닥 장군과 같은 세계대전 영웅들의 지원을 받아 이끄는 군정이 들어섰습니다. 프랑스군 최고사령관으로서 국가를 확고하게 통제하는 페탱은 분명 프랑스를 완벽하게 장악하고 있지만, 헌법은 개정되거나 무효화되지 않았으며, 의회는 원수와 간부의 결정을 따르는 거수기로 전락했지만 동시에 공화국과 그 행정기관들은 철폐되지 않고 서류상에서나마 계속 이어져 왔습니다. 정당들 역시 여전히 존재하고 있으며 대중들에게 민주주의의 환상을 주기 위해 계속 활동하고 있지만 이들이 어떠한 권력이라도 가지고 있다고 생각하는 이상주의자들은 거의 없습니다. 공화국에서 활동하고 있는 네 개의 주요 정당은 각각 급진당(RAD), 민주공화당(PRD), 기존의 자유적-보수적 정당들이 망명 후 결성한 프랑스 사회당(PSF), 그리고 악시옹 프랑세즈(AF)입니다."

After all, most are veterans. While upper ranking officers grumble about Mordacq’s proposal of a sweeping reorganisation of the armed forces, all can see the acuteness of his analysis and enjoy the scathing denunciations of both Kaiser and Communards. The Bear's calls to action, to reform, to be able to stand ready to strike against the Red at the first opportunity, echo throughout the République. Many are starting to consider Mordacq a potential political leader, and his calls for reorganisation are being assimilated with a more general discontentment with the political structures of the nation."

While it is nothing new to those that lived through it, many in the general public, particularly the younger generation, too young to have fought in the Grande Guerre, discover dumbfounded this uncomfortable truth: the defeat was by our own doing more than anything else. While the tactical and strategic reforms proposed in this essay by de Gaulle have been acclaimed by officers, it is the larger societal reform some see the Rooster hint at in his work that struck a chord for many in the armed forces, from the simple infantryman to the Lion of Verdun himself, and among civilians, particularly veterans: all those sacrifices, so much bloodshed, so many lives lost, how could they have not been enough to beat back the Boches? The issue must lie primarily elsewhere, in the government, too weak to impose its will upon the armed forces and far too willing to let them fall into fatal discord. Perhaps a stronger, more moral civilian power is needed.\n\nIn any case, de Gaulle, already a celebrated war hero and influential officer, is quickly becoming an even more popular figure, as many of those touched by his call to reform feel he is the perfect example a new generation of officers must aspire to be like, while some see in him the perfect man to help carry out those larger reforms, though the lieutenant-colonel himself is quick to defer any praise towards his \"mentor\", Philippe Pétain."

While only injuries and property damages have been reported, evidently this literary debate has crystallised much deeper issues in our nation and media, officers, and regular citizens alike feel compelled to choose a side.

As such, as Marshal Pétain seeks increased support from diverse powerful groups in his struggle with Mordacq’s partisans, he has found particular luck with the industrial upper classes, both grateful for the support that gave them the opportunity to strive after exile and deeply ideologically committed to the regime, believing a strong hand is needed to guide France towards salvation. However, to prevent these elites from being tempted by the more democratic forces within the République, many of Pétain’s advisors are suggesting a campaign of increased support and strategic investments: not only would this develop the nation’s economy and war capabilities even further, but by choosing carefully those who would benefit from these investments, for example both loyal supporters of the regime and those still tempted by Mordacq's rhetoric, the Lion’s grip on power could be restored, maybe even increased."

As such, the president’s advisors have put together a plan to silence rumours of any wrongdoing: a large scale anti-corruption drive, at all levels of society. By making corruption an even more serious offence, encouraging denunciation of even the slightest hint of it and more generally enforcing a renewed moral order within the administration and public services, the government hopes that the public will turn a blind eye to Pétain’s recent promises of support and investment to various groups, individuals and industries.\n\nHowever, a fair amount of resources will be needed to fuel this drive, and though this plan could help Philippe Pétain maintain power some in the government argue that these resources could be better used to try to find even more support for the regime, while others argue that these measures could alienate parts of the administration."

 nfa.35.d:0 "As the full scale of the deeply rooted corruption plaguing the Pétain government had been revealed over the last few weeks in the press, disbelief was quickly replaced by anger and protests in the streets calling for the president’s resignation grew in size with each passing day. The Marshal, either unwilling or unable to take any radical action to protect his regime had stayed oddly silent, holed up in the presidential Summer Palace in the heights of Algiers as unrest flared up all around him, his support among both the people and the elites he had tried so hard to rally quickly withering. All could see the writing on the wall, his rule could not last much longer, there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to sell out the country to hold on to power, was left.\n\nToday, what all were expecting finally happened. In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of protests instead seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarters of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. In a short radio speech, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq, rose to deliver a clearly well-rehearsed speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his government, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the Constitutional Laws, relating to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the shady dealings revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with tense applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial."

Coincidentally present in the building, General Mordacq immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio, promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, promising new elections in the near future and eventually a new constitution. Despite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters hope for radical reform and a more democratic future.

Passion for truth, passion for justice, and passion for our country. I therefore ask the public to remember that, while we are prosecuting a defendant today, History will judge the judges themselves one day.\"\n\nWith these words, the president of the High Court opened the first hearing of a long trial to prosecute Pétain, accused of corruption, treason and conspiracy against the République. Determined to defend his honour, Marshal Pétain prepared both his defence and his memoirs from his cell in the Casbah of Algiers, only allowed visits by his wife and his lawyer. Appearing in court in full uniform, after a short statement on the first day of his trial asserting that all of his actions as president had been taken in the interest of the salvation of France and that he was only responsible in front of the French people and not the High Court, the former president stayed silent as witnesses after witnesses corroborated the accusations lobbied against him. After weeks of passionate debate, the sentence has finally been given: death. At this verdict, the Marshal who had stayed so stoic briefly showed weakness, lost his composure, briefly the Lion of Verdun turned into Philippe Pétain, a tired old man of more than 80 years of age.\n\nPublic opinion is incredibly divided, but it seems that if most wanted the Marshal gone from power, the majority thinks any sentence would be going too far, let alone the death penalty. Wanting to avoid making this trial too overtly partisan, Henri Mordacq has thus far stayed silent, however as president it is within his power to commute Pétain’s sentence. What should the Bear do?"

Nevertheless, their support and expertise has proved invaluable for the regime and Pétain has met repeatedly with representatives from the organisation, taking some of its members as special advisors to help him navigate the crisis currently unfolding and the ideas of the Redressement Français will no doubt have a tremendous amount of influence in the decisions taken by the Marshal going forward."

Marshal Pétain’s gamble to hold on power has paid off: with the Redressement Français’ precious help, he has managed to thoroughly secure the support of the upper classes, rekindle the admiration of the people, and calm down social unrest. The democratic camp still exists, but it has been severely weakened by media attacks and backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans, its support base greatly eroded by the government’s promises of reform. It’s rumoured that Mordacq himself has struck a deal with the government. Many thought this would be the end of his regime, and yet Philippe Pétain emerges from this crisis stronger than ever: The Bear’s faction is no longer a threat, and the people once again have put their trust in the Lion of Verdun. While the Marshal has had a strong grip on politics since the revolution, it seems that now nothing can stop him from truly reforming the republic according to his wishes.\n\nOr, some whisper, according to the Redressement Français’ wishes. Its help proved decisive: on an ideological level, as many of the reforms proposed by Pétain are lifted straight from their ideas, and on the material level, the Renewal having turned itself into the propaganda arm of the government during the crisis, funding and organising its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime’s stabilisation came in large part thanks to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think tank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and, more importantly, with Pétain’s trust and gratitude. They will no doubt have a large influence shaping the future of the République, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group’s writings. In any case, now that the crisis is over the entire nation’s attention is turned towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. The people now fully united behind Marshal Pétain, finally free from petty divisions, is ready to save the Patrie."

Panicked and determined to complete the mission, Lelong fired two bullets into the Marshal's chest, and a third went to lodge in the General's head beside him. Both collapsed to the ground, covered in blood. Lelong then threw his weapon away, and ran back to the toilet before speeding out through the window overlooking the back of the building.

Immediately transferred to a secret location near Algiers, news of his arrest was triumphantly spread by the government to the media, feeding them a colourful story of the fool Mordacq conspiring with Communards agents to take down the Pétain government and invite the Reds in. While it’s undeniable that some supporters of Mordacq had ties to the more left wing pre-war parties and some of those arrested have confessed under strong interrogation techniques to be on the Commune’s payroll, the evidence of such collusion is light at best. Despite being offered a generous deal in exchange for his confession, Mordacq himself so far refuses to admit doing anything wrong. Surprisingly, many are openly doubting the official story. Arresting such a popular war hero is not going well even among strong supporters of the regime, particularly veterans who remember very well the heroic defence of Arras, and even within the army many who would have been at worst apathetic with repressing the democratic movement are now outraged that the government would go so far.\n\nIn any case, what Pétain feared happened: Henri Mordacq is now a martyr. Open contestation from the army is unprecedented, and many within the government are starting to panic and advise a balanced approach: doubling down on the repression, going after those now protesting against Mordacq’s arrest, while at the same time pulling back somewhat, transfer Mordacq out of hiding, and give him a public trial."

Wanting to stay discreet, the escort had been kept to a minimum and was swiftly dealt with, those attempting to resist shot dead, Mordacq escorted to a car and the convoy set on fire all in the span of less than five minutes. Survivors of the attack describe the prisoner as being just as surprised as his escort that this was happening, but clearly someone coordinated this attack from the inside: not only was this transfer supposed to be a secret to even most of the government, but a fake itinerary had been disseminated by intelligence agents and a decoy convoy had been organised. Whoever leaked the information must have been either very well connected, or is very high up in the chain of command. An investigation has of course been launched and all police are on high alert, but while the violence of Mordacq’s partisans has earned the regime some sympathy, this spectacular evasion has thrown the government in total panic: not only this shows to the eyes of the world that the regime is losing control, but it shows our people that the democratic movement has very influential friends. In any case, the few advisors still advocating for moderation when dealing with the democratic camp have been thoroughly disgraced with some even under heavy suspicion of being Mordacq sympathisers and those advocating for harsher repression now have the Marshal’s ear."

However, this treatment was reserved for civilians, as the government and intelligence services were careful to preserve the reputation of the armed forces, dissenters generally being simply sent on assignment in the middle of the Sahara where their concerns wouldn’t bother anyone. However, with Mordacq’s arrest shocking many, it’s been decided that the large amount of information collected over the years by the intelligence services on soldiers and officers alike would be put to good use. The latest victim of such attempted blackmail is admiral Lucien Lacaze, a known supporter of Mordacq and well liked, successful, and above all morally irreproachable officer.

Admiral Lacaze has been made into a new martyr for the democratic camp, and though he retired in the wake of the scandal, it seems he is now in direct contact with Mordacq's partisans. Although this drastically hinders our plans to deal with dissent among the armed forces with some subtlety, there are far more worrying things: not only we have lost whatever trust officers still put in the regime, but the leaflets currently spreading like wildfire contain confidential documents concerning the fabrication of the various scandals, implicating in this defamation campaign high ranking officers as well many within the administration and in the government. There is only one possible conclusion: there is a mole among us and we need to catch her to prevent more leaks."

But it seems that following the Lacaze Affair and the subsequent revelations leaked to soldiers, officers, and eventually the general public, many outraged officers have ignored this principle, and suddenly decided to walk down the streets to protest. While our forces were supposed to suppress any protest, many police and military officers are confused by this unusual situation and decided to simply stand aside to avoid fighting their comrades and friends. Many civilians are watching this protest out of curiosity, and it is now obvious for everyone that Pétain’s rule is far from being popular even within the armed forces, traditionally the one place where the regime was most secure. Since protests are banned for active duty soldiers, the official version of events is that those officers are simply \"parading\", a term that most opposition journals, underground or miraculously still being openly published, are now using ironically to designate these protests. The \"Parades\" have been going on for days now, and it is time we choose how to deal with the situation. In the meantime; the 2nd Bureau is still investigating to find the mole that created this ridiculous situation in the first place."

In any case, the number of protesters is increasing each day, and our forces still refuse to take any active action against them, at best barring access to the way to the presidential palace and other important government buildings, with discrete but numerous gestures of solidarity between the two. The most radical forces within the regime believe it would be better to act immediately and that it might already be too late to stop Mordacq, still on the run."

All were expecting the Marshal to strike, many were ready to die in the streets, and yet, Pétain did nothing. If this was done hoping the people would calm down, it was foolish as there was no going back: in the people’s mind the Lion of Verdun was gone, only Pétain, seemingly so willing to brutalise his people to hold on to power was left."

In the early hours of the morning, army and police units deployed to maintain order in expectation of another day of parades instead joined the protests led by Mordacq himself and seized all strategic points of Algiers, occupying the Palace of Government, headquarter of the colonial administration, the National Assembly and surrounding the presidential palace. Even if Pétain had tried to strike, this was in fact doomed from the start: most the 2nd Bureau, the secret services, was compromised and cooperating with the Bear’s partisans, the \"leaks\" were entirely purposeful. In a short radio speech, the first since his arrest and subsequent escape, General Mordacq called for calm and order and announced that a special session of the lower and upper chambers would be convened together in the day for a special session in the Consular Palace. In the afternoon, with most of the members of parliament assembled, a député, known supporter of Mordacq and freshly freed from jail, rose to deliver an improvised speech condemning the actions of the Marshal and his tyrannical regime, invoking the articles 6 and 12 of the suspended Constitutional Laws, relative to the penal responsibility of the president and his ministers in cases of high treason and the right of the Assemblée to charge him and his ministers of such an offence, ending his speech with a long list of the numerous grievous crimes revealed in the last few weeks and a call for an immediate vote, met with thunderous applause, followed by a near unanimous decision to charge the president.\n\nMinutes after this, troops surrounding the presidential palace forced entry into the building, only lightly defended by a few presidential guardsmen still foolishly loyal to the Marshal. There they found Philippe Pétain, in full marshal uniform, his ceremonial baton in hand, waiting for them alone in his office: staying silent as he was served his warrant for high treason, the old man did not attempt to resist arrest, merely looking startled when some men refused to return his military salute, and was quickly transferred to the Casbah garrison within the city to await his trial, held in the same high security cell that had been prepared for Henri Mordacq."

While there is no constitutional provision for the creation of such a committee, there is historical precedent, and the Chamber of Deputies is, after all, the sovereign authority in the Republic and can distribute power as it sees fit. While some deputies abstained, the majority voted in favour of the proposal and no name other than that of General Henri Mordacq, hero of the struggle against the tyrannical Pétain, was proposed to head the committee, an eagerness possibly helped by the presence of soldiers loyal to the Bear guarding all exits of the room. Present in the building, the General immediately delivered a passionate speech broadcast on radio promising to free the République of corruption, maintain the fundamental liberties, new elections once the situation stabilises and eventually the redaction of a new constitution.\n\nDespite the late hour, celebrations spontaneously broke out in the streets of all major cities as Mordacq's supporters are finally able to show themselves after months of repression. Despite Pétain’s best efforts, a new dawn is rising on the French Republic and the Bear’s promised reforms can only strengthen the country for the war that is inevitably coming."

 nfa.52.d:0 "As the crisis unfolds, it’s quickly becoming obvious that the regime has lost most of its base of support. Veterans are shocked by the actions of the man they have revered for so long, and La Grande Muette is making herself heard loud and clear: she is outraged by the government’s repression. The government desperately needs allies, and it seems at least one group in part might be interested in such a partnership: the royalist Action Française. Indeed, today Charles de Gaulle came to discuss privately with Marshal Pétain about a potential alliance of circumstances. The Rooster seems to have taken upon himself to act as link between his mentor and the party he has never hidden sympathies for and though the national integralists have been consistently and brazenly opposed to the République, considering Pétain’s regime as barely a step up from the weak pre-war government, they share a common trait: distrust for parliamentary democracy and the liberal parties whose rule led to the fall of France in the first place.\n\nAs such, the Action Française is suggesting unofficial cooperation with the regime, at least until the crisis is over, a partnership that could prove salutatory for the Lion and his government. As an old, very well established party the French Action has many sympathisers among both the upper and lower classes, within the Church, the army and even enjoys some popularity with the native population, drawn in by promises of decentralisation and respect of local customs. Its daily newspaper is among the most widely read in the nation, and the party controls a network of \"newspaper vendors\", the Camelots du Roi, the King's Camelots, a security service made up of youngsters and students that some describe as a paramilitary force, used to street brawls and crowd control. Finally, some of the more radical members of the AF have hinted at being willing to use every tool at their disposal to take more \"direct action\" against the democratic camp. All of this could be used to serve the regime and finally end the crisis once and for all.\n\nHowever this partnership could alienate the last few loyal partisans of Pétain, and there is no doubt that the services of the AF would come at the cost of compromise with them down the road. But the regime might simply not survive the next few weeks if we don’t take this deal."

Using its vast network of influence in the upper classes and the armed forces, the party has managed to soothe some of the dissent coming from there, and the Camelots du Roi now show up every day to push back against the protests and secure key areas, not showing the same hesitation as the regular forces to fight those still parading and not having any care for regulations or avoiding injuries. It would seem like the regime can breathe a great sigh of relief, as Mordacq's movement is now far less ascendant.\n\nHowever, part of the loss of ground for the democratic camp is due to the brutal tactics of the more radical elements of the French Action, who have organised themselves in a highly structured, secretive and independent group to take direct action against the Bear’s supporters, with little to no oversight by the party and none from the government. Intimidation, assassination, and even bombings, in the last few weeks it seems nothing is too far for them to take down the democratic camp. Nicknamed the Organisation des Quatre Cents Coups, the Four Hundreds Blows Organisation or less literally, Organisation to Raise Hell, it’s impossible to deny that they have been incredibly effective in suppressing our opponents but the Lion himself is quietly horrified by the terroristic nature of the group."

Nevertheless, their resources, expertise and extensive links to the elites could prove to be salvation for the regime, whatever is left of it. Asking the Marshal to form a new government filled with members of the organisation and essentially a free hand to reform the country according to their ideals, in exchange they promise that they will do everything in their power to end the crisis.

Marshal Pétain’s gamble to hold on to power had almost failed, but when all seemed lost the Redressement Français’ precious help saved the day. The group managed to first thoroughly secure to support of the upper classes, anxious over the crisis unfolding, and create a media offensive putting all the blame of the recent repressive and abusive decisions of the regime on sycophants taking advantage of the elderly Marshal, many of whom have already been arrested on treason and corruption charges, a lie that many in the nation are more than happy to believe, civilians, veterans, soldiers and officers alike. The democratic camp still very much exists, but through backroom deals with many of its more prominent partisans and promises of reform, its support is rapidly eroding. The parades are still a daily event, but they are rapidly shrinking in size and it’s rumoured that Mordacq himself is striking a deal with the government, with talks of total amnesty for his partisans and a comfortable retirement for himself.\n\nThough he is still of course the head of state, the political genius Pétain is long gone: only a tired old man rapidly distancing himself from day to day rule is left and some whisper he has merely become a figurehead for the Redressement Français. All the reforms proposed by the government are lifted straight from their ideas, and the Renewal has turned itself into the propaganda arm of the regime, organising and funding its counter attack in the public and private sphere. The regime’s stabilisation is entirely due to their effort, and both Pétain and the members of the think thank know it. Many have been handsomely rewarded with influential positions in government and administration, and the more cynical among our citizens claim you could predict the future by simply reading the group’s writings. In any case, now that the crisis is dying down the entire nation’s attention is once again turning towards the métropole: the situation in Europe is evolving quickly, and an opportunity to strike and liberate the mainland could come at any moment. Uniting behind the figure of the Lion of Verdun, the people will soon be ready to save the patrie, and the French Renewal has a free rein to reform the nation so that she is capable to do so."

One day some soldiers had brought their service weapons, pretexting a need for self-defence, the next the Camelots themselves were armed and in reaction to this both police and military deployed to maintain order brought out heavier weaponry. Furthermore, while the violence against Mordacq’s partisans had intimidated many, it also brought them much sympathy from the general public and as such more and more civilians took part in the parades. What had started as a rather absurd display of anger by the Grande Muette was now a daily tense standoff from sunrise to sundown, with occasional brawls between protesters and camelots. Miraculously, despite the numerous injuries sustained in the daily brawls, no deaths had occurred at the parades.\n\nThat is, until today. As one of the usual fights broke out between protesters and camelots, a shot rang out, followed by a cry of pain. No one knows who fired it or where it came from, but after a split second of shocked silence, there was chaos. More and more gunshots came from each side, and with each one protesters, camelots, police and military fell to the ground, some wounded, some dead. Initially overwhelmed, the regime forces quickly regained their composure, the sight of their dead comrades shedding any feelings of hesitation they might have had towards fighting against fellow soldiers. Things quickly turned to street to street fighting, with barricades being hastily constructed by protesters engaging in what could only be described as a fighting retreat: most of them being active duty soldiers or veterans, there was certainly confusion, but no panic. Though they have been pushed back to the littoral, the protesters remain in firm control of much of centre of Algiers as the government forces await further orders."

Talks with the protesters had gone nowhere, and the lack of central leadership among them would make any consensus impossible anyway. A tense silence had fallen on the conference room in the presidential palace, broken only by the sound of the occasional gunshots. Then, news came: the protesters have seized heavy machine guns, and chosen to fall back further and fortify a large plaza where a field hospital had been set up. Any assault would be extremely costly, and everyone in the room knew it. And then, quietly, almost a whisper:\n\n\"... shell them\".\n\nA young navy officer had broken the silence. He continued: \"We could shell them. The Liberté class dreadnought Démocratie is anchored a few miles from Algiers, if we wait until nightfall and order her to shell the plaza, it would create enough confusion to storm the camp while minimising damage to the city and losses for our forces. They’re expecting an assault from land, certainly not from the sea\". After a few seconds of silence, the Lion of Verdun angrily stood up, but before he could speak Charles de Gaulle, the Rooster, intervened: \"I’m afraid we have no choice here. If we let the situation fester, we could wake up tomorrow morning to a general insurrection: we must nip this revolution in the bud and act fast. I’m sorry Marshal but now is the time of action, not debate.\".\n\nAnd so, as Philippe Pétain fell silent, the order was given."

Tales of mangled bodies, of brutal treatment of prisoners, of summary executions are being spread by communard agents, but our nation knows the truth: the next morning, the front page of all newspapers read: \"Attempted Coup Bravely Defeated\". The threat posed by these red traitors has finally been dealt with: the few remaining so-called democrats are now either in custody, awaiting trial for their crimes, in hiding, though they will be found sooner or later, or they lie dead in a mass grave slowly filling up as the plaza is being cleaned up. Henri Mordacq, or what was left of his body, was found and identified by his uniform: the Bear himself is dead and we can now breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nMarshal Pétain is however deeply affected by what happened and has not left the presidential palace since, refusing to see anyone other than his wife and his confessor, only occasionally wandering outside of his quarters, mumbling to himself. As such, Charles de Gaulle has unofficially stepped in to help run governmental affairs for the time being: after all, who better than the Lion’s protégé to make sure things go smoothly in these critical times? Having been promoted to the rank of general for his bravery and skill dealing with the crisis, France’s stability is now the utmost priority of the Rooster, and as such he has launched a new large scale investigation to find and bring to justice any and all of those who might have been involved in this attempted coup.

Though we could have feared instability after the Marshal’s temporary condition had been made public, de Gaulle’s energetic guidance, his status as a respected war hero, as protégé of Pétain, and his own personal prestige alleviated the fears of many.

The defeats, the struggles, the sacrifices now all make sense: our efforts had been sabotaged, wasted by inside forces.\n\nHowever, our efforts to finally once and for all deal with the parasites plaguing the patrie are still being restricted by petty liberal concerns, and de Gaulle realises that extraordinary measures must be taken to ensure the salvation of France. As such he has come to Philippe Pétain with a proposal: for the Lion of Verdun to resign as president of the French Republic to enjoy a glorious retirement and be able to care for his clearly ailing health, and for a motion to be presented in front of the National Assembly granting the government full powers to create and promulgate a new constitution, better suited to defend national interests.

However, since the names of those accused were published and placarded everywhere, a new wave of violence has swept through the nation. Overzealous camelots have been targeting the family and friends of those on trial, as well as more generally all and any open republicans, with harassment and rapidly escalating violence. Yesterday, it was jeers and insults, today, beatings and property damage, but with the police rarely intervening, who knows where it will stop. The population, taken in the frenzy and wanting to make those responsible for France’s suffering pay has started joining as well, often collectively proving more violent against the perceived enemies of the patrie than the most committed of the camelots. Some are fleeing, others hope the collective wrath will simply pass, though it is quickly becoming uncontrollable. The political disagreements of yesterday have turned into blind rage, and some are even taking advantage of the general frenzy to settle personal feuds, either joining the mob and influencing it into going after personal enemies, or denouncing as liberals, as Mordacq-sympathiser, as republicans whoever slighted them. However, this orgy of violence could prove cathartic for our people, as they can finally rest easy knowing the enemy within will no longer hinder. Finally the patrie can move forward, first by reforming herself following our king’s guidance, and then by setting her sights on the métropole, still reeling under communard oppression."

However, many of those reforms were already controversial atop the chain of command, and now that they are being implemented, they have put some within the armed forces on high alert regarding the next moves of General Mordacq. Furthermore, the call for deep reform by the new head of state is seen by many civilians as a prelude to the restoration of democratic life, though Mordacq has so far not challenged the state of emergency that has held France in democratic limbo for the last decade. The simmering hope has reached the ranks of the military, among which many already anxious at the prospect of the military reforms are at best sceptical of an eventual return to parliamentary democracy as war looms ever closer. A worry that their fellow reactionary officers have been quick to exploit, convincing some former Pétain loyalists that Mordacq was a poor choice over the much more conservative de Gaulle.\n\nIn any case, this barrack gossip is unlikely to have deeper consequences, Mordacq is a respected theorist and war hero, and the appointed successor of the Lion of Verdun. We could, however, contact the old Marshal, and ask him to briefly come out of retirement for a speech addressed to the troops not so subtly calling for more unity within the ranks."

Each and every one of them listened intently to the man who so recently still dominated the life of the nation, from the humblest of infantrymen to the most decorated officers present. They all heard loud and clear the message the Marshal was methodically laying out. Taking the tone of a disappointed grandfather, he compared the current situation of France to a lengthy trek across the hostile desert, where every resource is precious but the most important thing is cohesion within the group, for men to trust and rely on each other so that they may reach their destination. He strongly praised his successor and reaffirmed his trust in Mordacq’s ability and deeply reform the nation and her armed forces, before announcing that he would fully retire from public life, an announcement that ushered a wave of shock and whispers across the room. Receiving a standing ovation no less sincere than the one he received when he resigned as head of state, the Marshal reminded his great call of Verdun, one, last, time."

As such, the Deuxième Bureau has taken over the investigation, believing that this is the work of forces opposed to the regime. The democratic press has not waited for confirmation, however, and already calls the man a victim of the Action Française. The royalist newspaper, on the other hand, is all but celebrating the news, being quick to point out that the man’s purpose in the seedy area remains unknown, peddling theories to besmirch the memory of the officer, ranging from a visit to the Casbah’s brothels to ominous conspiracy with supposed Communard agents."

As such, the various parties still exist, with a presidential coalition and an opposition publicly debating, though no one in the République is foolish enough to believe they hold any kind of real power. However, emboldened by the election of Henri Mordacq that they perceive as a friend to the cause of democracy, the long slumbering political parties have finally awakened. Though they would never dare publicly denounce the regime that they have dutifully supported since the exile, representatives from the main parties asked for a discrete private meeting with the Bear.\n\nThere, they explained their concerns to General Mordacq. While some among them spoke of the ideals of the Republic, of the moral duty to restore democracy, most had reached a much more practical conclusion: the people are losing trust in the regime, and its future seems bleak. For now, the popular hope for reform has focused around Mordacq. Despite his calls for deep reform, he remains largely politically aligned with the Pétain regime, with the same unflinching aim: retaking the métropole and taking down the Reds. As such, these deputies have proposed simply giving in to popular demands, declaring the state of emergency over, restoring the constitutional laws for the good of the stability of the republic, and calling for new elections, allowing a semblance of normal democratic life to flourish once again in the Republic.\n\nThe General was not unmoved by such arguments but has refused to give a straight answer regarding his intentions."

We believe they are the men behind the slaughter in the Casbah, and according to our infiltrated agents of the Second Bureau, they are preparing their next move. If we are not careful, their influence could become strong enough to carry on a coup against our regime.\n\nBut we will not stay around idly, we must take proactive steps. With the help of the Second bureau, we might be able to counter their move and prevent a coup, but our success remains uncertain in these conditions. To better the odds, we could try to contact the leaders of the various parties represented in parliament: although they have de facto little political power, they still have deep connections to the financial and industrial elite of our country and might be able to successfully deprive the Action Française of its financial support. Furthermore, de La Rocque’s PSF could provide invaluable help in preventing a coup.

The defeat and the revolution had already severely damaged the image of the République, recent events made sure few were still truly attached to her.

Under their rule, she had often been martyred, defaced by radical avant-garde architecture and urban planning. Many buildings had been damaged during the revolution, and now the war has brought more destruction: as such, plans for the restoration of the City of Lights to her pre-revolutionary beauty have already been hastily thrown together as we discover the damage for the first time. However, one question remains: what should be done with Montmartre? The hill, towering above Paris, has a rich history: starting point of the 1871 Commune, later on a romantic village within the city and most importantly where an immense neo-byzantine basilica, the Sacré-Cœur, was being built, funded by donations from all over France. Close to completion when the revolution broke out, the basilica was never consecrated and was the site of a last hold out of loyalist forces. Damaged by the fighting, the building was gleefully torn down by the Communards, who saw it as a reactionary symbol as it was built to expiate the crimes of the original Commune of Paris. In its stead they built a modernist Palace of the People, where their attempt at government met.\n\nWe have received multiple proposals for the future of Montmartre, what should be done?"

Many are present, stoic, or dazed, or crying hysterically. Some are still in hiding, some fled, and will have to be condemned in absentia. Each case is carefully examined by a court of officers, the defendant is charged with treason, mutiny, desertion, conspiracy against France, sometimes other accusations, and the verdict falls, inevitably: Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.\n\nOne question remains, how to sentence the guilty. The typical sentence for military traitors is death by firing squad, however, even among our own military, there are calls for leniency on some of these officers, as they had contacted our intelligence services during or even before the war hoping to switch sides, arguing they had simply been thrust into serving a cause they did not believe in. Others argue that conflicts in the future are likely and that France cannot sacrifice talented officers."

Their names sound familiar to our people keenly informed these last few years of their numerous crimes against France during and since the revolution: Faure, Pivert, Thorez, Jouhaux, Blum, Laval, Sartre, and many, many others. They have been given ample time to prepare their defence, some doing so admirably, others going as far as testifying against each other in hopes of reducing their sentence, or on the contrary, choosing to remain entirely silent.\n\nMost of them have been found guilty of the crimes they were accused of: what should their sentence be? Death is the expected sentence, but this would certainly create martyrs. On the other hand, a lighter sentence could seem like a show of weakness to our supporters, and convincing our people that any of these Reds deserve mercy when they refused to show any to anyone standing in the way of their crazed revolution could prove difficult."

Simply put, our reconquered people are tearing each other apart, blowing up in anger for they finally see the Reds for what they truly are, enemies of France who led them all to their collective downfall. However, these trials may have gone somewhat out of control, with unsavoury reports coming in of cruel punishments or settling of personal vendettas by the simple accusation of being a committed socialist.

For others, it is a tragedy: their kin might have disappeared, their neighbourhood destroyed during the war, or their property collectivised. Some scars will take generations to heal, but the most pressing issue is that of seized property: many are clamouring for what was theirs to be given back.\n\nWe could simply declare all transfer of property undertaken under the syndicalist regime to be null, but expropriating untold numbers of families would certainly not endear us to our reunited people. We could also accept the status quo, legitimise the ownership of seized property, and simply give indemnities to the exiles, but this might feel like a slap in the face to many. Finally, we could set up local committees investigating the claims of returning owners, which would then find a fair compromise between both parties, though this might prove complex and time-consuming."

The ambassador said the French government is hoping that the congress would be an occasion to draft an official peace and a deeper cooperation between Paris and Berlin. It would also be a rare moment to discuss the history and future of the troubled Franco-German relationship, a history filled with wars and rivalry, and Verdun being one of its symbols. It's at Verdun that millions died in 1916 in the Weltkrieg, it was also in Verdun that the territories of France and Germany were first separated in 843 by the heirs of Charlemagne.\n\nHow should we answer this attempt for peace?"

 nfa.239.d:0 "Today, Colonel François de La Rocque handed over his resignation as Chief of the Council of Ministers to President Mordacq. Tensions in the wide Union Sacrée coalition around the Colonel had reached a boiling point, as the representatives of the traditional parties of the Third Republic could not bring themselves to agree with the wide political reforms envisioned by the PSF and worked tirelessly behind the scenes to reinforce their positions and bring back some lost prestige to their parties and to the traditional democratic institutions of the Republic. It is even rumoured that Mordacq himself intervened to prevent the coalition from entirely breaking apart in these critical times, and personally asked for the formation of a new government as a conciliatory measure. This new government headed by the PRD’s Paul Reynaud was presented to the Assembly later in the day and passed a near unanimous vote of confidence.\n\nOf course, this change in course does not mean that the PSF or de La Rocque are now in opposition with the government, and the Colonel himself does not see this as the end of his bid for power: after all the PSF is still an important party, and future electoral fortunes could certainly bring him back in the forefront of politics. In the meantime however, the party will have to take a secondary role in the coalition, a blow to its aspirations of deep reforms of the institutions of the Republic."

Today, the Colonel announced in front of the Assembly his plans for a constitutional referendum once the war is won, one that would thoroughly transform the institutions of the Republic and create a semi-presidential, democratic, more stable regime, instead of a Republic dominated by her fickle parliament. This was entirely expected of the Colonel, as this has been part of the PSF’s platform since the creation of the party. However, he ended this speech by saying that this constitutional reform would be voted on by referendum, as he argues that the French people are after all sovereign: for reform of such importance, they are the most qualified to decide upon the future of the nation.\n\nThis immediately created an uproar among partisans of the supremacy of parliament. Indeed the last time a referendum was used in such a way, it was by President Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte to bury the Second Republic. Name calling, accusations of tyranny flew across the hemicycle, members of parliament even came to blows, and by the end of the day it was clear the Union Sacrée had only the nominal support of much of his former allies. As such, a new government was formed under de La Rocque with those sympathetic to his plans, though President Mordacq intervened so that the appearance of unity remains in this critical time. The traditional parties of the Third Republic, in no small part responsible for her fall, have simply been left behind in the dust as Mordacq continues to revolutionise French politics."

And so, instead of heading back to the residence of the archbishops of Reims for a private reception, His Majesty chose to head out of the cathedral on foot accompanied by his young son, mingling for some time with his new subjects, almost to prove to the reconquered nation, and perhaps to himself, that this was all indeed real: the red beast was slain, the kingdom was well and truly reborn, this war pitting brothers against brothers was over. Henri VI then delivered a speech radio transmitted throughout France and her empire, assuring that with his coronation, a new era has dawned, an era of order, peace and prosperity, and that all the sacrifices France had endured will not be in vain.

But if the colours are uncontroversial, the presence of the royal arms on the flag is not. Adopted in exile, mostly out of practicality, many expect our current ensign to be replaced by a plain Tricolore, once and for all co-opting this symbol for the monarchist cause.

Its slogan, \"From Colony to Province\", summarises its fight alongside integralist principles: assimilation within a greater France, while still retaining privileges, traditions and local laws against the centralisation and disregard for indigenous customs of the Republic. Demanding native autonomy in social and economic regulation, universal suffrage in municipal elections, and for native notables to constitute an assembly advising the French government, Abbas has quickly found resonance among natives, particularly the assimilated elites and the influential indigenous chiefs, eager to defend their way of life against an ever-encroaching republican government.\n\nHowever, the localist proposals of the Action is not the only thing that has found resonance among natives: its antisemitic rhetoric is also proving popular. Legacy of the Crémieux Decree, a law that granted full French citizenship to the Jewish population of French Algeria but not to the Arab and Berber Muslim population, who remain to this day essentially second-class citizens, this wedge between communities that had lived together in relative peace for centuries has proven easy to exploit for the far right, as some groups and parties even promise to repeal the decree to gain support from natives, either out of genuine ideological convergence or simply out of pragmatism, as they know that nothing could be achieved without the support, or at least the neutrality, of the indigènes."

Born in a staunchly republican family, he turned to monarchism not out of nostalgia, but out of reflection and comparison, considering the Republic to be unstable, fickle, and fundamentally incapable to compete with a stable and united Germany. A prolific writer, he ceaselessly exalted the French monarchy in his historical works and contributed to many newspapers, simultaneously literary critic and financial analyst. Fleeing to Algeria as the revolution broke out, he wrote in the chaotic aftermath a short book that quickly became immensely popular. Titled \"The Political Consequences of Peace\", Bainvillle exposes his thoughts on the peace treaty between the CGT and the Germans, stating that just like the Republic is the daughter of Bismarck, engineered to weaken France, the Commune is the daughter of Wilhelm II, created to rot France down to her very roots so that she might eventually be turned into little more than a vassal state in an inevitable coming war.\n\nThis thesis has become one of the pillars of the rhetoric of the AF, who tirelessly advocates for the fall of one daughter of the Boche so that France might be able to take on the other. Many in our nation are sensible to this kind of talk as anti-German sentiment has certainly not subsided one bit among exiles, and Bainville’s funeral procession was followed by thousands of mourners, with political companions, fellow writers and academicians and even members of the government attending his funeral mass. The Lion of Verdun himself put out a statement honouring the life and works of the historian now seen as a prophet by many."

The first cathedral to be consecrated in the Sahel, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception takes inspiration from both traditional African building techniques and Romanesque architecture. It stands as a powerful symbol of the success of missionary work within the French colonial empire and especially that of the Pères Blancs. It is also the crowning personal achievement of Monsignor Thénévoud, whose presence in the city has made an unrivalled impact. Arriving in the city in 1903, he immediately reached out to the local Mossi chiefs and got to work building schools, a seminary, developing the land, and implementing industry, slowly but surely making the mission the economic heart of the city, if not the whole region. Two years after his arrival, there were already more than a thousand catechumens under his supervision: the number of converts has grown exponentially since.\n\nAs for the rumours that he is the true governor of the colony, it is undeniable that through his personal charisma, experience, diplomatic skills and growing economic influence, Monsignor Thénévoud wields considerable influence, often acting as an intermediary between the colonial administration and traditional power structures. He has been an important and outspoken part of the administrative council of Haute-Volta for more than a decade now and was a severe critic of the Algiers regime's handling of the famines of the early 1930s and the revolts that followed. However, the apostolic vicar has always dismissed claims that true power in Haute-Volta lies with him, presenting himself as nothing more than a humble missionary blessed with some success, caring for his flock."

Rejecting both reaction and liberalism, secularism and intransigent political Catholicism, embracing humanism, arguing for human rights, the importance of family, pluralistic democracy and responsibility toward the common good, all in the spirit of the social teachings of the Church, the philosopher is somewhat going against the grain. Indeed, much of the French Catholic laity and hierarchy has been radicalised by the current situation: the AF has even denounced \"Integral Humanism\" as the work of a traitor, a sell-out to \"democratism\", a red saboteur. However among more progressive Catholics Maritain’s work was very well received, getting praise from Father Montini, a close advisor of the pope, and with some moderates even being drawn away from the Action Française, heeding his warning that the movement is merely using the Faith as a tool to further their political ideology."

Born into an aristocratic family, he lived a dissolute life, eventually becoming a cavalry officer. This experience spurred him to leave his old life behind: he decided to take the vows, attracted by an ascetic life of poverty among the Tuaregs with whom he formed deep bonds, learning their language, translating the Scriptures, and preaching through example. Seen as a saintly man by natives, authorities and the Church’s hierarchy, a tragic end awaited him: caught in the conflict with the Senussi, he was martyred on the 1st of December 1916.\n\nDesert hermit, saintly martyr, pioneer of French influence in the most remote corners of the empire, Father Charles became a national icon, his total abandonment to God and asceticism inspiring many Catholics, leading some to rethink their positions on native populations and Islam as a whole. His recent beatification has even led the Academy of Colonial Sciences to petition the papacy so that he be made patron saint of colonisation: the regime, however, hasn’t waited for him to be officially recognised as such, and prominently uses him as a propaganda piece, despite de Foucauld’s frequent criticism of colonial attitudes."

The crowd dispersed, and four laid dead. Ever since this grim day, it has been commemorated by the Maltese. As the British revolution came to a close in 1926, local authorities became increasingly nervous for the future of Malta, with mutiny, nationalist and socialist agitation, or occupation by another power seeming like increasingly real threats: the Germans being already in the process of seizing much of the empire would certainly not pass up an opportunity to spread their influence to the Mittelmeer. As such, the governor, Sir Walter Norris Congreve, called on us to secure the islands for the Entente, and French marine infantry obliged. Malta was granted much autonomy in dealing with day to day matters, officially still part of the British Empire but by now effectively a French protectorate, a state of affairs acceptable to both the small British elite content with maintaining their power and nationalists now enjoying something approaching home rule. As such, the Sette Giugno was made an official holiday of remembrance and hope for unity. Though no longer the headquarter of the Mediterranean fleet, the island is still the lock of the Strait of the Sicily, the bastion assuring Entente dominance over the Western Mediterranean: a large garrison is maintained on the island and much was invested to expand the defences and ports of the islands, reflecting its critical role in our naval strategy."

As such it has become a focal point for the Mediterranean strategy of the Entente, having quickly been transformed into a major naval and airbase from which our ships patrol as close as possible to the mainland, with tense face-offs with Internationale ships occurring every other week.\n\nAny liberation effort would have to start here, and much of the intelligence and reconnaissance work done in France and Italy is coordinated from Bastia and Ajaccio. It is also there that the first waves of exiles landed, and though most moved on to Algeria, many stayed, creating a population and economic boost that paired with the military build-up has revitalised the island, despite perpetual tension as war looms. Though there is no longer a stream of refugees like in the early days of the Commune, there is still a constant trickle of dissidents making their way to our shores, each given a hero’s welcome but carefully interrogated. Finally, organised crime, already an issue before the war, has become a mainstay of island life. Many destitute veterans and refugees turned to crime, the presence of so many soldiers made gambling and prostitution booming businesses, and the Corsican mafia under the leadership of men like Paul \"the Emperor\" Carbone, himself a veteran, further thrived on the smuggling of goods and people in and out of the métropole. The authorities, however, turn a blind eye to this, as the mafia has proved to be an incredibly useful network of informants within the Commune, all the while attending to the baser needs of infantrymen and officers alike."

Appointed by the colonial authorities first as imam then as a mufti, unpopular and frequently brazenly critical of even mild reformist talk, Bendali had many powerful enemies. After a rough interrogation session, the murderer confessed to being merely a pawn in a greater scheme, offered thousands of francs to kill the imam by the true mastermind behind the crime: a prominent member of the reformist Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, Tayeb el-Okbi. Already banned from preaching in mosques by colonial authorities, the man had been under police surveillance for some time, suspected of conspiring against the state under the pretence of religious reform: he was immediately arrested and is awaiting trial.\n\nHowever, many Algerians and some Frenchmen believe this is a conspiracy, and that el-Okbi was falsely implicated in this affair by colonial police eager to have such an inconvenience disappear. Whether that accusation is true or not, this case is quickly turning into an embarrassment.

Through the touching story of a young priest in a small village in northern France, Bernanos tackles themes such as spirituality, death, the battle between Good and Evil, destiny, the role of the Church under an anticlerical regime, but also selflessness, hope, salvation and grace. Struggling with a lack of authority, with a lack of funds, with the growing impiety of his flock, and with local authorities oscillating between derisive mockery and outright hostility, the parish priest puts extreme zeal and selflessness into attempting to save the souls of his parishioners, sometimes falling into despair but never giving up his fight, a fight perhaps lost in advance but a fight bringing him closer to God. Culminating with the conversion of the chairman of the local council, the book ends on a bittersweet note, the young curé himself dying shortly after of stomach cancer, softly uttering \"All is Grace\".\n\nA monarchist, but praising the spirit of revolt of 1789, violently opposed to syndicalism but just as violently opposed to the bourgeoisie, close to the Action Française but often conflicting with their views, profoundly Catholic, but criticising clergy more concerned with order than salvation, considering himself neither right nor left-wing, but simply Christian, George Bernanos is a man full of contradiction. Nevertheless, with this \"Diary\", a work full of his sincere faith and spirituality, he has touched the whole nation, if not the whole Catholic world."

After numerous production delays and a harsh reception by critics, the commercial success of this thrilling tale of espionage is a surprise. Telling the story of captain Benoit, played by Jean Murat, sent on a mission by the Second Bureau, our elusive military intelligence agency, to seize the blueprints of the latest red weapon in the very heart of the Commune, this movie has it all: action, suspense, and of course, romance. Of course, the handsome captain is eventually noticed by Communard counter-intelligence, who sends their best agent after him: Elise, true femme fatale, tasked with seducing the agent. Of course the two fall in love, and plan on escaping together: as the Communards realise this, she sacrifices herself and dies in her lover’s arms, forcefully reminded of his duty to France.\n\nCritics hated it, calling it cheap entertainment, and yet, the public loved it, and asked for more, dismissing rumours that the film received state funding to transform the public image of the secretive and sometimes sinister agency as mere Communard propaganda."

His exploits are told like epic tales in newspapers and newsreels, and he has become something of a national hero, even getting involved in politics with Colonel de La Rocque’s PSF and advocating for the development of air travel. But a few days ago, on his twenty-fifth cross-Atlantic flight the aviator disappeared.

 nfa.417.d:0 "\"Pépé le Moko\", a melodrama starring rising actor Jean Gabin and the already famous Mireille Balin has quickly found great success at home and even abroad. Set in Algiers, particularly in the labyrinthic and exotic old town, the Casbah, the movie tells the story of Pépé, played by Gabin, a former big shot in the Parisian underworld now in hiding, and the men trying to catch him, both law enforcement and syndicalist agents looking to put down once and for all a major organiser of the black market within the Commune. Settling in comfortable exile, rebuilding a criminal empire, the gangster is soon thrown off balance by the arrival of Gaby, played by Balin, mistress of a prominent businessman looking to \"slum it\" among natives and emigrants in the sensual and dangerous world of the Casbah. The two strike up a relationship, igniting the jealousy of Pépé’s mistress. This love triangle is followed with great interest by the police, who use the two women to slowly push the gangster to take more and more risks and eventually leave hiding. Surrounded, knowing his doom is a matter of time, facing an eternity in prison or assassination by red agents, Pépé instead decides to go out on his terms, committing suicide as he spots Gaby in the distance.\n\nA gripping, suspenseful tale of love and treason, with its tear-jerking ending, shot entirely on location, it’s hardly surprising that the movie has found such tremendous success, some seeing it as an instant classic. And Pépé, quintessential anti-hero, criminal but principled, has become a bit of a youth icon as many identify with his situation at the crossroad of two worlds, French and native, as well as with his melancholic longing for Paris."

Hundreds of troops have been created since, proving popular among all classes as many young boys and teenagers flock to them, drawn by promises of adventure, a sense of belonging, as well as dashing uniforms with red and green bandanas. Drawing from Lord Baden-Powell’s books, the boys learn how to camp and survive, sing songs, participate in religious ceremonies like Eid or Mawlid, where they parade in uniform, the groups even organising mass Khitan, circumcision of boys around seven years old, an occasion of much celebration that poor families could otherwise not afford. However, these groups have remained largely isolated from each other, merely sharing values, a flag, and a uniform. As such, representatives from the various troops have asked the colonial administration its blessing to create a Federation of Algerian Muslim Scouts that would permit greater cooperation and standardisation of scouting practices among the indigènes. Already, prominent native voices like Ferhat Abbas and a diverse coalition of French reformists campaign for the official approval of such a federation, arguing that it would promote traditional values along with loyalty to France, while some more conservative pieds-noirs argue that the boy scouts are groomed for a red-green jihad by the syndicalist agents of Messali Hadj, that native scouting is a bad idea altogether, and that the patrie they are loyal to is not France, but Algeria. More pragmatic voices in government argue that giving our approval to this federation would grant us much greater oversight over a largely autonomous initiative."

In these trying times, it’s hardly surprising that the peoples of Europe and beyond are prone to melancholy, however, rumours have been circulating about the song: that it is linked with an ever-increasing number of suicides, in France, the United States, and the composer’s homeland, Hungary, and that merely listening to the tune could push even the cheeriest individual towards suicidal ideation. Whether this is a fact, a mere urban rumour, or a clever marketing campaign, the song has already been banned from airing on the radio or even being sung publicly in more than a few countries, which only adds to the credibility of rumours about the now-infamous \"Hungarian suicide song\".\n\nHere too, a debate has raged on the question of a potential ban, an almost welcome break from the usual political fracas.

And indeed each year the patriotic celebrations organised around the shrine built for the relic are more and more popular, with tens of thousands in attendance for a day culminating in an open-air mass, including numerous parliamentarians, officials, bishops, intellectuals, veterans, and officers, and this year even [NFA.GetLeader] himself.\n\nHowever despite the association claiming that it seeks to remain apolitical, and the \"Pucelle\" being revered by most of the political spectrum, many seek to use the event to further their political agenda.

However, he had largely steered clear off politics, his post as diplomat demanding strict reserve on these matters. The crisis unfolding in Spain has however changed this attitude and prompted him into action, particularly emerging tales of red terror, profanations, and acts of syndicalist violence against Catholic clergy and laity, all ringing eerily familiar to the exiles. Claudel has pleaded with the government to provide unconditional support for the Spanish royalists that he believes are engaged in a holy war against the forces of evil. Committees of support towards this cause have already begun to appear, raising funds, organising volunteers, and engaging in what can only be described as propaganda effort on behalf of the Kingdom of Spain with often tacit support from the Catholic hierarchy. The poem, \"Aux Martyrs Espagnols\" calls on the reader to stand up against the red Neros and Diocletians, lists reported acts of persecution, and exalts a holy Spain that will be reborn through the blood of the martyrs: it has by now appeared on leaflets, mocked for its rather emotional and verbose prose, endlessly quoted by supporters of the Spanish kingdom, and been quickly translated and spread through much of the Catholic world, Paul Claudel becoming a sort of figurehead of the Spanish cause."

Slowly, indigènes clubs formed, the first being Algiers Mouloudia Club in 1921, and these days football has become an incredibly popular pastime for many of our citizens, with children playing in every street, stadiums being built, and solid fanbases consolidating around clubs that pop up in every neighbourhood. Regrouped into departmental leagues, these amateur clubs participate in a year-long competition, the best eventually competing in the North African Football Cup with clubs from Algeria, Tunisia, and even Morocco. These matches draw huge crowds, the occasion to play out in a most friendly manner rivalry between nations, regions, and between colonists and natives. This latter phenomenon has increasingly worried authorities, who want to avoid at all costs that Muslim clubs begin incarnating any kind of contestation of colonial order: however, banning these clubs would simply be making martyrs of them, and so instead the government has opted for a policy of integration, pressuring clubs to field both natives and colonists. A policy that has proved unpopular on both sides but slowly seems to be bearing fruits.\n\nThis year, the North Africa cup final was played between the Algiers University Racing and Algiers Gallia Sport, with the university club winning 2-0 after a tense match and goals narrowly avoided by the club’s goalkeeper, a young man named Albert Camus."

Set in a German prison camp during the Great War, the movie follows three French officers, one of working-class background, an aristocrat, and a nouveau riche naturalised Polish Jew and their efforts to escape captivity. Their plots foiled multiple times, the men never lose hope, promising each other to meet in Paris once the war is won. The officers cautiously fraternise with their German jailer, but never lose sight of their goal, and the aristocrat sacrifices himself to allow his companions to escape. Travelling through the German countryside, eventually being sheltered by a widow, one falls in love. However, his sense of duty forces him to continue his journey back to France, and the officers are finally able to rejoin the fight. The end, however, is ambiguous: a final shot shows an empty table of a Parisian restaurant, as heavy fighting seems to take place outside, leaving the fate of the men unknown.\n\nThe movie, tackling a wide variety of themes such as class, prejudice, patriotism and duty with phenomenal actors and humour, has been a hit. However, its humanistic approach, showcasing sympathetic German characters, as well as characters who consider the war ultimately futile has been hotly debated, with many accusing the movie of pacifism. Abroad the reception has been mixed, as the movie was heavily censored in Germany, dismissed as reactionary propaganda in the Commune for its themes of class collaboration and showcase of the aristocracy as laudable tragic figures, but praised in the United States, even being shown in the White House. In any case, it has become an instant classic."

Staying neutral in 1914, the principality eventually found itself in a difficult situation, with the civil war in France and revolution brewing in Italy. As communard militias were closing in on the Rock, symbol of rampant capitalism under which the bourgeoisie gambled away the produce of the proletariat’s hard work, Albert I chose exile, taking with him the fabulous riches of the Grimaldi family and setting up a court in exile, before being succeeded by his son in 1922. Louis II had served as an officer in the Foreign Legion, fighting at the Marne and the Chemin des Dames, earning himself the nickname of \"Soldier-Prince\" and a promotion to the rank of general. Since his coronation, Louis has been desperately fighting for his unilaterally annexed principality. He has found some success, extracting recognition of his government-in-exile from countries opposed to the Commune. An admirer of Marshal Pétain, the Prince has furthermore been funding various right and far-right initiatives, steering clear however of the Action Française, which had run a vicious press campaign against the principality during the Great War, Monaco being smeared as a den of German spies and Jewish capital.\n\nBut today is a joyous occasion, as the tiny Monégasque community in exile celebrates Sovereign's Day, Monaco’s national day falling on the Prince’s patron saint’s feast. A lavish party has been organised, with many of France’s political elites and numerous foreign diplomats being assembled in the prince’s palace on the outskirts of Algiers, an occasion he will no doubt use to further his cause."

Born in a royalist family but rallied to the Republic, he turned down a military career opportunity. Instead, he dedicated his life to pedagogy and sports, himself a proficient athlete, promoting physical activity integration into education. However, de Coubertin had an even greater objective: popularise sports by internationalising them and making them an instrument of peace and greater understanding between the peoples through peaceful competition and sportsmanship. Hoping to further this utopian goal, de Coubertin turned to Ancient Greece and her Panhellenic games. The first Olympics in almost two millennia took place in 1894 in Athens.\n\nBut even the reborn Olympics could not prevent the madness of the Great War. Following the revolution, the baron had to flee to Algeria like so many others. Pierre de Coubertin was heartbroken by the death at the front of two of his nephews and the diplomatic blunder of the 1924 Berlin Olympics that neither of the Frances attended. He was forced to watch as his dream crumbled before his eyes. As the socialist powers grew in prominence, the Socialist Worker's Sport International began to draw away the dignity that he built the Olympics to be. Intended to be a contest of the nations' finest athletes, the socialists soured the games by basing them along mass participation rather than athletic heroism. Following the announcement of his death, the government nonetheless put out a statement praising him, and the Greek government has announced its intention to build a monument honouring the baron in Olympia."

Winemaking has historically been one of the engines of French colonisation of the region, promoting the development of much land and infrastructure, quickly becoming the go-to enterprise for prospective colonists of relatively little means and the principal source of income of the colony. Since the exile, business has of course been booming: viticulturists can barely keep up with the demand, as hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen each year consume bottle after bottle, and legal importation of wine from the métropole is of course impossible. Though Algerian vintage is still considered of somewhat lower quality by much of our French population, that remembers fondly wine from Bordeaux or Bourgogne, it is slowly gaining some prestige, thanks to the hard work of exiles aiming to bring production up to the standards of the motherland: perhaps one day these wines will be as renowned as those of the métropole."

He chronicles the slow descent of the working classes in indignity over the last century and a half, caused by usurious industrial capitalism and new illegitimate elites, culminating in the 1919 revolution, an event that he considers engineered by nefarious forces exploiting the legitimate grievances of the masses. Prince Henri then makes a passionate case for the monarchy, the only regime he claims could truly restore the dignity of the people by upholding tradition and the Social Doctrine of the Church.\n\nThe work was well-received and sold well, thanks to tireless promotion by the Action Française and praise by influential clergy, already being translated in multiple languages and published abroad, though some were shocked by the violence of Henri’s denunciation of capitalism and the bourgeoisie.

Indeed, Hazoumé aims to accurately depict life before European colonisation \"to facilitate the understanding of the Black mind by the coloniser\", proving along the way that Dahomeans and Africans in general are not so different from \"civilised\" people and that they too have a long and rich history worthy of being studied.\n\nBorn into an aristocratic family in 1890 in Porto-Novo, Hazoumé is himself Dahomean. Educated in a Catholic mission, then moving to Sénégal to further his studies, Hazoumé wrote in local newspapers, sharing a generally pro-French sentiment but never shying away from criticism of the excesses of the colonial administration. As Dahomey was ceded to Germany, he started a teaching career while writing articles published in both French and German territory. Earning himself the respect of his European colleagues and a job at the Museum of Man, Paul Hazoumé has now reached new heights by becoming the first African man to earn such a distinction.

The song lists all the characteristics of a group of soldiers and officers: all coming from different walks of life, all in different occupations, many middle-aged and with families of their own, of differing faiths, races, and political opinions, all with their own little ailments, and yet, as the chorus states, \"all of them make excellent Frenchmen, excellent soldiers.\"\n\nCatchy and comedic, it’s the song’s underlying call for unity as our nation is faced with its greatest struggle yet and its exaltation of the French infantryman, always ready to leave everything behind and forget himself in the fight to defend his motherland that has made its immense success. In a nation where everything is mobilised for the coming war effort like ours, each and every one of us can identify with this sentiment: we will fight, and we will win because we must retake our home!"

This measure was necessary to coordinate the various actions taken by opponents to the syndicalist regime such as the distribution of tracts, preparations to hamper the war effort, recruitment, bribery, or discrete weapon training as tensions ramp up a bit more each day. Though the resistance is still far from being able to rise as one against the Communards, establishing this radio station will go a long way towards making sure the efforts of our brothers will not be in vain: once we land on our shores, they will be ready to do all they can to free France."

Furthermore, with Guénon's conversion to Sufism many of these Masons and other types are increasingly interested in the native Sufi Tariqas or Orders. With the AF now in power, this relationship is increasingly troubling, with some proclaiming it the return of Gnosticism and Quietism, both of which are excommunicated heresies.

This occultist milieu produced various New Religious and Philosophical Currents claiming ancient lineages and hidden knowledge, supposedly handed down by cabals of Masons, Magicians and Alchemists. From this milieu emerged the first academic studies of Oriental Religions and Metaphysical Systems. However, following the defeat, this nascent community of Occultists and Orientalists has broken in two, with violent embrace or rejection of the new socialist regime. René Guénon is firmly in the camp of anti-Syndicalists, having followed the government in exile, written anti-Materialist tracts and published "The Crisis of the Modern World" in which he rejects the concept of progress in favour of Hindu Cyclical Time. However he is equally highly controversial even within the far right, arguing in favour of Ultramontanism, on the basis of the supremacy of the Brahmin over the Kshatriya, and having recently converted to Sufi Islam and exited his Masonic Lodge. His most recent book, \"Oriental Metaphysics\" is a detailed exploration of Oriental Metaphysical Systems, drawing links between Catholicism and Eastern religions as sharing a primordial tradition. It has been embraced by certain parts of the Far Right who see these systems as a way to escape the Liberal worldview of their recent past in favour of a Traditionalist system free of the evils of Progress. Others however have rejected it violently seeing this as the resurrection of Gnosticism within the Christian Vanguard, with some wishing it to be banned. The book has caused significant controversy and lively debate, particularly between Guénon and Catholic neo-thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain, getting a surprising amount of success with even relatively mainstream audiences. Calls for a ban of the book have arisen from clergy and conservative Catholics, while others argue that it could be helpful in evangelisation, or control, of the natives."

Our current exile has led many, particularly academics and clergymen, to seek a better understanding of the faith of so many of our countrymen. Some out of genuine interest or hope of interfaith dialogue, while others dream of large-scale conversion of the indigènes to Christianity. A recent open letter published anonymously in \"En Terre d’Islam\" is threatening the fragile religious equilibrium, however. The letter, calling for the formation of a \"Friday Prayer League for the Conversion of the Muslims\" to \"pray for our estranged brothers\" was well received within Catholic circles and would have likely not reached Muslim audiences if not for the identity of its author, leaked to the wider press in the following days: Father Jean-Mohamed Ben Abdejlil.\n\nThe man was recently ordained to the priesthood, becoming a professor at the Catholic Institute of Algiers last year. And yet, ten years ago, he was its first Muslim student. Coming from a prominent Morrocan family, a brilliant youth, fervent in his faith, he came under the protection of Marshal Lyautey, who encouraged him to further his studies in Algiers. There, he met famed orientalist Louis Massignon and Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain. He had joined hoping to \"study the enemy\". A year later he would convert, two years and he joined the Franciscan Order. This high profile conversion had largely been swept under the rug due to fears of unrest, apostasy being a particularly severe act in Islam: such fears have been confirmed. The letter, translated and mistranslated, was widely shared in mosques and madrassas, and was overwhelmingly received with contempt, if not anger, with even threats being directed towards Father Jean-Mohamed, who has gone into hiding."

As the crowds grew however, a cursory investigation was initiated by our intelligence services. Shockingly, they found that this \"François-Henry Prométhée\" has never existed, and is merely the pseudonym of Maurice Delaunay, a farmer from Normandy, who after brilliant studies at the National Institute for Horticulture and a brief stint in politics has seemingly lost his mind.

Put it simply, they aim to do nothing less than destroy French culture. In their manifesto is professed a need to abolish the canons of French literature and poetry as well as radically transform the rules of French grammar, decried as antiquated and bourgeois.\n\nTo protest this crime against taste, culture, beauty, and, frankly, civilisation itself, the men of the various académies of the Institute of France have assembled in a common congress to produce a counter-manifesto. All clad in their green-trimmed formal attire, complete with personalised ornate swords and bicornes, the 473 members of the Institute have signed a common appeal to the world to undermine the efforts of these 'perverts' and 'bohemians', and penned a manifesto in which they call for the creation of an international 'Institute of Occident' to fight the 'vanguard of inculture'. This initiative has received wide acclaim in France and among our Entente allies, as well as from the German sphere.\n\nAs for the International Avant-Garde, it responded by setting up an abstract statue representing 'bourgeois culture' and 'classicism' made out of copies of the manifesto in front of the former location of the Institut de France, in Paris.

Under the unofficial leadership of Abdelhamid Ben Badis, this association of theologians, teachers and more generally learned men has come to promote Islamic reform, hoping to bring Islam in Algeria to its pure original form, away from the superstitions fostered by the marabouts and the more mystical approach of the Sufi congregations. Taking inspiration from similar initiatives which found success in the Middle East and Tunisia, many schools have already been created, teaching grammar, mathematics and religion to children, and theology, philosophy, history as well as Islamic and French law to young adults, quickly becoming a major influence in mosques all over the region and attracting the suspicion of colonial authorities.\n\nIndeed, one of the stated goals of the Association is to foster the Islamic identity of Algeria, to unite the people beyond the divide between Berbers and coastal arabophone Algerians and beyond tribal boundaries. Though they stop short of advocating for independence, they strongly oppose assimilation, claiming that an Algerian nation does exist, which could not become French and does not want to be French. As such they have already found themselves becoming an important player in the politics of the Algerian departments. First, authorities unsuccessfully sought to co-opt the association, much like the rest of the Islamic clergy in the colonies, as banning the already powerful group would certainly create unrest. Then, two native groups came to seek the support of the ulema: the Action Algérienne of Ferhat Abbas, which claims that should the Action Française come to power an autonomous Algerian identity could be fostered and traditional and Islamic law could be fully restored, and the Étoile Nord-Africaine of Messali Hadj, a syndicalist-aligned underground group which advocates for the independence of Algeria with the support of the Commune. So far, the Association has not sided with either, sceptical of both the sincerity of the AF’s promises of autonomy and the anticlerical socialism advocated by the Communards."

Some dare to whisper that the Comité is merely a front for a renewed dictatorship under Mordacq, and already some intellectuals and politicians openly criticise the General.

Finally free from censorship, it seems journalists are relishing in this effort to tear down the man who restored freedom of expression. The government has so far ignored the situation, but letting this criticism go unanswered much longer could durably undermine the new regime and jeopardise our efforts to save the nation. Of course restoring censorship would be unthinkable, but there exist legal means to stifle this flow of defamation.

Invoking the 1881 Law on the Freedom of the Press, they were accused of inciting 'offences against the public interest', and were put on trial.\n\nThis, however, backfired. Not only this made the Comité de Salut National look tyrannical, and made the criticism look founded, but it was utterly ineffective. The trials were turned into platforms for these men to criticise the new political order, arguing that it was at best another flavour of tyranny, and that this effort to stifle their right to freedom of expression went against the very ideals that led them to fight against the Pétain regime.

It took a particularly brave foreign journalist to ask the one question on everyone’s mind: 'General, will you uphold the fundamental liberties of Frenchmen?'\n\nAnd finally, Mordacq spoke. 'It is true that we live in extraordinary times, and as such extraordinary measures are necessary. This is no longer the time for discussion but the time of action, and action, true action, action that produces results, requires a single will. We must unite if we want to win, and we must win for the salvation of France.

In 1848, when the Second Republic was established and universal suffrage was declared, women were excluded from such universality.

Though there were sympathies among more progressive republicans for the cause of women’s suffrage, they still considered that the vote of women would be used against the fragile republic. Furthermore, the Parti Radical, dominating French politics, and well known for its deep anti-clericalism, doubted the independence of women from the Church, a concern that was exacerbated in the years since the exile, as pope Benedict XV gave support for women’s suffrage in 1919: the republic then at its most vulnerable could not afford the risk of women voting along either their husband’s will, or worse, the Church’s.\n\nCharles Maurras has long defended in Action Française the right of women to vote: indeed, they had that right in France for centuries before the revolution, being called to vote in parish, communal or even regional assemblies and participating as equals in urban assemblies if they were widowed, for example. And as the Church has officially taken a position on the matter, now that we have finally freed France from the grasps of the Gueuse, it is our duty to right the wrongs committed by the republicans. As such, a royal decree has been published declaring that from now on, women would have the right and duty to participate in politics."

But now freed from the republican shackles, France shall no longer be represented by a mere peasant, no longer is our people drinking the rotten milk from the diseased republican teat: busts in town halls have been taken down, statues brought down and destroyed by cheering Camelots. Instead, we will build symbols of the true France, such as statues of King Saint Louis and Saint Jeanne d’Arc, or representations of the royal lilies and the Gallic rooster. As for the official personification of our nation, we simply have to look to the past for inspiration. France had traditionally been represented as a woman in a blue cloak with golden fleurs de lys, armed or brandishing the royal hand of justice, often wearing a golden crown or a helmet, sometimes armoured: a much more fitting symbol for the reborn Kingdom."

The Republic could not afford to alienate either side, and as such never gave an official explanation. Either way, this celebration of either revolutionary bloodshed or constitutional monarchy is wildly inadequate for the restored regime.\n\nFrance did not have an official national day prior to the revolution, and as such three propositions have brought before the king. The feast day of Saint Louis, king of France, on the 25th of August had been the occasion for popular celebrations in honour of the king, and is the closest the Ancien Régime had to a National Day. However, since 1922 two saints have been declared by the papacy to be the primary patron saints of France: Our Lady on her Assumption, the 15th of August, as she has been traditionally considered Regina Galliae, Queen of France, and Saint Joan of Arc, sent by God to free France, her feast day falling on the 30th of May, when her martyrdom took place.

The republican regime immediately got to work to thoroughly destroy France from the inside, gutting her traditions, cutting her off from the Faith and turning the Elder Daughter of the Church into the Gueuse, intent on spreading atheism, terror and destruction the world over. Those who bravely stood against this parasitic beast were mercilessly crushed, and hundreds of thousands of innocents were martyred on the altar of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. Though the Republic eventually fell thanks to the machinations of the impostor Bonaparte, the seeds the revolution planted continued to plague France until far too recently.\n\nAs such, King Jean III has decreed that a week of mourning in commemoration of the victims of the revolution would take place, with daily masses and processions to expiate the sins committed by our people not so long ago. However, this week, celebrations will be organised all over our territories to celebrate the counter-revolution and recent restoration of the rightful monarchy, as well our hope to soon extinguish another revolution."

Though a part of the population had initially welcomed the annexation, it quickly became clear that without independence, gambling or tourism, the former principality was little more than a backwards if pretty little town and opinion towards the Communards quickly soured. A treaty was signed later in the day with French representatives, deepening the mutual commitment of the two states towards each other already established by the 1918 treaty of 'protective friendship', and ensuring that the fate of France and Monaco would from now on forever be linked."

Instead, his tutor made him promise at a young age to never serve the French, setting him on a course of tireless work for his people. He studied at the Ez-Zituna madrasa in Tunis, the oldest and one of the most prestigious centres of Islamic learning in all of the Maghreb, and it is there and during extended stays in the Middle East that he came to embrace a strongly reformist current of Islam, coming home with the hope of rooting out the unorthodox practices of the marabouts and sufis in his homeland and strengthening the Islamic identity of Algeria. One of the founding members of Association of Algerian Muslim Ulema, he quickly became its unofficial head, helping to create many schools all over the region, advocating against assimilation and greatly participating in the struggle for the rights of the indigènes, particularly in his lifelong home, Constantine, the \"City of Bridges\". As the Algerians mourn the death of a scholar and patriot, the pieds-noirs breathe a sigh of relief, as they always considered him a thorn in their side. As for the authorities, though they sent official condolences to the family of Ben Badis, some are wary of the consequences of his passing: after all, the man was rather moderate and always made sure the ulema always strayed clear of any kind of independentist talk."

But we have finally been contacted by its leader, Alsatian textile industrialist Paul Dungler, nicknamed Commandant Martial, a citizen of the Reich. With German cash, given under the pretences of funding study of the Genisteae flower in the hills of the Vosges region, Commandant Martial quickly built a disciplined network gathering information on Communard infrastructure and troop movements in the East, implementing weapons and explosives caches all over the Vosges and in Alsace, creating armed networks in Lorraine as well as stay-behind groups should the Commune advance past the Vosges. However, unbeknown to his German patrons, Dungler believes that Alsace is a rightful part of France and his network has been gathering an immense wealth of information from within the German intelligence framework as well as cultivating links within the armies of the Reich of disgruntled Alsatian soldiers and officers.\n\nHe has now offered us his services as a double agent, giving us access to his network to prepare the liberation of France, and we would be foolish to refuse.

Despite these conciliatory words, for close to two decades they enviously observed as we spread French civilisation and built a globe-spanning empire. More than once, we rebuked their attempts at expansion: they made us pay this dearly. Utterly defeated in Africa, their subjects breathing a sigh of relief as the Teuton yoke was finally lifted, we were nevertheless forced to concede to Germany much of our colonies as part of the conditions of the 1919 Armistice. We had hoped that this would be a temporary measure, that renegotiations could help us get more favourable terms: the revolution swiftly ended those hopes. Exiled to Algeria, we could only watch in horror as the Germans annexed our possessions and those of Belgium, then taking over the colonies of our British allies when they too fell to socialism. The Kaiserreich created a monster, an incomprehensible, colossal patchwork of previous administrations and renegotiated treaties stretching from Abidjan to Dar-es-Salaam.\n\nBut we have finally been vindicated. The Kaiser having appointed his protégé von Göring as head of the chimeric \"Deutsch-Mittelafrika\", the overambitious Flying Ogre only managed to catastrophically lead the colonies: under the crushing weight of his incompetence, the fragile construct collapsed. Much of Africa is now in a state that could only be described as anarchic, as European colonists struggle for dominance or for survival, depending on their location. Some within our administration argue that this is a perfect time to march south and reconquer what is ours, but it is simply too early: the Germans still claim that the situation will soon be under control, and we cannot afford to antagonise them before the mainland is reconquered.

The King promptly accepted, and his court cheered.\n\nThis seemingly spontaneous display of royal power was however the result of weeks of negotiations between French representatives and King Agoli-Agbo. With the collapse of German African order, many native leaders have suddenly been thrust into positions of actual leadership for the first time in decades: some, like Agoli-Agbo, have managed to somewhat reassert their traditional authorities over their people. However Dahomey is still in disarray: German remnants still lurk and the King simply lacks the resources to truly reestablish order over the territory of the whole former colony, particularly over the northern peoples such as the fierce Bariba and their wassangari horsemen, vastly different from his own Fon people. As such, Agoli-Agbo needed allies: as his former masters, we were his first and perhaps only choice. We must recognise however that he smartly used our tense relationship with Germany in these negotiations: we could not simply march our way down to the Gulf of Guinea as the Kaiser still claims dominion over the region and so we must settle on an unofficial protectorate, surrounding the King with advisors and shoring up his hold on the country with our resources.

With strict discipline, exemplary morality, strenuous physical exercise inspired by scoutism and military training, long hours of study and a deep sense of camaraderie, Lieutenant Dunoyer de Segonzac hopes to create a New Man entirely dedicated to national interests.

 nfa.534.d:0 "The sleepy little village of Vimoutiers in Normandie, whose only claim to fame was its tenuous assertion to be the birthplace of the famous Camembert cheese, was heavily damaged in the recent fighting, particularly after retreating Red British troops attempted to create a temporary stronghold. Much like in so many cities and villages across France, it will take years to rebuild. However, one heap of slowly rusting metal is turning into a playground for local children and attracting the curiosity of a few onlookers: a disabled heavy British tank in particularly good shape, once a lynchpin of the local Syndicalist defence, stuck in a ditch right outside Vimoutiers.\n\nOf course, the authorities attempted to seize the tank as part of the country-wide effort to heal the scars of the war, either to scrap it for parts and metal or study it further. But the Vimonastériens refused, even chasing away one cleanup crew: children cried at the thought of losing their playground, while the adults had grown strangely attached to the wreck. Of course the near pristine state of the tank has spurned numerous jokes about the bravery of the British troops but mostly the locals seem fascinated by the object, its newfound peaceful quietness perhaps a symbol of the slow return to normalcy across France. In any case, the local mayor said he intends to turn the tank into a monument. What should be done?"

 nfa.535.d:0 "Following the meeting of Prince Henri with His Holiness, the Prince has embarked on a campaign to honour the memory of the Pontifical Zouaves, a regiment of pious mostly French volunteers who defended the Papal States until the conquest of Rome by the Kingdom of Italy in 1870. Following the fall of the Eternal City, these volunteers immediately headed to France to fight bravely in the Franco-Prussian War. These devout Catholics, many of them royalists, headed by Baron Athanase de Charette de La Contrie, descendant of a famous leader of the Vendée insurrection, nevertheless set aside their differences with the Republic to fight against the Prussian aggressor. Despite the defeat, they captivated French Catholic imagination for decades: this spirit of devotion to both Faith and Nation is what Prince Henri intends to revive, as the new regime is slowly but surely asserting itself.\n\nFurthermore, with the Papal States on the frontline of the crusade against socialism, it has been decided that the Zouaves would be reformed, welcoming Catholic volunteers from all over Europe. For the occasion, the 1870 banner reading \"Sacred Heart of Jesus, Save France\" was recreated, blessed by the bishop of Algiers, and gifted by the Prince himself to the assembling unit. They will head to Rome and proudly stand guard on the Tiber, representing the French faithful united as one in their duty to defend the Church."

 nfa.536.d:0 "For weeks now, an incongruous and unceasing ballet of indigènes in the most colourful and awe-inspiring costumes has been taking place: an immense tent in the manner of the Bedouins was installed in the royal gardens, lavishly decorated in an eclectic Mauresque style overloaded with royal symbolism. It is there that King Jean in a hybrid, French-Algerian regalia has received hundreds of natives, all in some sort of traditional position of authority. Proud and enigmatic Tuareg chiefs fully clad in their black cheich, westernised Algerian sheikhs conversing in fluent French, the Mossi Mogho Naba, elected bours, or kings of the Wolofs, and noble princes of the various Moorish tribes of Mauritania, among so many others, all accompanied by their escorts. Each one an ally, they have come to be confirmed in their positions and swear loyalty to their Prince, the King of France, many even being awarded French titles of nobility or decorations: one is titled count, the other is awarded the Legion of Honour, another, particularly loyal, was made Peer of the Kingdom.\n\nThis exhausting diplomatic effort was deemed essential to build a stable foundation for our new order in Africa. After all, these traditional elites of their peoples will be called to sit in local assemblies alongside more minor notables, with more authority than they had in decades over their territories, even advising the colonial government in exchange of their undying loyalty. The Republic in her foolish civilising mission had sought to turn the Indigène into a Frenchman. The Monarchy only asks of the Indigène one thing: to serve France, and be ready to fight and die for his King."

Deeply Catholic, the people of Malta were not particularly troubled by the rise of the Action Française and the restoration of the monarchy, though we were keen to manage their sensibilities in the immediate aftermath of the coup de force: this is after all merely a temporary occupation and upsetting the Maltese status quo would mean upsetting our allies.\n\nHowever, we have been approached by representatives of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, better known as simply the \"Order of Malta\", looking for an agreement with the monarchy. Once the rulers of the island from where they embarked on numerous raids against Barbary pirates, a true fighting force made up of the noblest warriors of Christendom, the Knights were defeated by the armies of the impostor Bonaparte. Malta annexed, its possessions seized, the Order was exiled and dispersed. The Hospitallers instead chose to focus on their original mission, caring for the poor and sick. With one exception: an elite auxiliary military corps, mostly dedicated to medical functions, serving with the Italian army. But united Italy is no more and therein lies the agreement the Knights are offering us. In exchange of rather limited concessions, for example granting extraterritoriality to some locations historically associated with the Order, the Knights are offering to reform their auxiliary force to serve under the French flag, assisting us in our crusade to free the Métropole. Of course this would mean taking liberties with a British colony, something our friends would not appreciate, and the actual benefits to us would largely consist in a propaganda opportunity, though the expertise of the Order is undeniable.

A passionate of the Classics, looking back to Rome as the foundation of European civilisation and France as her foremost heir, the practicality of such a project is of little interest to the Master, who extends the definition of \"Latin\" to include the whole of Southern Europe, much of South America, and even South Germany, Switzerland and Romania, gleefully blurring the line between \"Latin\" culture and Catholicism. Though the idea has gained some traction in the most devoted Integralist circles, at home and abroad, as Maurras is after all an icon of our ideological brethren worldwide, the dream is highly unlikely to become reality: careful diplomatic overtures on the topic were received with incredulity by even our closest Entente allies.\n\nNevertheless, under his impulse associations promoting the idea have sprung up in most of the nations Maurras dreams to unite in one single, holy purpose: the destruction of Germany. These groups have even had some limited but rather positive effects, fostering good relations between our nations and turning into what could be described as an international think tank of fellow-minded Integralists."

 nfa.539.t:0 "The Impossible Hajj"
 nfa.539.d:0 "The Hajj is a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca established by the Prophet Muhammad. Each year untold numbers from all corners of the Ummah undertake this journey to the Hejaz: indeed, this pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and every faithful with the means to do so is called to visit the holiest of cities at least once. More than a simple trip, this pilgrimage is meant to be a time of spiritual renewal, purification, and equality in front of God for the Mu’min.\n\nAll over the world authorities offer their protection to pilgrims and France is no exception: since 1916, the French government in cooperation with Muslim notables organises the Hajj of many, giving the opportunity for those who could not otherwise afford it to fulfil this holy obligation. Established by the secular Republic, this involvement in religious affairs could seem peculiar. But passing on this opportunity for France to establish herself as an ally of Muslims would be foolish, as this perception is critical to the stability of the empire.\n\nOnce an adventure fraught with danger, whether these be natural or from caravan raids, the voyage is now much more accessible... or so we thought. With the irruption of war in the Mashriq between the Ottomans and their Arab subjects, undertaking the pilgrimage would be incredibly perilous: not only the Hejaz itself is in the midst of deep instability, but the whole of the Levant is teeming with opposing armies, rebel bands and bandits, the distinction between these groups being more than occasionally difficult to find. Tales of determined pilgrims being robbed, accused of espionage or massacred along the way have already reached us, and so our government has decided to not form an official French caravan this year, instead encouraging the faithful to visit local pilgrimage sites."

 nfa.540.d:0 "This winter is particularly rough, and all over France the scars of war run deep: many are still without a home, in the streets or in precarious living conditions, crowded in refugee camps. Rationing is still a necessity, and the chaos engendered by the desyndicalistion process is making organising an effective response difficult. Neither private charity efforts by unions, individuals or the Church, nor state intervention is proving enough to alleviate the woes of the most vulnerable among us. To make matters worse, our people are still largely focusing on survival: even those with the means to help simply avert their eyes from the needy.\n\nFrom tragedy might come hope, however. Following the terrible discovery of the frozen bodies of a woman and her infant, still clutching rationing coupons, a Catholic priest has taken to the radio to call for an \"insurrection of Goodness\". Abbé Henri Grouès has long been involved in charitable efforts, even recently founding a shelter baptised \"Emmaüs\" welcoming the homeless, but he has now thrust himself to national preeminence. This call from a simple priest seems to have sent a shockwave across France: the consciences of the multitude have finally been forced awake. Donations, both monetary and in kind, are piling up, coming from all over the nation and even abroad, and \"Abbé Henri\" as he is now known is dedicating his entire being to heading relief efforts. Of course, the efforts of a single man could not alleviate the suffering of all Frenchmen, but by his example he has already inspired others to follow in his footsteps: many have flocked to the Abbé, and preparations for the creation of a Emmaüs charity network are already underway."

With the victory of the revolutionary forces, the song became immortal. Incredibly popular, the song is undeniably a republican symbol. However the fate of \"La Marseillaise\" is sowing dissension even among our partisans.\n\nMany have no issue with the song, including Maurras himself, much like few have issues with the Tricolore: it has accompanied Frenchmen in some of the most glorious moments of the last century and its lyrics could easily be understood as more broadly patriotic than republican. On the other hand, a minority desires a total rejection of anything brought by the revolution, arguing that we could not fight one revolution while the embers of the previous one still burn. As such they demand the reintroduction of the anthem instated following the fall of the impostor Buonaparte, \"Le Retour des Princes Français à Paris\", based on the melody of the popular song \"Vive le roi Henri\". A compromise was also proposed: the armies of the counter-revolution had themselves adopted a modified version of the song, called \"La Marseillaise des Blancs\", the \"Marseillaise of the Whites\", with radically different lyrics, which could satisfy everyone: after all it would be a shame to waste such a stirring melody."

 nfa.542.d:0 "The next stop of the diplomatic voyage of Prince Henri is Lisbon, capital of the Kingdom of Portugal. A mere decade after the proclamation of the \"Portuguese Republic\", a broad coalition of royalists took control of Lisbon and declared the restoration of the monarchy from the balcony of the Torreão Poente, overlooking the Terreiro do Paço, beating heart of the city. In 1927 however, following renewed economic turmoil and national humiliation inflicted in Africa by the Germans, a coup was engineered by Lusitanian Integralists, men inspired by Maurras and the Action Française, and a new government set out to restore Tradition and Faith in the small nation and its globe-spanning empire. Portugal had become a living experiment, a showcase of the possibility of the true counter-revolution. Portuguese implementation of the Integralist dream was followed intently by the Action Française, each development praised in dithyrambic articles, each setback explained as the work of red agitators and other saboteurs.\n\nWith France following in Portugal’s footsteps, this state visit is seen by Lusitanian Integralists as a crowning success, proof of their prescience, and by many Portuguese as a source of national pride. The Dauphin toured the many sights of Lisbon and her surroundings accompanied by King Duarte II, before travelling to the small village of Fátima, in a pilgrimage to the site where the Virgin Mary appeared to tens of thousands. The princes and their close entourage then retired to Pena Palace for some well-deserved rest. It seems the two young men bonded over their shared experience and a budding friendship was born. And if court gossip is to be believed, something more might unite the two soon: young King Duarte was apparently struck by the beauty of Henri’s sister-in-law, Brazilian princess Maria Francisca of Orléans-Bragança, accompanying her sister Isabelle on this diplomatic tour. Regardless of these auspicious personal bonds being forged however, one unbreakable now unites our two nations."

Outnumbered and initially suffering heavy casualties, the royal army prevailed thanks to its iron will, winning for the King a decisive victory. One force in particular illustrated itself facing the British Coldstream Guards, sending the elite force in a frenzied retreat, even seizing their banner: the six regiments of the Irish Brigade. These brave exiled Jacobite Irishmen served France for generations, never letting go of their hope to see one day a free Ireland, fighting for our kings against the \"fheall na Sasanach\", the treachery of the British.\n\nTheir dreams have now come true: Ireland is free, and the \"Sasanach\" being our closest allies will not stop us from commemorating Irish blood shed for France and the unbreakable bond uniting our two nations. Royal representatives travelled to Dublin to participate in a ceremony honouring the Irish Brigade on the day of their triumph at Fontenoy, where a monument funded by the donations of French and Irish Integralists was unveiled and enthusiastic speeches, in approximate Irish on our part, approximate French on theirs, were warmly received by a large crowd. The ceremony over, intense discussion took place between representatives of the Ailtirí na hAiséirghe party and our envoys on a variety of topics, such as the translation of the works of Charles Maurras into the Irish language, our ongoing process of counter-revolution, as well as further funding for their movement that they claim will soon be a favourable position to seize power: looking positively starstruck, these determined young men assured us that Ireland will once again stand with France to help us achieve our dream of freeing our homeland, against both Communards and Boches."

Despite our best efforts they remain unreachable, as if they had vanished without a trace alongside their particularly important cargo. We immediately suspected this to be the work of Communard counter-intelligence, which had been at best sluggish for years but recently had been hard at work to root out our valiant efforts to resist anarchic tyranny of the Reds.\n\nAs the fate of our heroes remains unknown, all we can do is rebuild and continue their sacred mission: the high-risk smuggling of French wine from Bourgogne, Bordelais or Champagne to Algeria, a task essential to keep up national morale. Though the purchase of any goods from the mainland is officially banned and likewise the Commune has desperately tried to enforce an embargo against us, there exists a thriving black market controlled in large part by our assets, recruited from either ideological sympathisers or organised crime, with wine and cheese being especially sought after, as they are after all essential goods.

After such a success, possibly helped by a titillating cover and a dirt cheap price, a sequel has already been released and five more are already planned for the next year alone. They tell the thrilling stories of suave French operative Hubert Bonisseur de La Bath, codename 2B 117, who travels around the world to fight bloodthirsty revolutionaries, all in between of what seems to be his main occupation: seducing and breaking the hearts of both high-class ladies and women of the night, of all allegiances, nationalities and creeds, these love affairs of course being described in torrid details. Here, the spy gets involved with Parisian organised crime to secure stolen documents of critical importance, there he stalks the red light district of Shanghai, looking for a turncoat, then we find him singing in a Cairo café or lost in the favelas of Rio: the novels have little artistic merit and will not win any literary prizes but this is of little concern to the author.

The properties of the Anti-France are being seized and redistributed, their commerce pillaged.

Indeed, Naba Koom II praised the work of the native ethnologist Antoine Dim Delobsom "The Empire of the Mogho-Naba" (L'empire du Mogho-Naba). The book is a real innovation, as it is the first ethnology book written by a native of the country it studies. However, the book also spreads a view of the country as being almost complied to bow under the Moogo Naaba, feeding and legitimating the still very existent ambitions of Naba Koom II to make the Mossi kingdom the dominant power in Haute-Volta. This display of ambitions didn't sit well with the other kings, wary of the Moogo Naaba playing between the interests of the French colonists and those of the population to assert the power of the Mossi once again.\n\nRepresentatives of each kingdom came in a delegation to the seat of the colonial governor in Ouagadougou to compell him to take a stand of the matter.

We of course quickly put him out at the time and forbade the CGTT, but it didn't stop it from existing underground. The union always was close from the Tunisian nationalists of the Destour party, and the two underground organisations often work together. This time, they worked to foment a strike amongst the Tunis dockers and in several factories in the south of Tunisia and in Tunis.\n\nIf syndicalist propaganda wasn't already threatening enough, the strikes have also put to the forefront a word of independence for Tunisia. An absurdity of course, but one these workers seem to believe in. In any way, it's going to be the time for a bit of cleaning in the dockers of the port of Tunis, and if the strikers won't disperse themselves, we will have to send the army."

The document tells about known Tunisian nationalists entering the Beylical palace in which the prince Moncef Bey resides. These members of the nationalist Destour party aren't the most important ones - they aren't Habib Bourguiba or Abdelaziz Thaalbi - but most of them are suspected of treason. They come in and leave the palace discreetly and transporting nothing but there is no doubt the Bey is transmitting them important pieces of information. Moncef Bey is the son of one of the previous honorary monarch of the protectorate of Tunisia, Naceur Bey, and is the grand-nephew of the current ruling Bey, Ahmed II. He has always been remarked for his opposition to the French regime and he doesn't hide too much his likening for the Tunisian nationalists.\n\nThe situation is particularly concerning considering Moncef is the next on the line of succession to the statute of Bey after Ahmed II. Whatever he is actually doing to help these terrorists, an opponent can't be tolerated this close to power. With our important military presence, an intervention to 'secure' the Bey shouldn't meet a lot of resistance."

After only 20 minutes the crowd, visibly getting larger by the minute, was already spreading to all of the small streets around the square accompanied by a tumultuous clamour. At the centre of the gathering was a young Algerian militant. Even if only in his twenties, he had a rarely seen eloquence, captivating the crowd around him and even the furthest observers were captivated by his gesture and his visible conviction. He declared himself to be a part of the 'Etoile Nord Africaine' (the North African Star), a nationalist Algerian party with syndicalist tendencies, founded in Paris in 1926 by Messali Hadj. The militant was here on this square spreading the words of the party, defined largely by the leaders and intellectuals of the party still in Paris but spreading more and more to Algeria itself. The ENA advocates for two of the worst possible ideas: Syndicalism and Algerian Nationalism, the party aims to create an Independent Socialist Republic in Algeria, akin to the Commune of France, and oust the French off this land.\n\nThe police took its time to arrive, allowing the speaker to talk for 30 minutes and probably convince some spectators before escaping in the city when the agents finally came to disperse the crowd. This incident can't be ignored, and can't be taken lightly. It is representative of the strategy of the ENA to spread its ideas and supplies to a talented younger generation of militants in Algeria for them to start the fight for independence in Africa with support from the French Commune. While their attempted struggle is far from being over, it isn't a reason to be lenient. We must take care to not let any comparable event happen again."

The fight finally stopped when rumours were heard of coming police.\n\nThis fight of a minor importance reveals the increasing tensions between the two main Algerian nationalist parties. The ENA is a syndicalist party, founded in Paris by Messali Hadj, forbidden in Algeria and radically opposed to the current French rule. The Action Algérienne however is legal and its leader, Fehrat Abbas believes in assimilationism into a Greater France and calls for a greater traditional autonomy. The Action Algérienne is based on the ideas of the Action Française, adapting integralism to an Algerian context.\n\nIn the end, whatever the actual differences are, the good news is that they all hate each other."

In reality the lower classes mostly work under a regime of forced labour called by the colonial authorities, most notably to build infrastructure.\n\nThe Senegalese society is thus very stratified, and this is something the lower classes seem to be starting to realise. Murmurs of jealousy and questioning of the system have spread to the Senegalese working class.

His surprise was thus big when he heard a group of 'évolués' talk about how could Senegal organise itself after any hypothetical independence. The discussion was unbelievable, the 'évolués' were considering a local rule of Senegal and claimed to not be particularly concerned by the French cause! The administrator thus rightfully decided to report back what he saw to the nearest department of the secret services.\n\nFurther investigation has shown this isn't an isolated case. It seems the 'évolués' were fed French political culture so much that they don't accept what they consider tyranny anymore. Most of them seem to prefer a local Senegalese republican rule rather than to obey Frenchmen and fight their wars. It is believed the Commune also acts actively by smuggling nationalist books to this cultured elite in Dakar...

There, unable to rely on cattle farming like they usually do, they had to get more creative. This was the reason for their attack this morning on a Nigerien village, close from the desert but fertile enough to have farms and reserves. A small Tuareg force arrived at dawn to pillage the farms and steal the food reserves, but they didn't anticipate the presence of a small French patrol resting in the village. The French presence wasn't planned, and it only constituted of a few soldiers accompanying a colonial officer, but it was enough to try to stop the Tuaregs. A few shots made one of the horses fall, with a Tuareg tribesman falling on his head. Another Tuareg was shot in the belly, and a French soldier was gravely injured before the force fled and left the village.

With his skills at organisation, he would ensure that more than 15 million shells were fired at the Germans during the first five months of the battle, and Verdun would hold. In April 1919, Pétain would replace Ferdinand Foch as overall commander of French forces but would be unable to organise any offensives before the war ended later that year.

In the Battle of Verdun, de Gaulle would take a bayonet in the thigh and be captured as a result. He would spend the next few months in German captivity. During this time, he read German newspapers, wrote his first book, and eventually escaped. De Gaulle was granted a hero’s welcome when he returned, becoming a symbol of French defiance against the Germans. He would go home to his family but would not be at peace due to the Revolution. De Gaulle and his family would follow the government in exile to Algiers, where he would join loyalist officers. He has become famous in exile as a military lecturer and theorist and is a close associate of Marshal Pétain."

Weygand was admitted to the École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr as a foreign cadet and become a cavalryman. Eventually he would be promoted to captain and become an instructor at the Saumur Cavalry School. At the outbreak of the Weltkrieg he would spend a short amount of time on the front lines before spending most of the rest of the war in the general staff of Ferdinand Foch. Weygand was promoted to général de brigade in 1916. His final promotion would be near the end of the war, as Ferdinand Foch was sidelined by Pétain and Weygand was promoted to fill much needed gaps in command. His new rank as général de division would make him a target by association during the revolution, and he would be one of the generals to flee across the sea. He spends much of his time in Algeria as an inspector for the army and trying to organise what troops the Republic has available."

He would take frontline command of the 159th Regiment of Alpine Infantry and fight in the Battle of the Frontiers as well as defend Arras from German occupation. As the war dragged on, he became witness to the first poison gas attack, and fought at both the Somme and Verdun. His last promotion before the revolution would be to become the military chief of staff to Georges Clemenceau’s second government.
