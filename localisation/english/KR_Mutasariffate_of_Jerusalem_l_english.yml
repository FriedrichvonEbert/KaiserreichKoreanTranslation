 pal.1.d:0 "세계대전의 막바지에 만들어진 국제지대, 예루살렘 무타사리프령는 거의 통제가 불가능한 상황에 놓였습니다. 국경은 '알렌비 라인'의 수비요새를 토대로 한 임의의 경계를 따라 구분되는데, 팔레스타인 일대의 지역을 나눠버린데다 시온주의자 공동체가 하이파 일대에 정착하려는 시도 또한 좌절시켰습니다. 모든 이해당사자들과 타협한 길로서, 어떠한 집단도 행복하지 못할 난해한 행정구조가 만들어졌습니다. 이 곳은 과거, 지중해 바깥의 항구를 확보하고자 홍해가 있는 남쪽으로 확장했었던 쿠뒤스-이 셰리프 무타사리프령의 위에 세워졌습니다.\n\nM.O.J.(예루살렘 무타사리프령)의 행정구조는 두개의 주요 통치기구로 이뤄집니다. 국제이사회라 일컬어지는 기구는 독일, 미국, 오스트리아-헝가리, 영국, 그리고 오스만 제국의 대표들로 구성되어 있는데, 이 지역의 실질적인 권력이자 출입국 및 세금을 통제하며 부속 국제 치안유지군을 감시하고 감독합니다. 또다른 통치기구는 지역 내 모든 종교운동의 대표들로 구성되며, 예산을 감독하는 국제이사회와 긴밀히 협력해 지방정부의 역할을 합니다. 법적으론 여전히 숭고한 오스만 정부의 일부이기에, 이 구조의 가장 위에는 술탄이 직접 임명한 오스만 무타사리프가 존재합니다. 허나 실제로는 무력하기에 통치할 수가 없습니다.\n\n하지만, 팔레스타인계 아랍인들은 협의된 구조와 더불어서 지속적으로 증가하는 유대인 인구, 날이 갈수록 힘을 받으며 증가하는 '성지'로의 이민 때문에 깊은 불만을 품게 되었고, 이들은 곧 국제 치안유지군 및 세금징수기관과 반목하게 되었습니다. 또한, 중동에서 보다 급진적인 변화의 기틀이 되는 이 지역은 카이로의 정권에 의해 더더욱 거세어지는 아랍 민족주의가 일깨워지는 온상이기도 합니다. 칼리프는 본인이 오스만 제국 내부에만 묶여있음을 깨닫고 이 지역기구의 철폐 요구를 늘려가고 있지만, 강대국들의 분노에 시달리고 싶은게 아니라면 어찌 할 방법이 없습니다. 그렇더라도, 오스만 정부의 공작원들과 이웃인 하이파에서 수신되는 선전방송은 팔레스타인 주민들에게 오스만이 통치권을 반환받을 때를 준비시키고, 저항을 도우면서 예루살렘 무타사리프령가 신속히 붕괴되게 하고있습니다."

 pal.7.d:0 "Founded as a radio broadcast to rally public opinion against the M.O.J. and Jewish settlement in general, it has recently increased its operations dramatically as under the table dealings with the Ittihad party have enabled it to set up further posts closer to the border. Although the government denies all responsibility over the organisation to foreign diplomats of the Porte and the Jerusalem Accords representatives, it is no secret that they tie into our governments designs on the Middle East and are used to focus and encourage Arab discontent in the Ottoman Empire."
 pal.7.a:0 "'Is it not the Caliph who has sacrificed you so he could keep his crown?'"
 pal.8.t:0 "Fourth Aliyah Commences"
 pal.8.d:0 "Political developments across the globe have caused great disarray to its settled Jewish population. Now the USA, beacon of freedom and liberty has been hit by another devastating civil war causing thousands of refugees to spill over to all corners of the world. The Jewish population as well, seeing itself targeted by the Union State is suffering, with many now pursuing the Zionist dream. Flocking into the harbour of Tel Aviv, thousands of educated Jews are bringing with them their capital and experience to help create the new Jewish home. Arab discontent at this new influx of Jewish settlers is already mounting further fuelled by the unrest caused by the economic fallout and gendarmerie forces are struggling to keep the order in all corners of the M.O.J."
 pal.8.a:0 "Welcome to the M.O.J."
 pal.9.t:0 "Increased Eastern European Migration"
 pal.9.d:0 "Anti-semitic regimes have taken hold over Eastern European nations leading to an increasing amount of pogroms and discrimination against their Jewish population. With no place to go and their backs turned against the walls of Russia, many are embarking on the long journey South towards Palestine to hopefully find a safehaven. Unwilling to further increase tensions in the M.O.J. multiple members of the local government have asked the Council to close immigration as further encouraging it only plays into the hands of the Arab nationalists."
 pal.9.a:0 "Welcome to the M.O.J."
 pal.10.t:0 "Increasing Sectarian Divide"
 pal.10.d:0 "The rapid increase in Jewish settlers arriving on the shores of Tel Aviv is only further bolstering the Arab aversion to the M.O.J. leading to increasing crimes against settlers and protest actions throughout the region. Mediation from the Mutasarrif has failed to accomplish much as the Mufti of Jerusalem continues to preach for a closure to Jewish immigration."
 pal.10.a:0 "There is no reason to blow up this little bit of friction"
 pal.11.t:0 "Protests Escalate in Jerusalem"
 pal.11.d:0 "Called on by local Arab notables and leaders, a mass protest was held in the city of Jerusalem earlier today to pressure the Council into the closure of the immigration office. What started as a peaceful protest quickly escalated after gendarmerie forces started cracking down on some of its leaders. In response, the protestors started throwing stones at the windows of foreign businesses and assaulting foreign nationals on the streets of the city. Eventually the authorities were able to subdue the protest before further violence could spread but with resources spread thin, the action has scared the International Council that the situation might be far more explosive than initially thought."
 pal.11.a:0 "A curfew is enacted in Jerusalem"
 pal.12.t:0 "Council Closes off Further Jewish Immigration"
 pal.12.d:0 "In response to increasing calls by the Muslim population and the Jerusalem riot only a few weeks earlier, the Council has officially decreed an end to Jewish immigration and has decreed that no further settlers will be allowed entry into the zone until an accord has been reached with the local leaders. Whilst it is unlikely to fully stop immigrants from coming in due to the limited resources of the Council to enforce the decree, this marks an important turning point in the policy of the M.O.J."
 pal.12.a:0 "Let's hope this calms the Arabs down"
 pal.13.t:0 "Riots in Jaffa"
 pal.13.d:0 "Not silenced by the reversal of the immigration policy, riots and protests continued to shake Palestine further encouraged by both Egyptian and Arab movements alike. The breaking point was finally reached in Jaffa earlier today as yet another action against the authorities turned bloody after overwhelmed Gendarmerie opened fire on the Arab protestors leading to the deaths of 23 Arabs. Various governments in the Middle East have already reacted to the events demanding the immediate departure of International forces and the abolishment of the M.O.J. before further violence breaks out. Furthermore this first display of open conflict between the two groups will likely lead to repression against the Jewish settlers and continued actions against the authorities."
 pal.13.a:0 "This isn't going so well anymore..."
 pal.14.t:0 "Violence in the M.O.J."
 pal.14.d:0 "Increasing Jewish migration and a decrease in resources after the American forces pulled out last year has caused violence to erupt once more in the M.O.J. leading to the deaths of multiple dozen Arabs in peacekeeping and strikebreaking actions. Our government has in response increased its calls for the abolishment of the entity, pointing out that only Ottoman rule can end the crisis peacefully. Various Jewish groups across our empire are also calling on the Sultan to take a more decisive stance towards the M.O.J. as they fear retaliation by their Arab brethren for the actions by the International Gendarmerie."
 pal.14.a:0 "Send new orders to our Mutasarrif"
 pal.15.t:0 "General Strike in Palestine"
 pal.15.d:0 "Organised by various Arab National Committees a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping has been called to force the departure of international forces. Listing their demands as 1) Prohibition of all Jewish immigration now and in the future 2) Prohibition of the transfer of territory from Arabs to Jews 3) Immediate withdrawal of the International Gendarmerie, a vast portion of the Arab population is primed to partake in the action encouraged by religious leaders and influential families. The Council has already reported that it will crack down heavily on any attempts to force its departure and gendarmerie forces have already been sent into Jaffa to arrest possible ringleaders of the strike."
 pal.15.a:0 "We will not give up our position!"
 pal.16.t:0 "General Strike Endures"
 pal.16.d:0 "Attempts to crush the strike with force have failed as the entire region has been paralysed by the continued action. Everything from the railways to the administration to the industry has completely laid down the work. Furthermore open conflict has started to roar up again as sniper actions in various cities around the region targetting foreign nationals and guerrilla actions against the Jewish settlers and the Gendarmerie are shaking the countryside. Thinly spread gendarmerie forces are attempting to keep order and the destruction of hundreds of homes in Jaffa in an attempt to flush out the rebels backfired greatly leading to even more pressure in both the city and Jerusalem itself.\n\nAs various partners of the Jerusalem Accords are entangled in domestic affairs with world war looming ever more, the International Council has commissioned a report on the continued viability of the M.O.J. and has opened talks with the Ottoman government to pursue possible solutions."
 pal.16.a:0 "All is falling down"
 pal.17.t:0 "Egypt Demands a seat on the Council"
 pal.17.d:0 "Throwing themselves up as the defenders of all Arabs, the Egyptian government is using the crisis in Palestine to increase its power projection in the region. Answering calls from various Arab organisations in Palestine, Egypt argues that it should have a say in the future of the M.O.J. and its administration. The Ottoman delegation has already vetoed the proposal but the action shows that conflict is brewing ever stronger between the two regional powers and that the M.O.J. might find itself in the middle of their battlefield on short notice."
 pal.17.a:0 "Organise a congress to settle the affair once and for all"
 pal.18.t:0 "Congress of Haifa Opens Its Doors"
 pal.18.d:0 "As violence continues to escalate across the region, the various signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have agreed to partake in a congress to decide the future of the M.O.J. The Ottoman delegation has already put all its cards on the table and has demanded the immediate reunification with Kostantiniyye pointing out that the current chaos is fully to blame on those that took it away from the Porte in 1920. Meanwhile the Egyptian government is openly calling for its attachment to Egypt, claiming that the Arabs should be united and that the Ottoman actions during the Weltkrieg are what led to its creation in the first place. The Committee sent out to investigate the sustainability with the limited Gendarmerie forces available has also returned with a negative answer, proscribing its reunification to the Ottoman Empire but with an overseeing panel ensuring the Jews are kept safe from reprisals and granted land to settle on."
 pal.18.a:0 "The representatives will decide"
 pal.19.t:0 "Congress of Haifa: Future of the M.O.J."
 pal.19.d:0 "As one of the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords in 1920, we have kept a representative on the International Council of the M.O.J. ever since. Recent events in Palestine however have called these powers back together to decide over the future of the international zone as the entire region wages a war against the International Gendarmerie tasked with its security. Thinly stretched forces, limited resources and aggressive moves from both the Sublime Porte and the Egyptians are threatening its future and as the committee tasked with researching its sustainability has given a negative report, many in our own administration are questioning its continued existence."
 pal.19.a:0 "Abolish the M.O.J."
 pal.19.b:0 "We will not withdraw!"
 pal.20.t:0 "International Council Votes for the Abolition of the M.O.J."
 pal.20.d:0 "In response to issues in Palestine, the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have voted in favour of its abolition and the reintegration into the Ottoman Empire. Proposals to return the Sinai to Egypt were vetoed by our representatives to great annoyance of both Cairo and the other powers which ultimately conceded to putting it under joint control by both nations, something those two have already denounced. Whether or not this solves the Palestine issue remains to be seen but what is for certain is that conflict between the Ottomans and Egypt is only starting.\n\nWith the last paperwork still left to be done and an orderly transfer of authority from the Gendarmerie to the Ottoman army being organised, the M.O.J. will continue to function for a week longer although it will no longer have the power to decide on internal matters, now a strictly Ottoman affair."
 pal.20.a:0 "A wise decision"
 pal.21.t:0 "Sinai Question"
 pal.21.d:0 "As the abolition of the M.O.J. approaches after the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords agreed on its reintegration into the Ottoman Empire, issues still remain over the disputed Sinai peninsula. The Ottomans claim it as part of the M.O.J. and before that as part of their Egyptian territory although their main drive seems centred around extending control over the Suez Canal. A resolution offered by the Council to return the Sinai is still under consideration but strongly attacked by the Ottoman representatives. With the Ottoman army mobilising to garrison the region, time is running out to retake control and launch our offensive into the Ottoman Empire as once entrenched it is unlikely we will succeed in dislodging their army which will be positioned within striking distance of our capital."
 pal.21.a:0 "Occupy the peninsula"
 pal.21.b:0 "We will await their decision"

 palkur.1.d:0 "Leader of two failed attempts in Sulaymanyiah to carve out a Kurdish kingdom, the infamous Sheikh Mahmud has been seen in contact once again with representatives of the Iranian government according to our spies. Prominent Qadiri, the Sheikh had the other Kurds to thank for most of his failures as their unwillingness to subordinate themselves to the Sheikh would be their downfall. Ottoman officials in Iraq were quick to exploit their differences and by utilising Kurdish forces opposed to him such as the powerful Jaf, he was forced to flee across the border to Iran.\n\nAttempts by the Iranian government to supply his troops and send them back into Sulaymanyiah to cause havoc on the Ottoman periphery became less and less successful as even his closest supporters started to believe the window had closed. Furthermore the Turks have countered this subterfuge with Kurdish pawns of their own. Simqi the Kurd, famous warlord of Iranian Kurdistan and feared by many an Assyrian for his excessive cruelty near Lake Urmia during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg has found his benefactor in the Ottoman government. Sometimes even going so far as fighting under a Turkish flag, this warlord caused great havoc and even successfully defeated the Iranian army. Nonetheless, reinforcements from Teheran would ultimately prove his demise as he was just like his colleague further South driven across the border.\n\nThis back and forth game between the two powers came to an end in 1927 when the administration of Mustafa Kemal and the Iranian Shah concluded the Saadabad Pact. Both sides would from now on stop fostering Kurdish dissent on the other side of the border as the danger of awakening Kurdish nationalism was regarded as detrimental to the interests of both sides. A few low-level troublemakers were exchanged in a symbolic gesture whilst both sides also confirmed the 1913 Ottoman-Iranian border."

Raids by two powerful tribes, the Hawrami and Hamavand (allies of Sheikh Mahmud during his revolt) have become so unbearable that merchants and other urban citizens have been forced to leave for Kirkuk and Mosul where protection from the local confederations and the Ottoman gendarmerie are granting them much needed respite. Protests against the slow response of the government have also seen an uptick in the region as many Kurds start losing faith in the military to prevent them from harm.\n\nNonetheless the army has sent a detachment of 3000 men and an air squadron into the territory of the troublesome tribes to put an end to their disturbance. The Iranian government was quick to respond that the scale of these troop movements so close to their border can only be a sign that the Turks are planning to invade Iranian Kurdistan and drive out the Kurds currently living there."

To no one's surprise this has given another boost to the morale of the rebelling Kurds who see in the timely return of their hero a sign that the tide is finally turning. Both the Hawrami and Hamavand were quick to pledge their allegiance to the Sheikh and have both sent detachments of their tribes to his base of operation near the Iranian border. Certain factions of the Jaf confederation, still recovering from the blatant attack on their leadership, have also taken his side whilst others remain on the fence as the Iranian support Mahmud promises seems unlikely to arrive.\n\nAs a blatant breach of the Saadabad Pact, the government in Kostantiniyye has demanded an immediate answer from Iran in the matter to explain why they didn't stop the Sheikh from returning. A telegram was also promptly sent to Eastern Anatolia with the orders to arm the remnants of Simqi's army and put them on stand-by for similar operations around Lake Urmia should the Iranians not back down."

Efforts were undertaken in the 19th century to more decisively mark this border, a work that took almost a hundred years when it was affirmed in 1913. Nonetheless both we and the Turks have been sabotaging the other side wherever we can and have done so with great success through Kurdish pawns.\n\nThe 1920s saw an end to this rivalry however as the damage the support for Kurdish agitators on the other side did caused massive ramifications to the loyalty of our own Kurds. The Saadabad Pact was thus created as an agreement between our two governments to cease operations to foster Kurdish national sentiment in 1927.\n\nThe rise of Arab nationalism and the trouble created by the Egyptian government have made our government however 'reconsider' this idea as with the Middle East seemingly set on a course that can only end in war, Iranian hawks have sent the exiled Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji into Sulaymanyiah in an effort to soften up the Eastern flank of the Porte. As a blatant breach of the Saadabad Pact, the Ottoman government has now demanded an explanation and has threatened to tear up the treaty if we do not withdraw at once."

They claim that Mahmut escaped from his guards and was fully on his own able to cross the border. Any incidents he may have caused after that are none of Iran's business which was followed by a snide remark that maybe the Ottomans should look at their own mismanagement instead of shifting blame to other nations.\n\nReports from our agents in Iran and Kurdistan however contradict this statement as reports of Iranian Kurds within the ranks of Barzinji have started to come in. Furthermore the question also remains how he could have possibly financed the host he raised without foreign backing.\n\nTherefore the council of ministers has officially elicited the services of Simqi who has been armed with Ottoman rifles, machine guns and even artillery pieces. Within his ranks, a few Ottoman foot soldiers have also been placed to ensure that he remains controllable by the government if necessary."

 palkur.7.d:0 "An infamous Kurdish warlord, it seems that in response to the action of Mahmud Barzanji, the Turks have sent their own pawn back into our territory. Simqi, a Kurd from the Lake Urmia region is especially known amongst the Assyrians who he brutally massacred together with Ottoman forces when they fled into Iran during the Weltkrieg. He didn't stop there however as during the early '20s he tried to carve out his own Kurdish state with the tacit support of the Ottoman military. It would take multiple embarrassing defeats and a substantial army to finally push him out, leaving the region in tatters.\n\nHis return is therefore all the more disturbing as this seems a clear message from the Ottomans that it is once more interested in the Sunni Kurds of the North. Although the man has little support left standing in the region, the damage is likely to still be immense and should we not strike first whilst the Porte is suffering from blows in the West, we may soon find ourselves severely outgunned."

The former flagship of the Ottoman navy and pride of the Weltkrieg, the Yavuz Sultan Selim-i Evvel, received two direct hits and coupled with the damage endured during the last war was not able to remain afloat. The Sultan Abdulhamid-i Sani and Istanköy also received heavy blows, knocking them out of action for at least six months.\n\nThe attack which many deemed a certain failure has instead become a colossal victory for the Egyptians, causing great consternation from the Greek government and sending shockwaves as far as Cyprus."

Mistaking a German freighter for an Ottoman destroyer and intercepted by an Ottoman fighter squadron, 5 more planes were shot out of the sky with no damage to military installations. The remaining 11 quickly turned North in an attempt to reach Beirut but Turkish pilots succeeded in shutting down their attack. A singular bi-plane was able to return unscathed to its base near Alexandria after it broke away from the main squadron following the failed raid on Haifa.\n\nMany had expected that a successful attack would be highly unlikely but with such a crushing defeat dealt to the Egyptian airforce, morale has taken a plunge.

Changing from the initially reformist ideas ushered by its founders who wanted to tackle the status of Arab within the Ottoman Empire, the Second Arab Congress of 1927 showed the new direction the wind was blowing. Hosted in Cairo just after the successful Egyptian revolution and Ottoman betrayal at the Suez, the dialogue was now controlled by radicals and greater Arab nationalists. Members of Al-Fatat, Hashemite exiles, Algerian revolutionaries, Palestinian desperados all came to the gathering to definitively shift the ideas of Arab nationalism. With the Italian threat dealt with and British presence in the Middle East almost fully eradicated due to the actions of Arab heroes in 1925, attention now shifted back to the Turks.\n\nAlthough the Second Congress didn't get any further than a few strongly worded letters and resolutions no one cared about, this is no longer true. The collapse of the German economy and the growing political instability in the Ottoman Empire have created a new sense of urgency across the entire Middle East.

 palcon.8.t:0 "The Delegation from Iraq Takes the Floor"
 palcon.8.d:0 "After the speaker from Jerusalem finished his speech about the threat that Zionism poses to us all, the floor was granted to the delegation from Iraq. Announcing their support for our brethren in Palestine, they urged the people in the room to not ignore a second threat to the Arab people. The Iranian nation may be trying to paint itself as a friend of the Arabs but it goes without saying that it only does so to weaken its rival in Anatolia and exploit the Iraqi Arabs after the sand has settled.\n\nBefore the representative from Mosul could finish his speech however, the Iranian delegation rose up to protest against their accusations. Should we not focus on our common enemies instead of creating new ones before the first one has been dealt with? As the temperature in the room for the second time rapidly started rising, another brief recess was announced."
 palcon.8.a:0 "To a free and Arab Iraq!"
 palcon.9.t:0 "Ghazi bin Faisal Attends the Conference"
 palcon.9.d:0 "Son of Arab hero Faisal bin Hussein who commanded the Hashemite forces during their revolt in 1916, Ghazi bin Faisal was sent to Egypt in 1920 by his grandfather Sharif Hussein when Ottoman troops marched on Mecca. Taken under the wing of Fuad I, the shy and inexperienced boy became a rallying point for Hashemite sympathisers who fled Hejaz when the Ottoman wali was installed.\n\nUsed to a life of luxury at the Egyptian court, with his various escapades published in the papers, many Hejazi see him as disillusioned and removed from the political realities of the region. His calls for a second Hejazi Revolt and an Arab state stretching from Mecca to Baghdad, whilst very passionate and only briefly interrupted by a poem he wrote to honour his father, have been almost entirely disregarded by the other representatives. When his speech was finally over all representatives clapped politely."
 palcon.9.a:0 "We honour the Hashemite heroes!"
 palcon.10.t:0 "Farouk I Condemns the Zionist Settlers"
 palcon.10.d:0 "After hearing the tragic accounts of Palestinian Arabs suffering at the hands of the international gendarmerie and seeing the latest 'data' on Jewish immigration, Sultan Farouk I finally took to the stage. Condemning the vile deeds his brothers of the faith had to endure, he promised the Syrian delegation his full support and promised that the Palestinian people would soon be liberated. A grand applause followed when all representatives gave him a standing ovation.\n\nNews of his speech was received less well by the significant Jewish community in Egypt itself. These Jews who enjoy fairly good living conditions and political freedom under the Egyptian state, are now afraid that this open attack on the 'Jewish menace' in Palestine could send shockwaves in their direction."
 palcon.10.a:0 "We support the Palestinian people!"
 palcon.11.t:0 "Idris Pleads for Help"
 palcon.11.d:0 "After the speech of Farouk I, the conference has taken a different turn. The charade of a cultural conference to celebrate the Arab people has been replaced with the open discussion of actions to be undertaken against those that threaten the Arab people.\n\nThe exiled Libyan leader Idris I has been building up support for well over a decade and with Ottoman garrisons in Libya becoming careless as heated political debate overtakes the capital, he plans to strike within the year and oust Ahmed Sharif I. Hearing all the kind and passionate words from the other representatives, it is now time to turn these into guns, manpower and donations to ensure his struggle is successful."
 palcon.11.a:0 "We support Idris!"
 palcon.11.b:0 "We can't spare anything"
 palcon.12.t:0 "The Egyptian Ambitions"
 palcon.12.d:0 "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, the time has come to show our hands and dictate the course we will be setting. We will have to tread carefully as the multitude of political groups and resistance cells which our operation relies on if we want to keep the Arab states united behind us after their liberation."

 palcon.12.b:0 "Egypt wishes to liberate the Arab people!"
 palcon.13.t:0 "Egypt Announces Its Goals"
 palcon.13.d:0 "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, Egypt has finally dropped the curtain on its grand designs. As some had already feared - and others hoped - [EGY.GetLeader] has announced his ambitions to incorporate the Levant within his Sultanate. The matter of Iraq was left open but hinting at the creation of a friendly Arab regime in the region. Hejaz would furthermore be ceded to their allies on the peninsula as a payment for their help in the coming war.\n\nMany of the Syrian delegation left the conference in anger as they claim that this is just putting Syria under new management instead of granting it the self-government its people are so clearly demanding. Hejazis are not too keen either on the scheme as they see their brethren of the Arab Desert as underdeveloped and uncultured barbarians who will do more bad than good to the relatively rich coastland."
 palcon.13.a:0 "Let's hope their hubris won't be our downfall"
 palcon.14.t:0 "Egypt Announces Its Goals"
 palcon.14.d:0 "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, Egypt has finally dropped the curtain on its grand designs. Promoting self-government amongst the Arab states, they will strive to retain the various constituents of Arabia as individual units that can decide on their own whether to join a larger Arab state.\n\nRepresentatives from Iraq, Syria and Hejaz are pleased that they will retain the right to determine their future but on the Peninsula enthusiasm is far less high. Not only would they see no rewards from their participation in the war but furthermore they would have to contend with a powerful Hejazi state."
 palcon.14.a:0 "This will be interesting, to say the least"
 palcon.15.t:0 "Iran Leaves the Conference"
 palcon.15.d:0 "As the final resolution of the Conference seems to imply an independent Iraq free from Iranian influence, the Iranian delegation has left in anger. Whether this will impact their decision to take part in the war with the Sublime Porte or - Allah forbid - take the Turkish side remains unclear but it has left a sour taste."
 palcon.15.a:0 "They weren't invited anyhow!"
 palcon.15.b:0 "Reason is not something the Arabs understand!"
 palcon.16.t:0 "The Matter of Socialist Support"
 palcon.16.d:0 "Through the contacts of the Arab lobby in Paris and the cautious cooperation between the Commune and Egypt following the Suez Crisis, many have started to wonder to which degree the Arab cause should be linked to that of the Internationale.\n\nThe Internationale which profits directly from the rising Arab dissent in Algeria and the threat the movement poses to the German ally in Anatolia, is more than interested to provide military equipment and advisors to guide our efforts. Many fear however that there is a cost attached to these. Through a variety of economic deals, closely linked to the oil trade which has proven an important asset in the communard war machine, they see the Arabs being subdued to a new form of imperialism. Furthermore the socialist rhetoric they sprout is a direct threat to the Arab states who are built on rich and powerful aristocrats."

 palcon.16.b:0 "Those heathens can go sell their goods elsewhere!"
 palcon.17.t:0 "Creation of the Cairo Pact"
 palcon.17.d:0 "Enclosed in the final resolution of the Conference, there is the promise by all attendants to join arms should any of them end up at war with the Turks. This resolution which lays the foundation of a military alliance, has been called the 'Cairo Pact' and marks the creation of the first such treaty in Modern Arab history."
 palcon.17.a:0 "We will join the Cairo Pact in due time"
 palcon.17.b:0 "We refrain from signing"
 palcon.17.c:0 "To a prosperous Arabia!"
 palcon.17.e:0 "We will join as soon as we can"
 palcon.18.t:0 "The Conference Draws to an End"
 palcon.18.d:0 "As the sun sets on the Nile, Farouk I closes the conference with another speech. Thanking all representatives for their attendance, it is to all apparent what a formidable display of Egyptian power this really was. Arabs from all groups and social standings have come to be awed by the wealth of Egypt and revel in the freedom that this truly independent Arab state provides. Furthermore Egypt has attempted to unite the different forces in the region and push them all towards an ideology most favourable to the Egyptian state itself."
 palcon.18.a:0 "Look at those fireworks!"
 palnews.1.t:0 "American Forces Depart the M.O.J."
 palnews.1.d:0 "As America descends once more into Civil War, [USA.GetLeader] has given the order to recall all active American personnel from Palestine to reinforce the homefront.\n\nHaving served as one of the most important partners in the International Gendarmerie since its inception in 1920, the withdrawal of the United States has made its forces even more thinly stretched than before. As the situation further deteriorates, German troops have been unwilling to fully retreat as public support in Germany for their involvement remains high."
 palnews.1.a:0 "Johnny is marching home again"
 palnews.2.t:0 "Protests Escalate in Jerusalem"
 palnews.2.d:0 "Called on by local Arab notables and leaders, a mass protest was held in the city of Jerusalem earlier today to pressure the Council into the closure of the Jewish immigration office, which recently expanded its operations. What started as a peaceful protest quickly escalated after gendarmerie forces started cracking down on some of its leaders. In response the protestors started throwing stones at windows of foreign businesses and assault foreign nationals on the streets of the city.\n\nEventually the authorities were able to subdue the protest before further violence could spread but with resources spread thin, the action has scared the International Council that the situation might be far more explosive than initially thought."
 palnews.2.a:0 "This is an affront to our Muslim brethren!"
 palnews.3.t:0 "M.O.J. Halts Further Jewish Immigration"
 palnews.3.d:0 "In response to increasing calls by the Muslim population and the Jerusalem riot only a few weeks earlier, the International Council in Jerusalem has officially decreed an end to Jewish immigration and has decreed that no further settlers will be allowed entry into the zone until an accord has been reached with the local leaders.\n\nWhilst it is unlikely to fully stop immigrants from coming in due to the limited resources of the Council to enforce the decree, this marks an important turning point in the policy of the M.O.J. and an affront to both the Balfour and Talaat declarations."
 palnews.3.a:0 "Palestine will never be free so long Foreigners decide its policy"
 palnews.4.t:0 "General Strike in Palestine"
 palnews.4.d:0 "Organised by various Arab National Committees a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping has been called to force the departure of international forces.\n\nListing their demands as 1) Prohibition of all Jewish immigration now and in the future 2) Prohibition of the transfer of territory from Arabs to Jews 3) Immediate withdrawal of the International Gendarmerie, a vast portion of the Arab population is primed to partake in the action encouraged by religious leaders and influential families. The Council has already reported that it will crack down heavily on any attempts to force its departure and gendarmerie forces have already been sent into Jaffa to arrest possible ringleaders of the strike."
 palnews.4.a:0 "May Allah bless their efforts"
 palnews.5.t:0 "The Congress of Haifa Opens Its Doors"
 palnews.5.d:0 "As violence continues to escalate across the region, the various signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have agreed to meet in Haifa to decide the future of the M.O.J. The Ottomans quickly demanded the immediate reunification with Kostantiniyye, pointing out that the current chaos is fully to blame on those that took it away from the Porte in 1920. Egypt is openly calling for its attachment to Egypt, claiming that the Arabs should be united and that Ottoman actions during the Weltkrieg are what led to its creation in the first place.\n\nThe Committee sent out to investigate the sustainability of continued operations has also returned with a negative answer, proscribing its reunification to the Ottoman Empire but with an international panel ensuring the safety of the Jewish people."
 palnews.5.a:0 "Let us hope that a solution can be found"
 palnews.6.t:0 "The International Council Abolishes the M.O.J."
 palnews.6.d:0 "In response to issues in Palestine, the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have voted in favour of its abolition and the reintegration into the Ottoman Empire. Proposals to return the Sinai to Egypt were vetoed by our representatives to great annoyance of both Cairo and the other powers which ultimately conceded to putting it under joint control by both nations, something those two have already denounced.\n\nWhether or not this solves the Palestine issue remains to be seen but what is for certain is that conflict between the Ottomans and Egypt is only starting."
 palnews.6.a:0 "A wise decision"
 palnews.6.b:0 "This is an outrage!"
 palnews.7.t:0 "Failed Coup d'État in Cairo"
 palnews.7.d:0 "Gunfire could be heard earlier today in Cairo as a group of conspirators stormed the palace. Calling themselves the Society of Justice, the group was planning to restore Abbas II to the throne. The last Ottoman Khedive, Abbas II has recently seen an increase in popularity across the Muslim world due to his Islamist ideas, giving rise to various groups wishing for his return.\n\nNonetheless the failed coup attempt has come to the advantage of the Cairo regime as the close relation between the Khedive and the Ottoman government has shifted public opinion squarely against the Turks. [EGY.GetLeader] himself has already called the attack on his life a vicious plan by the imperialist Turks to smother Arab independence and has reportedly started calling for military action against the Porte."
