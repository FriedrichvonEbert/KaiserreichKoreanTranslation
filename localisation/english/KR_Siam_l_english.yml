 KR_Siam:0 "[SIA.GetSIAshortname] 중점계통도"
 POLITICS_RAMA_VII_DESC:0 "왕명인 라마 7세로도 알려진 프라차티뽁은 형의 죽음으로 1925년에 시암의 왕으로 추대되었습니다. 왕권 승계에 대비를 못한 그는 이전에는 왕위 계승 순위보다 훨씬 뒤떨어져 있었기 때문에 실질적으로는 사촌들에 의해 운영되는 최고국가위원회의 허수아비입니다. 해외유학파이고 영국 육군에서 장교로 임용된 적이 있는 프라차티뽁은 신민들을 진심으로 아끼고 이들의 이익을 향상시키기 위해 열심히 일합니다."
 POLITICS_RAMA_VIII_DESC:0 "Ananda Mahidol, known by his regnal name Rama VIII, has ascended to the Siamese throne following the death of his uncle, Rama VII. Ananda Mahidol was once considered a very unlikely candidate for the throne, being barely a teenager and of low birth. He originally held the rank of 'Mom Chao', making him among the lowest of Siamese princes. Despite his youth and inexperience, he has quickly won the hearts of the Siamese people. Foreign observers, however, believe that he did not really want to be king that his reign would not last long."
 POLITICS_RAMA_VIX_DESC:0 "Bhumibol Adulyadej, known by his regnal name Rama IX has ascended to the Siamese throne following the mysterious death of his late brother, Rama VIII. Bhumibol Adulyadej has so far proven himself much more politically competent than his late brother, navigating the convoluted Siamese political landscape with seeming ease. Many speak of Bhumibol Adulyadej as the saviour of the once embattled Siamese monarchy"
 POLITICS_SUKHUMBHAND_DESC:0 "Paribatra Sukhumbhand, cousin to expected successor to the Siamese throne Ananda Mahidol, has seized control of the Siamese government, citing Ananda's inexperience and his age. With the full support of the Privy Council, he has crowned himself as King Rama VIII, firmly establishing the Boripatr cadet branch as the new ruling house."
 POLITICS_CHUMBHOTBONGS_PARIBATRA_DESC:0 "Chumbhotbongs Paribatra, known by his regnal name Rama IX, has succeeded his father, Rama VIII, to the throne of Siam. Chumbhotbongs Paribatra is something of a recluse, but still politically competent. He is a known patron of the arts, having converted multiple state-owned properties into museums, and has personally sponsored many great artists both in Siam and abroad."
 POLITICS_SUKHUMABHININDA_DESC:0 "Sukhumbhinanda, son of former King Paribatra Sukhumbhand (Rama VIII) and a lowborn woman, was legitimised by his brother King Rama IX due to the latter's inability to produce a male heir. He has ascended to the throne as Rama X. Sukhumbhinanda is a prominent philanthropist whose efforts to relieve Bangkok's poorest have garnered him much publicity. With Sukhumbhinanda's ascension much of the remaining public discontent with the monarchy has dissipated."
 POLITICS_CHULA_CHAKRABONGSE_DESC:0 "Chula Chakrabongse, the half-Ukrainian grandson of King Rama V, has been installed as king of Siam. Chula Chakrabongse lived an eccentric life of leisure in Britain and later Austria before becoming king and has delegated nearly all of his royal duties in favour of his passion for both horse and automobile racing."
 POLITICS_SUPHA_SIRIMANON_DESC:0 "Journalist, Poet, and now the new Premier of the Republic - Supha Sirimanon looked like an odd choice for the national leadership position at first. Within the leftist intelligentsia community though, he is more well-known under his pen name \"Jittin Thammachart\", and as the translator behind Das Kapital's Thai language publication.\n\nWhile an adherent of Classical Marxism at heart, Supha is a Pragmatist and viewed Planned Economy as the way forward - and that there's no way for the Workers and Capitalists to reconcile with each other."
 POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanomyong, also known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', immediately set out to better the lives of the Siamese people upon his appointment as a minister. His controversial 'Yellow Cover Dossier' outlined his political and economic reform agenda and divided the Siamese government, but the controversy only served to further Pridi's political career."
 POLITICS_PRIDI_PANOMYONG_REBEL_WIN_DESC:0 "Pridi Phanmoyong, previously known by his ministerial title 'Luang Praditmanutham', has become the Chairman of the Sapha Prachachon following a brief but bloody Siamese Civil War. Phanomyong's policies of economic nationalisation and radical parliamentarian reform may now continue, however challenges from more radical elements within Pridi's Sahachip Party have grown significantly. Despite his popularity, Phanomyong struggles to maintain his authority even with his allies in the Navy."
 POLITICS_PLAEK_KHITTASANGKHA_DESC:0 "Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, more popularly known as 'Chormpon Por' by the locals and 'Phibun' in the West, the one-time ally of Pridi Phanmoyong and the People's Party has seized power following the Yellow Cover Dossier Affair. Together with Luang Wichitwathakarn and his allies in the military he has built his own cult of personality to side-line the Monarchy. He views the current state of Siam as an 'outdated relic of a bygone era' and intends to use his power to promote militarism and nationalism, proclaiming both to be additional essential principles of the modern nation."
 POLITICS_PHAO_SRIYANOND_DESC:0 "Police Chief Phao Sriyanond has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Soi Ratchakhru Clique. Phao is known for his brutality and political cunning, and his political opponents tend to 'disappear'. Phao also believes the Siamese monarchy to be an antiquated relic which impairs the cause of nationalism, and is thus an avowed Republican"
 POLITICS_SARIT_THANARAT_DESC:0 "General Sarit Thanarat has succeeded Plaek Phibunsongkhram as leader of Siam's military regime with the support of the Sisao Thawaet Clique. Originally a lowly officer in the Phayap Army, he quickly rose through the ranks with Plaek and Phin's help. An ardent anti-Syndicalist, he views the Monarchy as an important tool against the reds and as the focal point of Thai Nationalism."
 POLITICS_THAWAN_THAMRONGNAWASAWAT_DESC:0 "Nicknamed the 'Golden-Tongue Statesman', Thawan is renowned for his public speaking and debating skills, which he fully exploits for his coalition building. As a champion of the grassroots, the ex-Admiral favours policies which helps the common people, such as price ceiling for household commodities and expansion of public welfare. However, these policies also put him at odds with the capitalists and the burgeoning Thai-Chinese middle class who are burdened with greater taxes."
 POLITICS_POTE_SARASIN_DESC:0 "A Thai-Chinese from upper middle-class background, Pote Sarasin's experience in the Ministry of Finance during the Black Monday has shaped his worldview. As fan of the Austrian economist Hayek and a strict adherence to the law, he is against the expansion of state-owned enterprises while trying to ensure the fair, free and open competition. Another policy of his being the expansion of higher education across the nation as a mean to reinvigorate the recovering local industries."
 POLITICS_SENI_PRAMOJ_DESC:0 "As a member of a cadet branch of the Chakri Dynasty with Chinese ancestry, Seni may appear as an odd choice of leader for a republican Siamese state. Despite that, this 'Young Viper' managed to gather enough political clout among the many conservative circles with his own political shrewdness rather than his familial connection to gain a working majority for the new government to function properly. His policy of 'Ngoen Phan' (Money Fluctuation) helps keep the rural area happy and secured from the Syndicalist hands. Whether if he only pays lip services to the republican causes, however, remains to be seen..."
 SIA_iron_marshal_trait:0 "The Iron Field Marshal\n§gBeing known for his charismatic and cunning leadership since his interwar years in Burma, it is no surprise that Phibun would eventually land himself on top of the pecking order. His obsession for total control of the state affairs and his attitude of side-lining the monarchy earned him another nickname - \"Siamese Cao Cao/Caesar\".§!"
 SIA_pho_khun_trait:0 "The Paternal Despot\n§gInspired by Sukhothai's era notion of Pho Khun (Patriarchal rule) and Ayuthaya's despotic rulership, Sarit felt such ruling style fits his political taste the best. He viewed himself as the foremost leader to guide the country through its \"Patiwat\" (revolutionary) phase against the rising leftist tides.§!"
 SIA_under_pho_khun_trait:0 "Paternal Despot's Close Confidant\n§gHis majesty the king is now properly put back on the throne, mimicking Ayuthaya's despotic rulership-style of the past. Whether if the king himself is personally involved with Sarit Thanarat's rise to power, we will never know for sure.§!"
 SIA_prancing_knight_trait:0 "The Prancing Knight\n§gOne simply does not rise to the top position without deceit and deception - Phao lacks neither and is ready to smack down any opposition utilising both trickery and his own heavily militarised police forces in tow.§!"
