 POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence. However, a romantic nationalist, Estigarribia has only encouraged extreme movements which seek to ultimately depose him. Whether he survives politically is an open-ended question that time alone shall answer."
 POLITICS_ESTIGARRIBIA_RETURNED_DESC:0 "José Félix Estigarribia, the Hero of the Chaco War, was internationally educated in both military and agricultural affairs. Estigarribia overthrew the dictator Rafael Franco and ended the societal chaos which marked Liberal rule before his ascendence.\nWith the return of democracy, Estigarribia's political career at first seemed to have come to an end. Estigarribia, however, has defied expectations and again risen through the ranks of the liberal party. Democratically elected, his hold on the state now is nowhere near as great as it once was, and though some fear he shall again seize dictatorial power, the masses cheer on the ever adaptable Hero of the Chaco War."

 PAR_pensions_desc:0 "War veterans, families of the lost and many other personnel receive rightful compensation for defending our nation in the war for the Chaco. However, doing the right thing is often costly and our budget suffers from all the privileges and good payment for military personnel."
 PAR_prussia_desc:0 "Paraguay at this point is an extension of its army, as the Civil War coupled with the failure of mainstream parties resulted in two coups and an almost entire lack of civil presence in actual decision making. The army is however immensely respected, and morale even among the lowest in the hierarchy is sky-high, as are the generous benefits for joining it in comparison to common work available."

 PAR_bm_desc:0 "More than a fiscal crisis, Paraguay suffers from a harsh case of lack of imports, as the few goods imported to South America rarely reach the nation."
 PAR_bm_selfsuf1_desc:0 "After a series of decisive measures, we have finally re-gained out capacity to acquiring goods and started making said goods in our nation. We are taking the first steps towards true independence, as painful as they are."
 PAR_bm_selfsuf2_desc:0 "We have reached industrial output levels high enough for the government to declare our programs a success. An empty boast when it comes to most metrics, but one that increases national morale and thus increased spending in the short turn, as the people regained faith in the economy and the state recovered much of its losses."
 PAR_slash_desc:0 "Harsh budget cuts were the way chosen to deal with our budgetary issues. It won't go well with the military whose pensions are at risk..."
 PAR_elite_army_desc:0 "Truly with no equal, Paraguay is now truly an Army with a State, as its military forces have achieved such hegemony over all matters, and such mastery of their local warfare, its doubtful for its legacy to fade away."

 PAR_training_desc:0 "Strict regimens and expanded funding ensure that we can send every able-bodied man to the field with proper training."
 PAR_exportseffort_desc:0 "Our economy should not be isolated, and we should not hesitate to help our neighbours to recover. The profits we get by fulfilling their import demands are nothing but byproducts of being a good neighbour, wishing prosperity for the continent."
 PAR_freedom_desc:0 "The rampant nationalist zeal in our country came from more than a lack of faith in common politicians, but the utter failure of our nation to properly protect individuals and free enterprise, leading to war and unrest. Part of these fall on our inability to correct our constitution and move away from the shadowy delusions of leftist vultures."
 PAR_doctrine_review_desc:0 "The best way to learn is by studying your own mistakes. Via constant reviewing and advancing, we will always ensure that our forces are neither outdated nor predictable."
 PAR_I_Love_democracy_desc:0 "Our democracy has never been so strong."

 PAR_urbanize_asuncion:0 "Urbanisation of Paraguay Proper"
 PAR_urbanize_asuncion_desc:0 "By encouraging planned urbanisation in Asuncion and Concepcion, we will be able to effectively improve the living standards of our citizens and be able to avoid land speculation. That should also grant us more space for our industry."
 PAR_chaco_boreal_state_cat_up:0 "Encourage Farming in the Chaco Boreal"
 PAR_chaco_boreal_state_cat_up_desc:0 "The Chaco region is scarcely inhabited, but it has tons of free land we can use for farming. Sponsoring farmers to open new farms in the region will help our agricultural exports and encourage immigration to the region.\n§RNote: taking this decision while owning [901.GetName] will unlock a decision to also improve that state!§!"
 PAR_chaco_austral_state_cat_up:0 "Encourage Farming in the Chaco Austral"
 PAR_chaco_austral_state_cat_up_desc:0 "The newly conquered region of the Chaco Austral, rightfully ours, is in dare need of development, since it was left in a backwards state by the Argentinean government. By giving funds to the farmers in the region we are sure the Chaco will be no more a backwards region."
 PAR_misiones_state_cat_up:0 "Encourage Urbanisation in Posadas"
 PAR_misiones_state_cat_up_desc:0 "The newly conquered region of Misiones has just been integrated in our country, and a way to integrate it more deeply will be by proceeding with planned urbanisation in the city of Posadas, the main urban centre in the region. This should ensure the sympathy of the people in the region towards our regime."
 PAR_chaco_boreal_industrialization:0 "Expand Industry in the Chaco Boreal"
 PAR_chaco_boreal_industrialization_desc:0 "The chaco is full of resources, and our booming mining industry should take advantage of that. By providing it more funds we are expecting it to boom even more and bring even more prosperity to our country."
 PAR_chaco_refineries:0 "Build Oil Refineries in the Chaco"
 PAR_chaco_refineries_desc:0 "There is oil in the Chaco, but we need refineries in order to not only sell raw fuel, but also provide fuel to our own country. Building said refineries in the region should help us solving that issue."

 PAR_integrate_misiones:0 "Integrate Misiones"
 PAR_new_challenge:0 "새로운 난제"
 PAR_new_challenge_desc:0 "The Berlin Stock Market has crashed, and its effects are to be felt all around the globe. Its seismic waves have reached Paraguay, and now we have to deal with the enormous damage caused by this economic earthquake. The economy has suffered greatly, so nothing short of radical reforms will help."
 PAR_self_sufficency:0 "Self Sufficiency"
 PAR_self_sufficency_desc:0 "Paraguay's economy is in shambles, but its potential isn't. We should mobilise our budget to start massive industrial, agricultural and infrastructural projects. Paraguay's economy shall become self-sufficient so that we can exploit its full potential."
 PAR_reform_military_spending:0 " Reform Military Spending"
 PAR_reform_military_spending_desc:0 "Right now we spend tons of money to pay our soldiers, but we don't have enough money to equip them. If we spend less in conscripting and more in producing equipment, we should solve this issue while not cutting the military budget."
 PAR_build_buildsake:0 "Building Roads"
 PAR_build_buildsake_desc:0 "While South America, in general, has an undeveloped industrial base, Paraguay's industry is even weaker. We need to construct new industrial complexes and for industrial purposes suited roads and infrastructures to develop our industrial base."
 PAR_agrieffort:0 "Agricultural Effort"
 PAR_agrieffort_desc:0 "A strong industrial base is vital for a modern economy, but we shouldn't ignore all those who won't build toasters, tanks and trucks. We need to set up agricultural subsidies and agricultural institutions which help our rural farming population."
 PAR_factorio:0 "Import Substitution Program"
 PAR_factorio_desc:0 "A self-sufficient economy can't rely on imports, that's self-explanatory. We should find ways to avoid importing goods, we need to substitute everything that isn't made in Paraguay."
 PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency:0 "Industrial Self Sufficiency"
 PAR_indistrial_selfsufficiency_desc:0 "Our self-sufficiency plan works, that's for sure! Paraguay's economy now relies much less on imports and our manufacturing section is growing daily. 'Made in Paraguay' really does work."
 PAR_new_budget:0 "Slash The Budget"
 PAR_new_budget_desc:0 "Our state spends too much money, way too much money. We need to make cuts everywhere and anywhere if we wish to avoid bankruptcy. Most Paraguayans, from bureaucrats to veterans, won't be too happy with this, but we don't want to end up like the French in 1789, now do we?"
 PAR_national_liberalism:0 "National Liberalism"
 PAR_national_liberalism_desc:0 "The state can't play god, that is a sad reality. Instead of handing over the economy to the bureaucrats, we need to liberalise it in favour of private enterprise and economic freedom."
 PAR_export_focus_economy:0 "Export Focused Economy"
 PAR_export_focus_economy_desc:0 "The Paraguayan market is quite small, but the German market isn't. In order to maximise the strength and the profits of the Paraguayan economy, we need to augment the exportation of Paraguayan goods to the whole world."
 PAR_increase_yields:0 "Increase Mining Yields"
 PAR_increase_yields_desc:0 "The mining sector is relatively small, but even then the Chaco still has quite important resource deposits. We need to increase the productivity of the mining sector so that we can export more primary resources."
 PAR_cut_veterans_pensions:0 "Cut Veteran's Pensions"
 PAR_cut_veterans_pensions_desc:0 "The pensions paid to the veterans of Paraguay are simply too high for the state to support. We need to cut their pensions, even if this will severely anger all those affected."
 PAR_cut_military_incentives:0 "Cut Military Incentives"
 PAR_cut_military_incentives_desc:0 "Our military is quite enormous in comparison to the state. Our military spending is far too high, and it has not stopped rising. We need to cut military incentives before our state collapses under the burden of the military budget."
 PAR_a_day_to_remember:0 "History or Death!"
 PAR_a_day_to_remember_desc:0 "This is a day when the destiny of Paraguay will be decided. Will democracy be able to hold, or will radical forces prevail?"
 PAR_how_am_I_still_alive_questionmark:0 "Democracy Has Been Saved!"
 PAR_how_am_I_still_alive_questionmark_desc:0 "Forces loyal to the Estigarribia and the Colorados were able to repel extremism. Now the country and our fragile democracy have been saved, and a bright future shines in front of Paraguay and its people."
 PAR_military_angery:0 "The Military Takes Control!"
 PAR_military_angery_desc:0 "Turns out, cutting the budget of the military in a country where the military IS the country is not exactly a popular move. Now that the military took control, we will have to see what will come for Paraguay and its people."
 PAR_black_monday_is_over:0 "A Stronger Paraguay!"
 PAR_black_monday_is_over_desc:0 "We have faced the biggest economic crisis of the century, but we were able to overcome it. Our nation has never been that strong, and the future smiles on us, for peace and justice await us in the future."
 PAR_frick_economy:0 "Masters of Our Own Economy"
 PAR_frick_economy_desc:0 "No more foreigners will be able to dictate what the economy of our country should be! We will be the masters of our own destiny, for no one can dictate it. The foreigners can be mad at us, we don't care about them nor about trading with them. There is only one thing we will fight for, and that will be our proud and shining nation!"
 PAR_defensores_del_chaco:0 "Defensores Del Chaco"
 PAR_defensores_del_chaco_desc:0 "Our beautiful nation has significantly grown in the last years at the cost of Bolivia. Our glorious soldiers have proven their strength and will on the battlefield, but now it's time to consolidate our gains. The Chaco will forever remain Paraguayan!"
 PAR_doctrine:0 "Doctrine Review"
 PAR_doctrine_desc:0 "A major army reformation is required to defend our vast country. One of the most important things a modern army needs is a definite, efficient military doctrine. We need to overhaul ours to ensure that our army will win every battle."
 PAR_women_in_the_workforce:0 "Women in the Workforce"
 PAR_women_in_the_workforce_desc:0 "Our country, despite being more than twice the size of Uruguay, has half its people. Our male population is not enough to produce everything we need, and we need to have also our female population produce our weapons. While some conservative elements might protest this measure, we don't really have that many options to go with."
 PAR_pupupupush:0 "Concentrated Fire"
 PAR_pupupupush_desc:0 "We cannot let the enemy reorganise and consolidate their forces after one of our successful offensives. We must attack them until we arrive in their capitals so that they will never have time to rest."
 PAR_firepower:0 "Superior Firepower"
 PAR_firepower_desc:0 "Our nation doesn't have as many fighting-able men as Argentina or Brazil, so we need to compensate our low manpower with high firepower. Let's adopt a doctrine focusing on superior firepower and combat strength."
 PAR_harry_spotter:0 "Spotters & Scouts"
 PAR_harry_spotter_desc:0 "There is one major issue with long-range artillery pieces: If we don't know where exactly the enemy is, we will just blow up a few squirrels. We need spotters and scouts that can accurately report the position of the enemy."
 PAR_shock_n_awe:0 "Shock & Awe"
 PAR_shock_n_awe_desc:0 "Speed is the key to all modern war. It must be the main focus of our army if we are to defend our national borders."
 PAR_military_science:0 "Military Science"
 PAR_military_science_desc:0 "The process of reinventing our military doctrine was long and exhausting as we were missing enough theorists and military experts. We should invest more in military science to avoid this situation from happening again."
 PAR_logistcial_expertise:0 "Logistical Expertise"
 PAR_logistcial_expertise_desc:0 "One of the largest Bolivian shortcomings during the Chaco War was their supply system, as their communication and supply lines were inadequate. We should learn from their mistakes so we don't repeat them."
 PAR_new_army:0 "The New Army"
 PAR_new_army_desc:0 "Our glorious army won against Bolivia, but many doubt that we will win against Argentina or Brazil, who both own lands that are rightfully ours. We need to modernise and professionalise our army."
 PAR_guns:0 "Improved Equipment"
 PAR_guns_desc:0 "Our equipment is rather outdated, which gives us a disadvantage on the battlefield. We need to modernise and improve them to keep up with the armies of our rivals."
 PAR_supply_capabilities:0 "Army Railways"
 PAR_supply_capabilities_desc:0 "A large issue that the Bolivian army faced in the Chaco War was the lack of proper infrastructure suited for military usage. We should not make the same mistake: We need to construct railways suited for military transportation."
 PAR_milfac:0 "Intensify Military Production"
 PAR_milfac_desc:0 "Our new railways have a large transportation capacity, but if our production capacity is low, we will not be able to use these railways. We need to increase the production of military equipment."
 PAR_extreme_training:0 "Superior Training"
 PAR_extreme_training_desc:0 "Unlike the veterans of the Chaco War, the new recruits have little actual combat experience. We need to improve our training to keep a relatively high standard of experience in our army."
 PAR_every_man_a_soldier:0 "Every Man a Soldier"
 PAR_every_man_a_soldier_desc:0 "Our population is roughly one million. In comparison, Argentina is the home of almost fourteen million. We need as many men as possible to fill our army if we wish to reclaim our rightful lands."
 PAR_no_pasaran:0 "No Pasaran!"
 PAR_no_pasaran_desc:0 "Every man in Paraguay knows how to handle a rifle, and is willing to employ his knowledge if the enemy dares to advance in our sacred land. The enemy shall pay in blood for every meter of Paraguayan land he conquers."
 PAR_extreme_army:0 "An Army With No Equal"
 PAR_extreme_army_desc:0 "Nowhere in the world, not even in 19th century Prussia, has an army been so well integrated into the state that it forms a union with the other national institutions. Nothing is as mighty as our armed forces."
 PAR_general_staff_power:0 "General Staff Review"
 PAR_general_staff_power_desc:0 "Our army has greatly expanded, but our general staff has been lacking behind in personnel. We need to review our general staff to increase its command capacity and effectiveness."
 PAR_specialforcetraining:0 "Extend Special Forces Training"
 PAR_specialforcetraining_desc:0 "Specialised units always require more training than their ordinary counterparts. We need to increase the effectiveness of the training so that more soldiers can effectively fight as members of a specialised unit."
 PAR_need_a_dispenser_here:0 "Expand the Engineers Corps"
 PAR_need_a_dispenser_here_desc:0 "It is said that the infantryman's best friend is its shovel, and that is true especially in regards to the engineers corps. By providing them better equipment and stricter drills, we can expect our engineers to become the best engineers of Southern America."
 PAR_planning:0 "Well Planned Attacks"
 PAR_planning_desc:0 "We can't let our soldiers charge in a disorganised way to the enemy machine guns, we need to plan thoroughly our attacks in order to minimize the casualties and strike like thunder, shattering the enemy forces and breaking them like a twig."
 PAR_anti_air:0 "Static Anti Air"
 PAR_anti_air_desc:0 "Despite our efforts in creating an air force, we simply lack the capabilities to build one. In order to protect our homeland we should invest into static anti air stationings capable of taking down even the biggest of the bombers out there."
 PAR_river_patrols:0 "River Patrols"
 PAR_river_patrols_desc:0 "Paraguay has many rivers patrolled by gunboats, each one carrying a huge amount of firepower compared to what a rifle can do. If we can coordinate them to the army, we will be able to make every one of our rivers uncrossable for the enemy."
 PAR_army_railways:0 "Army Railways"
 PAR_army_railways_desc:0 "It's been proved by Von Moltke the senior that railways can change the course of a war, yet we are reluctant to expand them. Well, not anymore, our army will now be able to strike faster than a hawk."
 PAR_army_of_the_future:0 "The Army of the Future"
 PAR_army_of_the_future_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, our army can't be really said to be modern: we lack airplanes, tanks, trucks, and way more equipment to effectively turn into a modern army. While we can't produce that, we can at least research them for the future."
 PAR_big_planes:0 "Bombers Research"
 PAR_big_planes_desc:0 "Bombers can shatter enemy railways and enemy factories, but they are incredibly expensive to build. We can hope that in the future we will be able to produce them, but for now all we can do is research them."
 PAR_paraguayan_bias:0 "Armoured Warfare"
 PAR_paraguayan_bias_desc:0 "There is a new king of land warfare. It's not the infantryman, it's not the artilleryman, and it's not the horse. That is the tank, a steel monster that can spout fire and cannot be stopped. If we wish that our soldiers will be able to face enemies in the future, investing in tanks is the right move."
 PAR_defensores_del_cielo:0 "Defenders of the Sky"
 PAR_defensores_del_cielo_desc:0 "Our beautiful blue sky is the home of many rare birds, but sadly our enemy doesn't seem to respect its quietness. We need to form a professional air force to defend the Paraguayan sky!"
 PAR_cas_focus:0 "Low Altitude Craft"
 PAR_cas_focus_desc:0 "Industry and infrastructure aren't the only bombing targets there are, enemy units are also great targets. In order to effectively weaken enemy forces, we need more agile low flying bomber aircraft."
 PAR_fighters:0 "Fighter Aircraft"
 PAR_fighters_desc:0 "If we wish to use bombers and close air support aircraft effectively, we need to first achieve air superiority. We need specialised fighter aircraft to intercept and destroy enemy planes."
 PAR_estigarribato:0 "The Estigarribiato"
 PAR_estigarribato_desc:0 "Our nation has suffered under political crises for far too long. It is time for our great leader to finally step in and protect the people of Paraguay from internal and external threats. Long live president Estigarribia!"
 PAR_national_heroics:0 "National Heroics"
 PAR_national_heroics_desc:0 "Our nation is a nation of heroes, a nation filled with the greatest people of history. We should never forget the people who fought for our freedom, protected our institutions, and advanced Paraguay to the beautiful nation that it is today."
 PAR_PUS:0 "Paraguayan Union State"
 PAR_PUS_desc:0 "Our nation isn't a 'military dictatorship' like some politicians call it, it's a union of the people, the military, the state, every part of Paraguay! The Paraguayan state has never been this united."
 PAR_paraguay_first:0 "Paraguay First"
 PAR_paraguay_first_desc:0 "Our nation is the best, the greatest nation in the world! Our nation has priority in front of all the nations which aren't Paraguay. Our nation shall always be first place!"
 PAR_peace_and_justice:0 "Paz y Justicia"
 PAR_peace_and_justice_desc:0 "Paraguay has never been this stable, this well-protected, this united. Our new, better regime has introduced Paraguay to a never-ending period of peace and stability."
 PAR_colorado_resurgence:0 "Colorado Resurgence"
 PAR_colorado_resurgence_desc:0 "The last Colorado president Paraguay has had was in 1912 with Pedro Pablo Peña who was deposed very quickly. This has left our country with a nearly unchallenged Liberal rule for decades. However, broken promises from the liberals and an ailing economy are leaving many Paraguayans disillusioned. We shall reach out to the common Paraguayan and offer them the solutions the Liberals didn't give them."
 PAR_true_values:0 "True Values"
 PAR_true_values_desc:0 "The Colorados has always been a conservative party. During the liberal governments, the Paraguayan populace was forced through several progressive reforms which many didn't agree with. Now that we're in power, we shall take steps to protect our nation's traditional and familiar values to secure our society for a better, more stable tomorrow."
 PAR_prosperity:0 "Prosperity and Progress"
 PAR_prosperity_desc:0 "We Colorados know that the only way forward for our country is with hard work. We have to focus this spirit towards achieving economic prosperity and progress, that way we shall both be true to our ideals and help our country get back on its feet."
 PAR_individual_freedoms:0 "Individual Freedoms"
 PAR_individual_freedoms_desc:0 "The Liberals had a mouthful of how their progressive reforms were helping the country. They proved to be unreliable and treacherous. We shall champion individual values and begin legal reforms to include individual freedoms into our current law code."
 PAR_democracy_survives:0 "Sane and Free Elections"

 par.1.d:0 "After the devastating War of the Triple Alliance, Paraguay was shattered and broken almost beyond recognition; the vast majority of its male population dead or orphaned. The extreme demographic and economic damage was not all, however, as both Brazil and Argentina took slices of land off the Guarani Republic and effectively only kept its sovereignty as a buffer state between the two nations. Rebuilding and recovering from that disaster was no easy feat, and political instability still corroded the nation. In 1904, a Liberal revolution against the rule of Colorados broke out. The Liberal rule started a period of great political instability, which culminated in a Civil War in 1922 between rival political factions. Then, in late 1929, war again came to Paraguay by the hand of Bolivia. That nation, under economic pressure to secure the rumoured oil wells of the Chaco region, aggressively started to assert its claims in the disputed area. The Chaco War took four gruesome years, and by 1933 Paraguay had completely routed the Bolivian forces and was starting to occupy their lands. The total victory did not come without a cost, however, as mounting debt and military expenses continue to be a burden on the government. The Bolivian military was poorly equipped and poorly trained to fight in the region, and its low morale meant the Paraguayan casualties were far smaller. The political situation did not improve, however, and the Liberal rule was faltering. Rafael Franco and other radical leaders launched a coup in 1934 based on left-authoritarian principles but were deposed after a short three-month rule by Chaco War hero José Félix Estigarribia. Now, the age of liberal chaos is over, and José Felix's rule is one of great peace; his actions against the \"Syndicalist\" Franco and Bolivian invaders greatly influenced politics, as he is now almost unanimously acclaimed as a national saviour and hero. With the rise of the Argentinean Patriotic League, Estigarribia and his cabinet are again in high alert, as Manuel Carlés did little to hide his expansionist goals in his speech upon ascending to leadership. War may soon be upon Paraguay once again."

Several patriotic generals and officers took advantage of the situation and presented themselves as the alternative, touring barracks to expose their views and prepare an uprising.\n\nBack in Chile, Rafael Franco wasn't oblivious to the situation at home. Informed by frequent letters of his supporters, he orchestrated from Santiago a violent takeover, repeating his short-lived coup of 1934. In much the same way, his supporters in the army came and go in the barracks, preparing the minds with propaganda and securing the coup regiments by regiments. In this bubbling atmosphere, loyalties weren't gained only by morals, but also with bread. The seditious generals and Franco didn't hesitate to use their personal funds to win over useful regiments.\n\nFinally, several barracks rose up today across the country against our failed economic policies, and it seemed that democracy stood on its knees. The soldiers loyal to the Patriots or to Franco moved against places of power, and the takeover attempt degenerated into open fight in the streets of Asuncion. Some units still loyal to Estigarribia and the Colorado party have, however, sworn their loyalty to the regime, and fought to defend the democratic state.

 par.33.d:0 "Worrying news from Asuncion! We have received a report that Rafael Franco returned from his exile and has now couped the Paraguayan government. They have declared they have no interest in continuing being part of an anti-syndicalist defensive pact and the previous treaty is now null. From now on, we will have to rely on one less ally."
 par.33.a:0 "You are joking - not another one! Oh, for God's sake, I can't, this is the second time a socialist coup happens in Paraguay in less than a decade."
 par.34.t:0 "Victory against Argentina!"
 par.34.d:0 "There is no man more heroic than he who stands against giants, and there is no nation more heroic than the small one which defies those that seek to dominate them - and the proud Paraguayan nation has been at the mercy of her powerful neighbors for her whole life. In 1864, she chose to fight to preserve the territory that rightfully belonged to her and assert her right as a sovereign state, a decision that we nearly paid for with our lives. The insistence of Francisco Solano López on fighting to the death has left his legacy fiercely disputed, and our nation deeply traumatized - the sheer death toll the War of the Triple Alliance took was beyond all comprehension.\n\nBut in 1932, Paraguay stood up - once more, we defied the infernal designs of our enemies, wading into a war against Bolivia that the world thought we could never win. In the Chaco War, we shocked the world by routing the Bolivians all the way back to La Paz despite being outnumbered, defending our right to our country and proving that we are a power to be respected. After 60 years, the sorrow of our near-destruction had given way to triumph and renewed pride.\n\nAt long last, our victory is now complete - once again, we have stood against Argentina, and today we have come out the better. The bravery and cunning of our soldiers have cast our enemies from Chaco and Misiones, and have finally returned these long-lost lands to our nation. In the streets of Asuncion and across the countryside, the people shout 'Victory!' and celebrate the avenging of 1870 - no more will we be at the mercy of other nations, no more shall we be cast adrift in the world. Come what may, Paraguay shall fight, against all who would harm her - the Guaranì spirit shall never be destroyed! They will speak the names of the heroes of Paraguay on all corners of the world!"
