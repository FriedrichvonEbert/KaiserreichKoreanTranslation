While other Dutch companies prospered, Shell suffered the catastrophic loss of their British holdings in the Revolution of 1925, a situation only alleviated by our accession to the German economic sphere of the Reichspakt.

 HOL_draft_able_unemployed:0 "Forced Labour Draft"

 HOL_finish_fortress_holland:0 "Media Censorship"
 HOL_finish_fortress_holland_desc:0 "We cannot just trust the intellect of the common man, and need to those block dirty syndicalists where we can. By censoring most French media, and limited censorship of known syndicalist affiliated media, will dam these muddy waters."

 HOL_privatization_of_projects_desc:0 "Our investments have borne fruit: companies are expressing their interest in taking over some of our national projects in hopes of making a profit off them. To do this, they will need to hire people, who will in turn spend more money.

 HOL_precrisis_export_rates:0 "위기 전 수출율로 복귀"
 HOL_precrisis_export_rates_desc:0 "Our efforts to make Dutch companies as lucrative as possible have borne fruit: export rates are returning to pre-crisis levels, and in some sectors even exceed these levels. To handle the workload, companies are forced to hire more people, resulting in more spending power for the common man. While this may not amount to full recovery yet, it is possible to see a bright horizon ahead of us."

 HOL_more_spending_power:0 "구매력 증가"
 HOL_more_spending_power_desc:0 "Our large investments in the military are resulting in people finding work across a number of sectors, ranging from the production of weapons to serving in the army themselves.

 HOL_recovery_from_black_monday:0 "검은 월요일로부터의 회복"
 HOL_recovery_from_black_monday_desc:0 "Our sound strategy to fight the economic collapse that ensued after Black Monday has resulted in the stabilisation of our economy. In all sectors, more people are employed, more products are sold and increasing liquidity is floating around. It seems we succeeded in guiding the country through a hard time, and people are confident in the future once again."
 HOL_repay_government_debts:0 "정부 부채 상환"
 HOL_repay_government_debts_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact of life that money does not grow on trees, and the government has been forced to issue a number of bonds and requested loans from foreign investors to fill the void. It is imperative that we pay these debts off sooner rather than later."
 HOL_control_inflation:0 "인플레이션 통제"
 HOL_control_inflation_desc:0 "With inflation still uncomfortably high because of the Black Monday, we must enact deflationary measures to get it under control.

 HOL_restore_regulation:0 "위기 전 규제의 부활"
 HOL_restore_regulation_desc:0 "The somewhat brutal policies of the Black Monday years have served their purpose well, incentivising business and getting government spending. All the same, it is vital that we restore our nation's lost confidence by restoring some of their long-deserved privileges."

 HOL_SDAP_question_desc:0 "With the Netherlands entering a new socio-political order, the time has come to consider whether to allow the somewhat centrist SDAP to stand for election to the assembly that will decide the nation's future. It may be a Trojan Horse for reactionaries."

 HOL_council_of_the_state_desc:0 "The Council-Communists under Anton Pannekoek and his KAPN have taken a majority in the new Assembly, becoming the leading constituents of the Volksraad executive body. Known for their opposition to formal decision-making bodies, this has come as quite a shock."
 HOL_vakbondsfederatie:0 "노조 연합"
 HOL_vakbondsfederatie_desc:0 "The Assembly's majority choice appeared to be the syndicalist NAS party under Jacques de Kadt, who has called for Communard-style rule under a 'federation of trade unions'. The most 'orthodox' of the serious leftist groups in the state, the NAS was a clear compromise between all involved."
 HOL_socialist_republic:0 "사회주의 공화국"
 HOL_socialist_republic_desc:0 "Henk Sneevliet's radical socialist RSAP party has been elected with a majority by the Assembly as the new government.

 HOL_social_democracy:0 "사회민주주의"
 HOL_social_democracy_desc:0 "Shocking many of those present in the Assembly, it appears that the Volksraad elected was indeed that of the moderate SDAP under Willem Albard. It appears that, for the other more militant factions of the revolution, allowing the SDAP to take part in the elections proved to be a serious mistake."
 HOL_peoples_military:0 "인민의 군대"

 HOL_CNA_gamble_worked_desc:0 "The ruling CNA has managed to score yet another electoral victory, continuing its unopposed rule of the nation.

 HOL_break_up_soc_pillar_desc:0 "While the Socialist pillar has until now been a mostly tolerable focal point for more legitimate and less violent dissent against conservative rule of Holland, it poses a threat that goes far beyond the sum of its parts.

 HOL_new_flag_protocol_desc:0 "One simple manner by which we can rekindle the spark of Dutch pride in our countrymen is to codify a new flag protocol.

 HOL_Syn_Flood:0 "Prepare the Inundation Lines"
 HOL_Syn_Flood_desc:0 "Ever since our independence war against the Spanish in the 16th century, inundation, or intentional flooding of the land, has been an integral part of our defences. Properly prepared, it will surely save us again: we have yet to see a tank that can cross water."

 holpostel.19.d:0 "A number of people have increasingly viewed our government as too soft on the forces of extremism tearing the Netherlands apart. On the other hand, the VNH and its use of extrajudicial measures against the syndicalists have gained it great support amongst the population.\n\nNow the Landwacht, which has gained a great deal of influence in past months, has come together in Amsterdam to march to the Hague on foot.\n\nThe Queen, seeing that the Landwacht has now grown so strong and so influential within the military, has recognised that resisting what clearly represents a coup would be futile. Therefore, Wilhelmina has dismissed our government in favour of a new VNH cabinet led by Swart that plans on ruling the country like a dictatorship."

 holpostel.20.t:0 "범죄율 급증"
 holpostel.20.d:0 "As the recession continues, more and more unemployed Dutchmen are turning to crime as a last resort to support themselves and their family.\n\nThe result is that the paramilitary Landwacht and Red Front are getting a policing role in those areas where they reign supreme and the police is unable to keep this trend in check. This is in turn leading to growing sympathy amongst the population towards the political movements behind these organisations.\n\nIf we are to avoid membership of more extreme political ideologies growing, then we must stop this, though that will probably not be a popular measure."

As a result, many are advocating the prohibition of sales of alcoholic beverages. Still others, say this goes against the freedom of the individual."

 holpostel.22.t:0 "Alcohol Crime Cartels"
 holpostel.22.d:0 "Not so long ago, the only parties that kept our streets unsafe were political in nature, but since we have started to prohibit the sale of alcoholic drinks, several criminal cartels involved in smuggling or producing liquor have sprung up. What is worse, they are fighting each other for the sole right to sell liquor in certain areas. The police are far from capable of keeping this in check and as a result the Red Front and Landwacht have started to supplant them in keeping the streets safe. Either we rescind the prohibition and give in to criminals, or we keep things as they are, probably resulting in the extreme left and right taking credit for containing the cartels."
 holpostel.22.a:0 "Abandon the prohibition."

 holpostel.23.d:0 "'Arbeiders drinken geen bier' is the name of the syndicalist campaign to fight alcoholism in the working class, seeing it as method by which the reactionaries and capitalists keep the proletariat crushed underfoot. As alcoholism became a growing problem in the Netherlands, and with the governments unwillingness to act on it, independent conservative movements pursuing the same goal started to work together with the syndicalists, resulting in growing sympathy for both ideologies and increasing political polarisation."

 holpostel.24.d:0 "Since the beginning of the crisis many sections of our welfare system have deteriorated, and the country is filled with unemployed people who can hardly obtain the food required to support their families. As a result, the VNH has started a nationwide campaign distributing food to these areas and opening food banks and soup kitchens. These actions have created a lot of goodwill towards them and makes it look like, even though they are currently not in power, they are the ones who care for the people.\n\nWe could shut their project down, but risk inciting a great deal of anger amongst the working classes."

 holpostel.25.d:0 "The NVV, the most important social democratic union within the Netherlands for years, has, according to the latest CBS report, been overtaken by the syndicalist NAS in terms of membership.\n\nThis is a bad sign for the SDAP, as it sends a loud signal that their power base is quickly leaking away to the more radical side of Dutch politics. It also provides evidence that their pillar, so far untouched by the ongoing process of depillarisation, is now undergoing the same crumbling that the other pillars have felt. The NAS becoming the most important trade union in the country has the potential to be very dangerous, therefore some voices in our government have called for an official announcement that we will not countenance any negotiations with the NAS, hopefully limiting its appeal."

The problem is that there is a significant portion of our population who actually believes this rubbish, and we have little to no way to shut down a radio station based in a country our relations are hostile with, to say the least."

Police arriving at the designated location did not find anyone present despite a prolonged search. According to the law, the smugglers will be designated 'unwanted foreigners' and evicted, but the Central Intelligence Service wants to interrogate the men; they might be affiliated with the Communard government which would make this an act of espionage."

 holpostel.32.t:0 "French Nationals Confess"
 holpostel.32.d:0 "The French nationals we apprehended at the border a few days ago came clean with their plans to the GS III after the interrogation: apparently they sought to supply explosives to a local Sorelian-affiliated group in order to blow up the Amsterdam Centraal Station, the heart of our nation's train infrastructure, in an operation that is at least not directly attributable to the Communard government.\n\nThey have given up their contacts within our country and the police are ready to shut down every foreign Vanguardist terrorist cell residing within our country."

 holpostel.33.d:0 "Despite a prolonged interrogation, the GS III has been unable to extract any meaningful information from the French nationals we captured at the border.

 holpostel.35.t:0 "French Nationals Die"
 holpostel.35.d:0 "After a prolonged interrogation, that became very emotional for a while, one by one the French nationals somehow ended up dead. Obviously, it was purely accidental and of course we had nothing to do with it as we would never violate the constitution by torturing these people. Still, the fact remains that we still do not know what they were planning with those explosives, but at least the world is better off with seven syndicalists removed from it."

 holpostel.36.d:0 "The Amsterdam Central Station, the heart of rail infrastructure in our country, has today been blown up resulting in 127 deaths. Responsibility was claimed by a small syndicalist group affiliated with the Communard Sorelian faction in France.\n\nAfter investigation of the debris, it appears that the explosives used are the same as those confiscated from a group of French nationals that were smuggling them. It appears that this was a tragedy that could have been avoided."
 holpostel.36.a:0 "Verdomde Syndies!"
 holpostel.37.t:0 "Torture Story Leaks!"
 holpostel.37.d:0 "How it has ended up the hands of the press no-one knows, but the fact is that they somehow acquired a copy of the document sanctioning the GS III to torture the French nationals we arrested at the border not so long ago.\n\nThis will only strengthen the syndicalists in their rhetoric that the Dutch government is in fact a banana republic that is violating its own constitution. They will inevitably state that we are not even close to the democracy we portray ourselves as and that the Dutch regime will need to be replaced with a syndicalist model."

Sadly for him though, Drees and Albarda wear similar suits, and from his location the gunman is unable to recognise who is who his target is; he must take a guess. Which man should he shoot?"

 holpostel.41.d:0 "A huge crowd gathered today in Vught, demanding the prison hand over Peter Ton to them. It didn't take long for the pressure to build leading to the prison kommandant giving Ton up, resulting in him being lynched on the spot by the furious crowd. In the throes of victory, the mob have started to demand that the prison releases syndicalists imprisoned there and deliver other right-wingers to them, presumably to do the same to them!"

Their preparations are almost complete which poses a problem for our government as to how to approach them. If we let them leave it could jeopardise potential future relations with whichever non-syndicalist power is victorious in America.\n\nWithin the government, most people are advocating forfeiture of citizenship if they join the syndicalist army, as per the law; some say the Dutch expression 'prevention is better than to cure' applies here, and then there are some who think we should just let them spend their holiday in America."

The GS III, the Dutch secret service, has found out that they will be announcing a major policy change for coming year and they themselves seem rather certain that this will result in a boost of support for their movement, reinforced by the fact that the VNH is encouraging non-members to come as well. The GS III has sadly not been able to retrieve information about the said policy change.\n\nSome are saying that the ideology of the VNH is dangerous and that it would be best if we stop the landdag from occurring at all, possibly through revoking their permit to hold a rally; others say this gathering is protected by freedom of speech and should just go ahead."

First VNH leader Swart held a little inspiring cliché-speech about how much the movement had grown since he joined, but the truly interesting part came after that. Deputy leader Van Geelkerken announced a radical policy change following the failure to gain power in the election this year: it was a wide range of conservative-appeasing policies, ranging from proclaiming the VNH's support for the monarchy, to more support of free enterprise and declaring Protestantism the state religion while also curbing Catholic rights. It is almost certain that this will result in a significant loss of support of the CNA in favour of the VNH."

The mayor of The Hague wants to let the police break up the demonstration as he fears it would pose a threat to public order and the safety of the royal family. On the other hand, the VNH-opposition in the municipal council of The Hague says this is an essential part of freedom of speech and asserts that the VNH will not attack the Royal family."

Purely legally speaking however, there is no real basis to ban the paper, as it would be both contrary to freedom of the press and freedom of speech, two values that normally are respected within our country."

They released a manifesto detailing their reasoning behind this move that details how they feel misrepresented by the democratic government and how the government is unwilling to truly serve Dutch interests. This is a sign that VNH support may be greater than previously expected. While these are only officers it is probable that this sentiment is present amongst the common soldiery as well, and so some officials have proposed measures to limit VNH presence in the military."

 holpostel.66.d:0 "What many had already foreseen became reality today as a group of Catholic MPs announced that they would henceforth form the New NRKSP, or New Roman Catholic State Party, faction - the CNA quickly fell apart.\n\nBefore the confessional parties united the Catholics had always had the most loyal base, and therefore the most seats - yet in the CNA the Protestants, the smaller party in the union, were somewhat controversially calling all the shots, as per the statement.\n\nLuckily, many Protestants of multiple denominations as well as several high ranking Catholics have expressed their support for continuing the CNA, meaning that the cabinet can, thanks to our coalition with others, continue to rule."

 holpostel.67.d:0 "The CNA electoral pact was originally created to win victory in the 1937 elections, and once it failed in that goal its continued survival became increasingly precarious. Today matters came to a head as the Catholics announced their withdrawal from the pact and determination to refound their RKSP party. Shortly thereafter, former CHU members announced that they too would leave the unstable union and thus, with no alliance anymore, the ARP has returned as well. So much for united confessional politics."

 holpostel.68.t:0 "Formation of the Labour Party"
 holpostel.68.d:0 "After the 1937 victory through their 'Lijst Links', the SDAP and VDB started flirting with the idea of permanently uniting the parties into one 'Party of Labour' or 'Partij van de Arbeid' in Dutch.\n\nBy late 1941, after almost completing a successful term of coalition rule in governing the country, both the annual landdag of the SDAP and that of the VDB elected to dissolve partisan differences and found this party, with the former doing it very quietly to avoid angering more leftist members. This has resulted in the creation of a progressive juggernaut that could be a dominant force in Dutch politics for the rest of the century."

 holpostel.69.d:0 "While for the SDAP the merger was far less painless, there was certainly a lot more friction caused within the VDB. At first the right-wing of the VDB saw it out, but now after two months the current prime minister Oud has formed 'Committee Oud' with other former VDB members who feel that the PvdA has been kowtowing far too much towards social democratic views. Committee Oud has successfully negotiated a merger with the market liberal LSP, to form a more conservative liberal party that could also be a force to be reckoned with in post-Weltkrieg Dutch politics. All that is left is how the party should be named."

Now Harm Kolthek, the leader of the Dutch syndicalists, is being pursued by angry paramilitaries and he is requesting refuge in our embassy. There is a good chance that he will be killed if we do not assist him."

Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just a few hundred metres from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly, the Mexican ambassador decided that Kolthek could have his refuge, which means that according to international law, we cannot get him. The Landwacht is not officially part of the Dutch government however, and so Van Geelkerken has a choice."

 holpostel.93.t:0 "Dutch Embassy Raided!"
 holpostel.93.d:0 "After seeing us granting refuge to Kolthek the Dutch 'Landwacht' paramilitary organisation decided to assault our embassy. According to early reports, they completely trashed the building and multiple members of our diplomatic mission have been wounded. Shockingly they've even kidnapped our ambassador, supposedly to hand him over to the police for helping a fugitive. While at least he was released by the Dutch police immediately, this violation is completely outrageous!"
 holpostel.93.a:0 "48 hours to leave the country, Dutch ambassador!"
 holpostel.94.t:0 "Mexican Embassy Raided"
 holpostel.94.d:0 "The Landwacht simply assaulted the Mexican embassy upon finding out that they granted refuge to Kolthek, wounding several Mexican members of the mission in the process as well as extracting Kolthek and assuring the partial destruction of the embassy. They also, somewhat scandalously, handed the Mexican ambassador over to the police, claiming he 'was helping a fugitive'. We have released him at once, seeking to distance ourselves from this controversial deed by the Landwacht.\n\nIn any case, having successfully arrested Kolthek makes it unlikely that the moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop will be capable of working together in a revolt. Our sources already state that they are currently taking over a coastguard vessel to sail to the syndicalist sphere while the Red Front and moderates began to engage in brutal infighting."

Conveniently for the syndicalist, the villa was just one block away from the Mexican embassy, the only country with ties to syndicalism that has a diplomatic mission in the Netherlands. Sadly for Kolthek, they didn't want to grant him refuge, and as such the Landwacht arrested him. Now it seems highly unlikely that any leftist revolt in the short term will succeed, as moderate Sneevliet and radical Wijnkoop do not get along so well and the orthodox syndicalists were a binding factor. Our intelligence has suggested that both are now fleeing Groningen by boat into exile as the Red Front and moderates descend into acrimony."

Unrest is growing in the rest of the country too, and some in the government are saying that it would be wise to set up a government in exile ready to restore rightful Dutch rule in case of collapse.

Military hotheads are proposing that we invade right now, while they still lack international recognition, but the Dutch, or Batavians as they call themselves now, are surely dug in having expected this move already. Others propose that we send agents to undermine the new regime's stability, which could be a more subtle way of securing their loyalty. The third possibility is to just leave them alone, at the current they seem unsupported by the International and even if they would join that alliance, what harm can the Netherlands do?"

 holpostel.122.d:0 "With the ascension of the worker's state in the Netherlands, the situation of Dutch Guyana, also known as Suriname, is becoming an embarrassing affair: it does not fit a modern worker's nation to maintain an archaic testament of imperialism. While there does not seem to be a very extensive independence movement in the region, likely due to the lacking development of the area, proposals have been pitched to send the exiled independence activist Anton de Kom back to Paramaribo to establish a socialist republic in Suriname."

They believe that if the merchant fleet is unable to operate, our country will be reduced to poverty. They want to emphasise the need of our navy to protect the fleet with fast surface ships, and if possible, harass the fleet of potential adversaries with submarines.\n\nArguments to focus on large surface ships to protect our vital colonies from a potential Japanese incursion are also heard. Our capital ships are reaching a respectable vintage and will probably not be able to protect the Dutch East Indies in particular if they are not modernised or even expanded in number.\n\nSome propose the Dutch navy to focus on naval aviation, a relatively new but potentially radically altering the way how naval battles are fought in the future.

One of the first orders of business is whether to allow the SDAP to partake in the upcoming elections; most other remnants of bourgeois elitism may not, but the SDAP have once before tried to jumpstart the revolution, granting them some measure of grudging respect amongst other leftist groups.

 holfocus.29.d:0 "A large problem is that a lot of old-guard officers in our military are members of the VNH on behalf of their 'moderate-but-still-authoritarian' faction. This undermines the reliability of our military and makes a putsch by the VNH possible. We are determined to change this, and more so by altering their party rules."

 holfocus.30.t:0 "VNH Rally Negotiations"
 holfocus.30.d:0 "One of the most important reasons that the VNH is growing so fast in recent years is that Van Geelkerken is holding enormous party rallies propagating a future under the VNH.

 holfocus.41.d.a:0 "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, which amounts to de-facto recognition of our existence, something they have not shown before. It could be a chance to make sure our citizens have some place to turn to when in the Netherlands, but our sources have told us that they agreed to do this only by the grace of having negotiated with their local syndicalists, so we could perhaps extract more."
 holfocus.41.d.b:0 "The Dutch government has grudgingly approached us to exchange diplomatic missions between our countries, though they have said that this amounts to no recognition of our government at all. This is insulting, but our sources say this move stems from negotiations with our comrades there, so perhaps we could pressure them into recognising our government."

 holfocus.42.a:0 "I still don't like this."
 holfocus.43.t:0 "France Demands De-Jure Recognition"
 holfocus.43.d:0 "The French have said that they will only accept our proposal if we officially recognise their government, something objectively not possible without repealing our recognition of [NFA.GetNameDef]. Besides that, it also makes our government look weak. Not doing it might jeopardise our deal with the left though..."

 holfocus.45.t:0 "네덜란드의 인정거부"
 holfocus.45.d:0 "Despite our pressure, the Dutch have refused to recognise us. While this means no diplomatic missions it is not particularly crushing for us.

 holfocus.52.t:0 "Dutch Cave In"
 holfocus.52.d:0 "Following our pressure the Dutch have caved in and German property will not be nationalised.

 holfocus.53.d:0 "Our 'partners', the VNH, have publicly denounced the way we handled the German diplomatic row, saying that we failed to do what it took to serve our country's best interest and that we let the German violate our sovereignty. So much for our deal."

 holfocus.54.d:0 "Following the failure to negotiate a deal with either the left or the right, the CNA and LSP are both polling at historically low levels, with most of their voters having defected to the SDAP and VDB. At the same time, the far left and far right are intending to boycott the elections. The LSP has sought to return to the negotiating table, but the CNA claims the time for talk is over. It turns out they couldn't get out."

 holfocus.55.t:0 "[GetYear]년 선거"
 holfocus.55.d:0 "Following the fall of the Cabinet of the CNA and LSP, elections were ordered to be held. The SDAP and VDB are said to stand a good chance as their interventions have caused the CNA and LSP to lose a lot of support and their bad experience with working with the democratic parties had caused both the VNH and the RSAP to boycott the elections, at least this time around."

Two pilots were protected against turnover injuries by means of a pylon built into the structure of the aircraft set behind the seat. Fuel was housed in a 77-gallon tank located aft of the engine, wing-mounted auxiliary fuel tanks could also be installed.\n\nThe main armament consisted of two pairs of 7.92mm M36 FN-Browning machine guns, two being housed within the wings and the other pair within the forward fuselage, requiring the latter to shoot through the propeller blades; guns installed within the fuselage carried 500 rounds each while wing-mounted guns had 300 rounds each.\n\nUpon its entry to service in 1938, the D.XXI represented a significant leap forward for the Dutch Army Aviation Group, whose fighter force had until that time consisted of ageing biplanes with open cockpits. The new Fokker quickly proved to be an extremely sturdy aircraft, being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive."

The LVA is thus currently in no condition to defend the skies of the Netherlands, let alone our far flung colonial empire.\n\nFokker has once again been chosen to provide the machines for our air force, and has a near production ready prototype of the Fokker D.XXI ready.\n\nUpon its entry to service the D.XXI shall represent a significant leap forward for the LVA.\n\nThe new Fokker possess some interesting characteristics like being an extremely sturdy yet manoeuvrable aircraft and being capable of attaining a speed of 700 km/h in a dive.\n\nHowever its engine might be underpowered and the twin rifle calibre machineguns might prove to be underwhelming compared to the competition."

Although the plane is well liked by its pilots, it does have some room for improvements.\n\nSeveral design changes have been proposed, and one redesigned model with an upgraded engine and retractable landing gear is now ready for production.\n\nThis will provide a cheap boost to the combat worthiness of the Luchtvaartafdeling, as existing production lines can be used."

 holfocus.401.dxxiii.d:0 "The Fokker D.XXI planes are serving us well, but their limited engine power means their obsolescence is nearing quickly. Fortunately, Fokker has been designing a replacement in the form of the twin-engine D.XXIII. With two engines instead of one and thus double the horsepower, our pilots should definitely get the advantage of enemy designs.\n\nThe Fokker D.XXIII is to be equipped with two 7.92mm calibre machineguns along with two 13mm guns, more than doubling the firepower of the previous designs."
