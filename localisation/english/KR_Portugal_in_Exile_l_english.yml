We cannot hold on the continent any more, as the enemy forces are overwhelming ours, swiftly advancing over our lands with little we can do about it.

 portugal_exile.13.d.noretreat:0 "With enemy forces approaching Lisbon, the Portuguese government has begun to collapse. They have nowhere to flee, no colonial holdings that their leaders could disembark. In short, they have been cornered, and thus must face their fate along with the rest of their European citizens."
 portugal_exile.13.d.noangola:0 "With enemy forces approaching Lisbon, the Portuguese government has decided that their position was unsustainable, and given the relative protection of the Lisbon port and the cover of the Portuguese navy, they have embarked into their ships with as many soldiers and loyalist followers they could transport and fled into exile. The only place they can do so are their Atlantic holdings, a weak place from which to hope for an eventual return to the continent. Thus the future of the Portuguese nation remains uncertain."

With morale collapsing, many of our soldiers and officers have begun deserting, asking for official pardons to the invaders in order to return to Portugal itself. Our government's position has become unsustainable, and the few ministers left still loyal to us have suggested that we should march into exile to a neutral nation to avoid capture, now that we cannot defend ourselves from those who would seek to unfairly judge us."
