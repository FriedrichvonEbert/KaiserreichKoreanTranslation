Therefore, our envoy, who will be leaving from Mozambique where he will be joined by a representative from Natal, will also request formal recognition by the Empire and seek official reinforcement.

This threshold was never hit because of the huge disparity, but over the years, native reserve lands shrunk heavily and the reserves have become overcrowded, forcing their inhabitants to similarly overcrowded slums in the urban areas under poor conditions. Now that we are no longer bound to South Africa's legislation, voices have risen to rectify these measures.\n\nHowever a lot of the forfeited reserve lands have been bought by White farmers, and not all of those are willing to vacate their property when the government offers to buy it. Expropriation is an option, but it wouldn't be popular if we expropriate whites in the interest of the natives, so some in the government say we should only recover land voluntarily."

However, many high-ranking party members, among them party leader Godfrey Huggins, actually subscribe to conservative thought.\n\nHaving won the first elections of independent Southern Rhodesia has rushed this issue to the breaking point: a cabinet now needs to be formed, and it seems likely that Godfrey Huggins will become prime minister. The question is then, whether Huggins will extend an olive branch to the left wing for the good of party unity, or if he will simply only appoint ministers that support his own position."
 zim.6.a:0 "Both wings deserve representation!"
 zim.6.b:0 "The left wing is misguided!"
 zim.7.t:0 "Complaints from Reform's Left Wing"
 zim.7.d:0 "The left wing of the Reform Party is growing increasingly dissatisfied: with prime minister Huggins' refusal to appoint left wing ministers in his cabinet, the left wing of the Reform Party has been deprived of most of its influence on the executive and thus government policy.\n\nLead by the wing's leader Thomas Nangle, progressive Reform Party MPs are now up in arms, and threatening to block government legislation if they are not satisfied with it with the Labour Party and the Rhodesia Party."
 zim.7.a:0 "Let them scream!"
 zim.8.t:0 "The prime minister seeks to dissolve Parliament"
 zim.8.d:0 "The Reform Party is quickly tearing itself apart, as left wing opposition to the government of their own party grows increasingly resolute and hinders the government's ability to pass policy severely.\n\nRecognising that this current situation is untenable, the prime minister has contacted the Rhodesia Party opposition and come to an agreement: his conservative wing will leave the Reform party and form a 'United Rhodesia Party' with the Rhodesia Party, led by Huggins.\n\nSeeing an opportunity in this newfound cooperation to wipe out the progressive reform opposition, the prime minister now petitions the governor to dissolve the Southern Rhodesian Parliament and write new elections. However, it is also clear that the combination right Reform and the Rhodesia Party already have a majority in the current mandate which has been elected just a few months ago..."

As is tradition, all Southern Rhodesians who fulfil the property qualifications can vote. It is widely expected that the new United Rhodesia Party will win in a landslide, but the Labour Party and the now much smaller leftover of the Reform Party have been campaigning viciously in the hopes of perhaps enabling themselves to deny this new political behemoth a majority and form a Labour-led coalition between the two parties instead."

The largest plurality belongs to the reform party, who are going to try to form a cabinet as such. The Reform Party has both a left and a right wing though, and unsurprisingly the former wants to form a cabinet with the Labour Party and the latter wants one with the Rhodesia Party. It has devolved into a personal conflict between the party leader Godfrey Huggins and leader of the left Reformists Thomas Nangle. If the latter wins the day, the former will likely not be party leader any longer..."

 zim.10.b:0 "Huggins wins the day!"
 zim.11.t:0 "Formation of the United Party"
 zim.11.d:0 "The coalition between the Rhodesia Party and the Reform Party has been quite beneficial and agreeable to both sides. So much so in fact, that the two parties have announced today that they will unite into a single party: the United Rhodesia Party, under the leadership of prime minister Huggins. The left wing of the Reform party has soundly rejected this notion and claims it will continue what the Reform Party stands for, but they are powerless to stop the government, whose single bloc has a comfortable majority."
 zim.11.a:0 "Hurrah for the United Party!"
 zim.12.t:0 "Huggins steps down as Party Leader"
 zim.12.d:0 "Following the disappointing result for the Reform Party, their leader Godfrey Huggins stepped down as both party leader and official leader of the opposition.\n\nThe Reform party gathered in Bulawayo to elect a new leader for the party, and the choice has fallen on Thomas Nangle, who has been the foremost left-wing MP in the party so far.

It appears European settlers in Africa, who since the fall of the British Empire have been forced to live under German rule, have now decided to throw their lot in with the new nation of Rhodesia.\n\nAmendments are already being made to the Northern Initiative, in an attempt to attract more Europeans who have settled in Africa, and a radical expansion of the Initiative is being drafted. The expansion of the Initiative has taken shape of mandatory military service for 2 years, with housing, and services provided to their family. Oddly, there also seems to be exclusions if one isn't deemed to be fit for military service, or has a skill set that is sort after by the Government. This \"skill set\" is undefined within the Initiative's draft, with its opponents pointing out that one could be able to carry a bucket, and if the Government deems that a sort after skill set, then they are excluded."

The Northern Initiative Expansion Scheme was further kneecapped with the opponents of the Scheme successfully filling in the gap that was created via the lack of skill set definition within the draft. Though it isn't all bad news, with a younger generation of Europeans making the trek to settle in Rhodesia, with them being happily welcomed"

To ensure that these emergency works would be carried out smoothly, the city of Salisbury brought forward a ban against striking, curtailing the power of the powerful railway unions, with the Rhodesian Railway Worker’s Union at its head. The latter contests that Salisbury had the right to do this on the grounds of the Union of South Africa’s Industrial Conciliation Act of 1924, which encompassed Southern Rhodesia but has not been formally repealed, and took to the judiciary to make its point.\n\nThis first decision is doubly important because not only will it reveal whether South African law passed while Southern Rhodesia was under South African dominion still holds, it also sets a precedent on how the newly autonomous colony will be handling the traditionally so powerful railway unions.
