 SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc:0 "러시아는 우리가 이 나라를 해방할 무렵에야 겨우 봉건제를 넘어서기 시작했습니다. 소비에트 공화국의 새로운 경제 정책은 농업 시스템 전반을 뿌리 뽑는일 없이 가난한 농민들이 단결하여 자원을 한데 모을 수 있게 하는 자발적인 농장 집산화 계획을 포함하여야 합니다."
 SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation:0 "공업화 진행"
 SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The superindustrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing much issues in its path."
 SOV_Control_The_Unions:0 "노동조합 통제"
 SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc:0 "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."
 SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation:0 "관료주의 혁파"
 SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc:0 "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant fight, something Lenin already understood. We will have to fight the bureaucracy, before it can establish itself already, something we have to avoid at all costs. We will also have to train truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the reactionary bureaucrats we still have plenty of."
 SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard:0 "혁명전위대"
 SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc:0 "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, he is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards socialism."
 SOV_Mass_Collectivisation:0 "대중 집산화"
 SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc:0 "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar and the capitalist. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of rapid collectivisation of our farms. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."
 SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour:0 "노동의 군대화"
 SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc:0 "Man, at its basis, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion ato establish a society based around the interests of the labouring majority. Labour armies will be established, mobilising the proletariat to work under military supervision. We must also fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."
 SOV_Proletarian_Revolution:0 "프롤레타리아 혁명"
 SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."
 SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan:0 "새로운 5개년 계획"
 SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The taxation of the peasantry and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created, which is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation."
 SOV_Industrial_Democracy:0 "산업민주주의"
 SOV_Industrial_Democracy_desc:0 "Kollontay's vision for union control over the economy has succeeded in winning over a majority of comrades. Despite her noble ancestry, she has always been a fighter for more control of unions and thus workers over the economy, as unions are the best representation of the will of the proletariat."
 SOV_Break_The_Smychka:0 "스미치카 혁파"
 SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc:0 "봉건주의와 자본주의가 수세기간 지배해온 러시아에는 진정한 의미의 소작농이 거의 없습니다. 그들 잘못은 아니지만, 농민들은 결코 혁명의 중심이 될 수 없을 것입니다. 아니, 혁명의 선봉에 설 것은 농민이 아니라 노동자이며, 그렇게 만들어야만 합니다."
 SOV_Create_the_VSR:0 "VSR 창설"
 SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc:0 "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."
 SOV_Separation_Of_Powers:0 "권력 분립"
 SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc:0 "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Country:0 "국가 재건"
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Country_desc:0 "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory. The process of rebuilding the country will be a long and difficult one, and one that we must focus all our efforts towards."
 SOV_Help_The_People:0 "인민들을 돕다"
 SOV_Help_The_People_desc:0 "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the Civil War, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy:0 "행정망 재건"
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."
 SOV_Allow_Small_Traders:0 "소규모 무역 허용"
 SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc:0 "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."
 SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan:0 "러시아 국가전기화위원회"
 SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc:0 "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.' To fulfil this plan we have entrusted a 'State Commission for Electrification of Russia' to electrify the entire nation."
 SOV_Form_Gosplan:0 "소비에트 국가재건계획위원회"
 SOV_Form_Gosplan_desc:0 "In order to complete our economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. Employing the some of the brightest minds in Russia, Gosplan will greatly enhance our economy."
 SOV_Mechanisation:0 "기계화"
 SOV_Mechanisation_desc:0 "The industrial revolution brought with it great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."
 SOV_Khozraschyot:0 "경제적 회계"
 SOV_Khozraschyot_desc:0 "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."
 SOV_Promote_Industrialisation:0 "산업화를 촉진"
 SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc:0 "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."
 SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution:0 "혁명전파"
 SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."
 SOV_Secure_Central_Asia:0 "Secure Central Asia"
 SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc:0 "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring socialist leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defense on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."
 SOV_The_Final_Battle:0 "최후의 결전"
 SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc:0 "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."
 SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias:0 "도시 민병대 동원"
 SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc:0 "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birthland. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."
 SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units:0 "적위대"
 SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units_desc:0 "Many members of the Bolshevik Party are still in hiding. We must mobilise and organise these people into military formations, as we need every soldier we can at this point if we want to survive the incoming onslaught."
 SOV_Rally_The_Defectors:0 "반동분자 재교육"
 SOV_Rally_The_Defectors_desc:0 "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."
 SOV_The_War_Effort:0 "조직화된 전쟁"
 SOV_The_War_Effort_desc:0 "We will need to organise the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War."
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army:0 "새로운 붉은 군대"
 SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army will have to be rebuilt, if we want to win this revolution. A centralised army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, and it will be a capable one the second time around too. Even so, we must be aware of the failures and mistakes of its first incarnation."
 SOV_Centralised_Command:0 "명령 중앙화"
 SOV_Centralised_Command_desc:0 "A centralised command is necessary in military combat - any other alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs. Thus, we will aim to create a cohesive military chain of command, to allow for a more effective fighting force."
 SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka:0 "국가반혁명대처특수위원회"
 SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka_desc:0 "The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission carried out its duties with diligence. Now that socialist rule has been established, however, we face the threat of subversion from counter-revolutionaries from across the world. In order to fend off the threats both from within and from abroad we must expand the institution and modernise its methods."
 SOV_War_Communism:0 "전시공산주의"
 SOV_War_Communism_desc:0 "We must take multiple measures to win this war and to spread the revolution to Russia, however unpopular and brutal many of these may prove to be. They are necessary to win the war and improve the life of the general population in the long-term."
 SOV_The_Second_Red_Army:0 "두번째 붉은군대"
 SOV_The_Second_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army must be rebuilt, as it was a great display of proletarian power, even if it was defeated at the end. However, the solution is to rebuild the Red Army and learn from its failure, not to reject the Red Army and the principles it was founded on."
 SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production:0 "무기생산 조직화"
 SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production_desc:0 "The current state of armament production is a disaster. We must reorganise the armament production and end the chaos in the production chain. Only if we do this we can guarantee that every soldier will have a gun to fight the forces of reaction."
 SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps:0 "인민의 보급대"
 SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps_desc:0 "We must properly organise our logistics. In order to do this, we will create the 'People's Logistic Corps,' which will be in charge of the supply chains, hopefully improving the current state of our logistics - in many areas, a total disaster."
 SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions:0 "전문적인 포병"
 SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions_desc:0 "We will create independent artillery battalions, which will serve to support our troops and break the enemy lines with waves of artillery shells, preventing them from launching any effective counter-attacks."
 SOV_Local_Workshops:0 "지역 작업장"
 SOV_Local_Workshops_desc:0 "We will create local workshops all throughout the nation, to allow for local arms production, which is better suited to serve the local situation and needs than a centralised way of organising the production."
 SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya:0 "국가 근위대에 권한을"
 SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_desc:0 "We must create a bottom-up army structure - an army which is truly representative of the revolutionary spirit. We will support the democratic election of commanders, even if it may cause some issues at times - the soldiers in the field probably know better who should command them than our leaders, far away from the situation."
 SOV_Decentralised_Structure:0 "지방분권된 구조"
 SOV_Decentralised_Structure_desc:0 "We must further decentralise the revolutionary army of ours, giving every part of the chain considerable autonomy and preventing the higher-ups from being able to dictate to the rest of the chain what they should do and how."
 SOV_Reconnaissance_Units:0 "수색부대"
 SOV_Reconnaissance_Units_desc:0 "By creating units dedicated to reconnaissance we will always be one step ahead of the enemy. We will know what their next plan is and what we need to do to counter-act it."
 SOV_Officer_Initiative:0 "일선장교 자율권"
 SOV_Officer_Initiative_desc:0 "Encouraging officers to make their own decisions autonomously will allow for better responses to sudden changes, as they are more knowledgeable about the situation on the ground than some far away higher-ups, who never visited the area properly."
 SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics:0 "분대전술"
 SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics_desc:0 "Instead of using masses of troops, using small units allows for us to be far quicker in our attacks and surprise than if we use large waves of soldiers. This will also give us more easily the element of surprise."
 SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan:0 "프룬제의 개혁계획"
 SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan_desc:0 "With the revolution secured, for now, we can focus on other matters. Frunze has proposed that we should focus on improving the high command and officer training and generally improve the defence of the army against a possible invasion, a real threat, as the forces of reaction will probably try to end the revolution in the future."
 SOV_Expand_The_High_Command:0 "최고사령부 확장"
 SOV_Expand_The_High_Command_desc:0 "The high command will need to be expanded to include many of the best generals we have, who were all able to show their skill in the Second Russian Revolution. Only a high command truly including the best of the best will be able to do intelligent decisions."
 SOV_Officer_Training_Academies:0 "장교사관학교"
 SOV_Officer_Training_Academies_desc:0 "Our military academies are in many ways still a relic of the past, with most being from the time of the Tsar. We will create a series of new military academies, following the best doctrine, not the most traditional doctrine. Only this way we will create an officer corps, which is truly superior to the ones of the capitalists."
 SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps:0 "전문적인 공병대"
 SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps_desc:0 "Our army still lacks a proper engineer corps, at least a formalised one. We will change this situation by creating a formal engineer corps, which will be professionally trained in their craft."
 SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan:0 "투하쳅스키의 개혁계획"
 SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan_desc:0 "Tukhachevskiy has proposed to use the doctrine of deep battle, which proposes the use of combined arms and overwhelming land-air attacks. Such a doctrine would make the army a true force to be reckoned with on the offensive."
 SOV_Mass_Breakthroughs:0 "집단 돌격"
 SOV_Mass_Breakthroughs_desc:0 "Armour is the future, we will need to support the development of new tanks if we want to create a truly modern arm force, which is able to encircle and destroy enemy divisions at record speeds."
 SOV_Land_Air_Integration:0 "육공 합동"
 SOV_Land_Air_Integration_desc:0 "The integrated use of soldiers and aircraft will allow for the overwhelming of the troops and for our army to crush the enemy completely."
 SOV_Establish_The_VVS:0 "VVS창설"
 SOV_Establish_The_VVS_desc:0 "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."
 SOV_Airspace_Defence:0 "영공방위"
 SOV_Airspace_Defence_desc:0 "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our airspace and terrorise the land troops, something we will have to avoid at all costs if we want to be victorious in future encounters."
 SOV_The_ORT_System:0 "ORT시스템"
 SOV_The_ORT_System_desc:0 "Modern wars are only partially won on the battlefield. Equally important are the men and women behind desks and radios, dealing with intelligence and transmissions. We need to make their work easier."
 SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry:0 "항공산업 국유화"
 SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc:0 "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, however often it is still private. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry and integrate it into the state apparatus if we want to create a modern and strong air force."
 SOV_Aviation_Bureaus:0 "항공국"
 SOV_Aviation_Bureaus_desc:0 "Opening aviation bureaus throughout the nation will allow us to improve our pilots, something which is always an important duty of the nation, if we want to create a capable air force."
 SOV_New_Fighters:0 "새로운 전투기"

However, [SOV.GetNameDef] will need time to recover from the devastation of the civil war, a time we must use to extend our protection to any countries endangered by the new regime.\n\nPoland, Finland and the Caucasus all stand unprotected - we must do whatever we can to protect them, lest they fall to the incoming Russians."

 russoc.105.d:0 "For years, the course of events during the October Revolution have been a mystery to the world and the general population. The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."

 russoc.106.t:0 "Farmers Begin to Burn Livestock En Masse"
 russoc.106.d:0 "The government's program of mass collectivisation, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialise in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the program of collectivisation to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivised, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivisation of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivisation and has generally destabilised our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialise the nation."

 russoc.107.d:0 "The spectre of collectivisation seems to have also now entered the mind of children throughout the republic, as a [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] form has Cowboys and Indians has become popular, known as 'Search and Requisition.' In this game, there are two teams: kulaks hiding grain and requisitioning brigades intending to requisition the grain. The [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has encouraged this, seeing it as a possibility to increase the influence of Socialists among the children."

 russoc.108.t:0 "Reds and Whites"
 russoc.108.d:0 "A truly socialist courtyard game has become popular among children, the game in question being called 'Reds and Whites', a truly socialist form of Cowboys and Indians, where the Cowboys are the Reds and the Indians the Whites. The game has become so popular in fact that companies have begun to sell air-guns explicitly for Reds and Whites, with those guns being very popular among children too. The government has strongly supported this, seeing it as a way to mould the youth to be more open to Socialism even in the future."

 russoc.109.t:0 "Change in Family Rules Result in Spike in Divorce Rates"
 russoc.109.d:0 "While many revolutionaries had a religious background or learned at religious schools, they do not have a good opinion on the Church in general, seeking to break the Orthodox Church and its influence on the Russian society both legally and through their public influence. However, while curbing their cultural influence will take out longer, the government has begun eroding the influence of the Orthodox Church legally.\n\nThe [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has begun measures to take away the control and forming of marriages away from the Church and making it a civil affair of the government, they also greatly simplified divorce, where it is now a simple matter of registration, instead of the former hard process in Tsarist and Republican Russia.\n\nHowever, while this has greatly improved the mobility of women to leave abusive families, it also resulted in a massive spike of divorce rates on a level never seen before, with the divorce rate being the highest in the world now, thanks to divorce being this easy now."

 russoc.110.t:0 "Begin of Latinisation of Languages"
 russoc.110.d:0 "As socialism seeks to unite humanity and wither away states in the future, many in the government have proposed that the [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government should begin Latinising the languages in its nations, as the Cyrillic alphabet would impend communication between Western Europe and Russia and the people compromising it, among others. However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the amount of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the land compromising this nations. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoly Lunacharsky, who is known for his more unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious groups."

 russoc.111.t:0 "Formation of the Young Pioneers"
 russoc.111.d:0 "The Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organisation has recently been founded, after a long conflict between the Komsomol and the scout movement was decided in the favour of the scout movement, who wanted an independent organisation, while Konsomol wanted to keep them integrated into the organisation, being helped by the widow of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya, who supported the cause of the scout movement against Komsomol.\n\nThe intent of the young pioneers is to further integrate the youth into the state machinery, swearing an oath to 'to stand firmly for the cause of our Communist Party.' While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organisation, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the young pioneers.\n\nThe routine of the young pioneers consist out of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs; which has given the young pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as it gives many in the youth, who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."

They were barred from numerous prestigious positions and would often struggle to advance in their career. The decay of order in the country and the growth of socialism left many of them sympathising with their cause, and now, with the Second Civil War going ahead, they have defected from their ranks and switched their sides to their brothers-in-arms in Moscow.\n\nImmediately, these brave heroes received commissions in the Red Army and will lead us to victory!"
