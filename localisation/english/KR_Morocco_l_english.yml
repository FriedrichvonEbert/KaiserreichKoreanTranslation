 mor.1.t:0 "모로코의 역사"
 mor.1.d:0 "1904년, 프랑스와 스페인은 모로코로 세력을 뻗쳤습니다. 프랑스의 동맹인 영국의 인정은 독일 제국의 거센 반발을 불러왔고, 1905년에 위기가 닥쳐왔습니다. 이 문제는 1906년 알헤시라스 회의에서 해결되었습니다. 1911년 아가디르 위기는 유럽 강대국들 사이의 긴장을 고조시켰습니다. 1912년 페스 조약은 모로코를 프랑스의 보호국으로 만들고, 대폭동을 유발했습니다. 같은 조약으로 스페인은 북쪽과 남쪽 사하라 지역에서 이익대표국의 역할을 맡았습니다. 세계대전 때 베르베르족의 자이안 연합이 프랑스에 대한 반란을 일으켜 충분한 동맹국의 지원을 받았지만 프랑스가 정복될 때까지 이렇다 할 승리를 거두지 못했습니다. 왕위를 주장하는 여러 사람이 독일 제국과 협상을 시도하는 동안 그들은 결론을 내리지 못했고, 마침내 모하메드 5세가 아버지가 퇴위한 후 왕위에 올랐습니다. 새로운 술탄은 프랑스의 보호국 시절보다 매우 줄어든 영향력을 끼치는 독일과 새로운 조약을 맺었습니다. 그 조약은 가능한 한 우호적이기 위해 신중히 작성되었습니다. 그러나 가끔 긴장이 고조되어 독일의 지원을 받은 왕실 근위대가 개입해야 할 때가 있습니다. 30년대가 으르렁거리며 모로코는 보호국 시대에서 벗어났지만, 일부 국민주의자들이 모로코 독립을 위해 독일 제국과의 동맹 강화를 지지할 정도로 알제와의 관계는 매우 냉랭합니다. 술탄은 보복주의적인 알제리의 프랑스 엘리트들뿐만 아니라 모로코를 아프리카와 이슬람 세계로의 혁명의 관문으로 보는 파리의 야만적인 혁명가들로부터 모로코를 보호해야 합니다."
