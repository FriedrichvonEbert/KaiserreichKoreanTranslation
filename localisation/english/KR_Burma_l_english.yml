 burma.0.t:0 "전쟁으로 분단된 국가"
 burma.0.d:0 "In 1921, when the Indian Revolution went into full swing, Burma was quick to follow. By 1925, independence had been de facto won with the Indian Civil War coming to a stalemate. Independence had been won - but peace was far-off, with the country in a quasi-civil war between the various minorities and the central government in Rangoon. In 1928, after a skirmish on the south east border, the Kingdom of Siam invaded and a year long bloody war followed. The Treaty of Moulmein, negotiated by Germany and Japan, brought an end to the conflict but ceded Lower Shan to Siam and left the occupation of Moulmein and lower Burma undecided. Humiliated, Chit Hlaing's GCBA government collapsed at the 1930 elections and U Ba Pe's Nationalist Party won in a tight victory. In the 1935, U Ba Pe and his reformed People's Party won another victory, against the backdrop of allegations of corruption and fraud. Since then, U Ba Pe has struggled to cement his rule against an increasingly radical and politically demanding populace. All the while, India waits for an opportunity to spread the revolution east. When the day comes, will Burma be ready?"
 burma.0.a:0 "우리는 이러한 힘든 시기를 함께 이겨내야한다!"
 burma.1.t:0 "랑군 대학으로부터의 폭동과 항쟁"
 burma.1.d:0 "Dissatisfaction with corruption in the government, the immense patronage systems permeating civic life and U Ba Pe's unscrupulous rule has sparked some of the greatest demonstrations seen in our country since independence was achieved in 1925. Stemming from the great and prestigious Rangoon University, radicalised leftist students have occupied several administrative buildings and held rallies denouncing the president and his wealthy backers as being corrupt and detrimental to the welfare of the nation. Still, the demonstrators haven't managed to garner the support of the industrial workers and rural farmers, restricting the budding movement to the intelligentsia."
 burma.1.a:0 "지휘봉과 세이버 검을 보내라!"
 burma.2.t:0 "랑군 대학으로부터의 폭동과 항쟁"
 burma.2.d:0 "In neighbouring Burma, riots are spreading among a political impotent youth, protesting against the rampant corruption at Rangoon University, at the lack of reform and at the illegitimate rule of president U Ba Pe. For now the demonstrations have been restricted to Rangoon, but the inactivity of the current regime might spell another outburst in the months to come, especially with workers at the oil fields in Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu rumbling about lousy pay and poor living conditions. Should the two fractions unite, we might find ourselves with a friendly government on the other side of the Bay of Bengal."
 burma.2.a:0 "버마인들을 계속 지켜봐라!"
 burma.3.t:0 "예난자웅 유전에서의 파업"
 burma.3.d:0 "예난자웅, 차우크, 그리고 민부 유전에서 일하는 노동자들은 부패한 정부와 그들의 낮은 생활 수준에 반대하며 심각한 파업을 시작했습니다.경찰과 예비군은 유전을 장악하고 붉은 깃발을 흔들며 반-사회주의적 노래를 부르는 시위자들을 몰아내는데 완전히 실패했습니다. 그들의 요구를 달랠 무언가를 제공하여, 나머지 지역에서의 추가적인 시위 확산을 막아야합니다."
 burma.3.a:0 "건방진 녀석!! 노동자들의 움직임은 곧 붕괴될 것이다!"
 burma.3.b:0 "그들을 달래기 위해 시도해보아라..."
 burma.4.t:0 "1300년 혁명 발생!"
 burma.4.d:0 "Catastrophe! Just like in 1936, students from Rangoon University has risen up against the presidency in critical demonstrations and protests. However, this year the radicalised student leaders have joined cause with the equally disgruntled oil workers, giving the movement a truly national scope. As the insurgents march on Rangoon, only a firm military reaction will solve this hopeless situation!"
 burma.4.a:0 "상상할 수 없는 일이다, 군대를 보내 대학생들을 진압하라!"
 burma.4.b:0 "대통령은 암살됐고 임시 정부가 수립됐다!"
 burma.5.t:0 "시위대를 향해 발포 준비를 마친 군대"
 burma.5.d:0 "마치 영원할 것 같았던 일이 있은 후, 시위는 마침내 랑군 대학교의 학생들과 버마군 사이의 분쟁으로 귀결되었습니다. 파업 중인 유전 노동자들의 행진이 수도를 향해 오고 있다는 정보가 현지 지휘관에게 전달되었고, 시위대를 날이 저물도록 해산시키지 못했기 때문에 시위대를 무슨 수를 써서도 해산시키라는 군 총참모부의 명령이 조금씩 내습니다. 버마의 운명은 촌각에 달려 있습니다..."
 burma.5.a:0 "The army mutinies and joins the revolutionaries!"
 burma.5.b:0 "Pro-government paramilitaries and the army crush the protests!"
 burma.6.t:0 "버마 사회주의 공화국을 선언하다"
 burma.6.d:0 "U Ba Pe's illegitimate republic has been driven out by a union of students, workers and the military, ushering in a provisional government under the leadership of the People's Revolutionary Party and comrade Aung San. As the revolution is complete at home, there is the question to be asked: should it be taken abroad? Practically everyone in the government wishes for Burma to align with either India or the Internationale - though we could instead opt to go it alone."
 burma.6.a:0 "Rekindle the Anti-Colonial Pact with India!"
 burma.6.b:0 "Burma shall become a revolutionary outpost!"
 burma.6.c:0 "We must focus on the revolution at home!"
 burma.7.t:0 "Burma Wishes to Rekindle the Anti-Colonial Alliance"
 burma.7.d:0 "In Burma, the corrupt U Ba Pe presidency has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter's peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Intimidated by the prospect of a possible renewed war with the Bangkok-based Chakri monarchy intervening on the side of the disenfranchised landowners, this new Burmese constellation has approached us with an offer of alliance, securing themselves against foreign involvement and gaining us a secure border to the East. Calcutta will have to answer swiftly and unequivocally lest this opportunity slip out of our hands."
 burma.7.a:0 "환영하네 군대와 사회주의자 동지들!"
 burma.7.b:0 "Burma would just drag us into a war we cannot afford!"

 burma.8.d:0 "In Burma, the corrupt U Ba Pe presidency has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter's peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Be it that they wish to help advance the international revolution or simply seek protection from stronger powers, they have petitioned us for entrance into the Internationale. How shall we respond?"
 burma.8.a:0 "우리는 그들과 함께 할 것이며, 함께 저항할 것이다!"
 burma.8.b:0 "우리는 그들의 갈등과 아무런 상관이 없다."
 burma.9.t:0 "U Maung Gyee Calls for New Elections."
 burma.9.d:0 "With the death of the much loathed president U Ba Pe, his more liberal Prime Minister U Maung Gyee has called for new and democratic elections to take place in one months time. This appears to have placated the protestors and will hopefully save Burma from more corruption and tyranny."
 burma.9.a:0 "버마는 살았다!"
 burma.10.t:0 "긴급선거"
 burma.10.d:0 "Elections have finally arrived in Burma and for once they are totally free and fair! In the running are Kodaw Hmaing's reformed Peoples' Party which wishes to hold a referendum on the monarchy, Chit Hlaing's United GCBA now promising to atone for its previous failures and Dr. Ba Maw's Poor Man's Party. Who shall win the elections?"
 burma.10.a:0 "개혁인민당!"

 burma.10.c:0 "빈곤민당!"
 burma.11.t:0 "군주제 국민투표"
 burma.11.d:0 "A royalist himself, Kodaw Hmaing had campaigned on a platform to restore the Burmese monarchy with Princess Myat Phaya Lat as regent until Prince Taw Phaya Gyi is of age to take the throne himself. With the referendum results coming in, what shall Burma be?"
 burma.11.a:0 "The Royalists win out!"
 burma.11.b:0 "버마는 공화국이다!"
 burma.12.t:0 "분쇄된 1300년 혁명"
 burma.12.d:0 "Catastrophe! Just like in 1936, students from Rangoon University has risen up against the presidency in critical demonstrations and protests. However, this year the radicalised student leaders were crushed due to lacking support of the previously striking workers. As loyalist paramilitaries put down the student uprisings, there have been talks within in the government about committing a self-coup and empowering U Ba Pe much like he has desired for years... Of course we could instead maintain the veneer of democracy and the Five Flowers Coalition."
 burma.12.a:0 "Maintain the Coalition for internal stability!"
