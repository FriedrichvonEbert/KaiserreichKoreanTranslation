 HAI_crippling_illiteracy_desc:0 "We can't deny the elephant in the room; much of Haiti remains brutally illiterate, with schools heavily underfunded and most children being sent off to work at a young age. Higher education is typically resolved for French-speaking Haitians, and few resources exist for the average Haitian - those who speak Creole. While Haiti lags behind the rest of the world already, if illiteracy is not resolved, Haiti will continue to fall behind the rest of her neighbours."

 HAI_the_old_constitution_desc:0 "The Constitution will be restored to ensure the continued stability of the regime. Under these decrees, we will ensure that power is centred in the right hands and not in the hands of an unruly mob. This will ensure the strengthening of the Mulatto class, giving control to those who will use it best.

 HAI_conservative:0 "보수적인 아이티"
 HAI_conservative_desc:0 "While Elie Lescot's conservative leanings have always been clear, the continued dominance of conservatives within what was once the political opposition to President Calixte was far from certain.

 HAI_old_constitution:0 "엣 헌법 지속"
 HAI_old_constitution_desc:0 "The Constitution of 1932 is grounded in a strong political tradition. While its idiosyncrasies receive criticism, particularly the fairly ambiguous status of the Council of State and the Senate, the document should be amended, not replaced."

 HAI_reconvene_senate_desc:0 "Under President Dartiguenave, the upper house of the national legislature, the Senate, was replaced by a temporary body for a period of one year - a mechanism enshrined in Haitian law for decades.

 HAI_question_of_guarde:0 "아이티 수비대에 대한 의문"
 HAI_question_of_guarde_desc:0 "The army has long been a source of national pride, Haiti was born from righteous struggle after all. It has also, however, long been a thorn in the side of civilian administrations. Indeed, we are only able to reverse the damage done by the Garde under Calixte's leadership. Going forward, we must ensure that the Garde is entirely under civilian supervision and reduce its societal standing."
 HAI_liberal:0 "자유주의적 아이티"
 HAI_liberal_desc:0 "Owing to his disagreements with other holdovers from the Borno days and more conservative nationalists, President Lescot has shepherded liberal nationalists to political ascendency while assuring his continued political dominance."
 HAI_attract_business:0 "매력적인 큰 사업"
 HAI_attract_business_desc:0 "The largest companies have consolidated their dominance and increasingly established networks of subsidiaries the world over. While they may not be 'Haitian' in origin, we should actively court the entry of the world's largest corporations into Haiti. By positioning ourselves as a staunch ally of such companies, we will surely benefit."

 HAI_cash_mining:0 "귀금속 광산 확대"
 HAI_cash_mining_desc:0 "The mineral wealth of our nation remains almost entirely unsurveyed.

 HAI_building_infrastructure:0 "기반시설 건설"
 HAI_building_infrastructure_desc:0 "Beyond the cities, for the transportation of goods and personnel, businesses must rely on a series of locally maintained dirt paths alone, often making use of pack animals.

 HAI_housing_projects:0 "새로운 주택 공급 계획"

 HAI_begin_electrification_desc:0 "Haiti has lagged decades behind much of the rest of the world in bringing electricity to the masses. Outside of the wealthier parts of Port-Au-Prince, electricity is the exclusive domain of the state. We must at last address this issue."
 HAI_begin_tourism:0 "관광업 개시"

 HAI_subsidize_farmers:0 "농민 보조금"
 HAI_subsidize_farmers_desc:0 "Rich nations have ramped up agricultural subsidies, flooding peripheral markets with goods. While we cannot offer our farmers such a generous largesse, we can underwrite certain farm expenses."
 HAI_expand_lumber:0 "제재업 확대"
 HAI_expand_lumber_desc:0 "Under the American occupation, lumber exports grew substantially. New forestry methods enabling the creation of vast tree plantations, however, were never put into practice. A bit of state capital is just what the lumber industry needs to transform itself into a lucrative beacon of modernity."
 HAI_rural_housing:0 "시골 주택 공급 계획"
 HAI_rural_housing_desc:0 "Many in the countryside live in squalor, jeopardising their work productivity. With state support for new housing developments in the countryside, agricultural production will surely grow greatly."

 HAI_revitalized_economy_desc:0 "The economic depression which began in 1925 and reached new lows in 1936 is at an end. Our coffers overflow with the fruits of economic prosperity. We can put this money to use, expanding, rather than cutting back on, our most successful economic initiatives."
 HAI_new_constitution:0 "새로운 헌법"
 HAI_new_constitution_desc:0 "The constitution of 1932, though steeped in tradition, represents all that is wrong with Haitian democracy and shows just how far Haiti has strayed from the ideals of its founders. An entirely new document must be drawn up mandating a more thoroughly democratic political system and reducing the power of the executive."
 HAI_parliamentary:0 "의원내각제"
 HAI_parliamentary_desc:0 "In order to preclude abuse of power, the office of the presidency should be made mostly ceremonial while most executive power is transferred to the Speaker of the National Assembly.

 HAI_presidential:0 "대통령제 공화국"
 HAI_presidential_desc:0 "The executive has proven effective in addressing national emergencies.

 HAI_dissolve_guarde:0 "아이티 수비대 해체"
 HAI_dissolve_guarde_desc:0 "The army has threatened administration after administration. While a strong border force must be maintained, the army itself, the Garde, simply must be dissolved. Let us strike the iron while it's hot and eliminate the army while it is weak."
 HAI_democratic_legislature:0 "민주적 입법부"
 HAI_democratic_legislature_desc:0 "While Haiti was perhaps the first nation to formally establish universal suffrage, the realities of Haitian democracy has seen access to the ballot box severely restricted.

 HAI_liberal_republic:0 "권력 이양"
 HAI_liberal_republic_desc:0 "To ensure that the nation is never again dominated by a core of urban elites, we must lessen the distance between the halls of power and the common people.

 HAI_mobilize_guard:0 "수비대 징집"
 HAI_mobilize_guard_desc:0 "The rank and file of the Haitian Garde remain loyal to Calixte personally. As our ranks remain largely intact in much of the country, it will require only minimal effort to organize an effective fighting force."

 HAI_democracy:0 "민주적인 헌법"

 HAI_peoples_assembly:0 "인민의 의회"
 HAI_peoples_assembly_desc:0 "The structure of the national assembly has historically favoured the political centre of Haiti - Port-Au-Prince, particularly its most famously wealthy burrows.

 HAI_lib_friends_desc:0 "While owing to their opposition to Calixte's methods and the political power of the Garde, Haiti's liberals have come into conflict with President Calixte, but they share many of the president's political goals.

 HAI_diminish_guarde_desc:0 "The Haitian army has long been the vanguard of black political power in the face of mulatto political domination. The politicisation of the army, however, could serve to derail Haitian democracy.

 HAI_workers_rights:0 "노동권 확대"
 HAI_workers_rights_desc:0 "Haiti has long oscillated between domination by foreign interests and protectionism. We should instead harness the foreign for the benefit of the people of Haiti.

 HAI_subservient_assembly:0 "굴종하는 의회"
 HAI_subservient_assembly_desc:0 "While we agree that democratic values are essential, democracy can be dangerous in these unstable times.

 HAI_institutionalize_guarde:0 "아이티 수비대 확장"
 HAI_institutionalize_guarde_desc:0 "The army has long served as the bulwark of the people against domination by the political elite.

 HAI_education_reform_desc:0 "Our country lags behind much of the Caribbean when it comes to literacy; despite the Caribbean being very much underdeveloped in education, Haiti's illiteracy rates are particularly abysmal. Under the leadership of Calixte, however, this will change. To start off our education reform, we will begin enforcing compulsory education to ensure our children will become a generation of Haitian intellectuals."
 HAI_education_spending:0 "교육 예산 인상"
 HAI_education_spending_desc:0 "Our initial education reforms have been successful! We have received word that day and day, more Haitian children are attending school, but still, this is not enough.

 HAI_state_work:0 "국영 사업 계획"
 HAI_state_work_desc:0 "With the worst of Black Monday over, many Haitians still remain unemployed. This provides the Haitian government with a free workforce, and we can use this manpower to build government projects such as government housing, infrastructure, and schools.

 HAI_infrastructure_expansion:0 "기반시설 확대"
 HAI_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "As part of our state work programs, we will take steps to build infrastructure in Haiti - most of our network consists of poorly paved roads, and in some areas roads are simply non-existent. The political turmoil of the last years has also degraded what little we had, making it difficult for our people to use them as our nation's economy rises again. We will undertake an modernisation programme to build up Haiti's infrastructure while also providing jobs for Haitians."

Ever since their unlawful occupation of the islands, Haiti has been exploited repeatedly by our giant of a neighbour.

 HAI_housing_program_desc:0 "Thanks to Black Monday and the years of political turmoil, many Haitians are out of their homes. We deeply care for the plight of our fellow Haitians, and thus we will take steps to resolve this. With aid from the government, we will begin a rigorous project to build up government housing. This way, we can provide Haitian citizens who are less fortunate with cheap accommodations and so that they can finally have a roof over their heads."
 HAI_financial_control:0 "금융통제 주장"
 HAI_financial_control_desc:0 "Our economy has long been tied to that of the United States, and it would not be out of place to say that Haiti was indeed an American puppet.

Our nation will finally unlock our economic potential; no longer will we be reliant on others!"
 HAI_mining_sector:0 "광업 구역 성장"

 HAI_new_economy:0 "신경제"
 HAI_new_economy_desc:0 "When Black Monday hit Haiti, observers believed that this would spell a decades-long doom for us and that we would never recover to a pre-depression level economy. Calixte's government has proven them wrong, and now Haiti stands more robust than ever; our economy is finally booming.

 HAI_purchase_german_arms:0 "독일 무기 구매"
 HAI_purchase_german_arms_desc:0 "The German army is the strongest in the world and has the most modern equipment. Haiti's arms industry is small, and most of our weapons come from foreign suppliers anyway. As part of the increasing German-Haitian cooperation, we will begin buying arms from the German Empire.

 HAI_attract_german_immigration:0 "독일 이민 유치"
 HAI_attract_german_immigration_desc:0 "Starting in the mid-1800s, Germans began arriving in Haiti due to our nation's limited competition and openness to free trade. While the Germans made up a minority of the Haitian population, the Americans seized German possessions during their occupation.

 POLITICS_JACQUES_ROMAIN_DESC:0 "Jacques Roumain, prolific poet, once a close associate of both liberal and Noirist writers alike, together with a close-knit group of like-minded ideologues, founded the Haitian Syndicalist Party and began the formalisation of the fragmented Haitian left. While he would alienate his liberal and Noirist once-allies in the process, the movement he created propelled him to the forefront of opposition to the authoritarian regime of Louis Borno."
 POLITICS_GEORGES_RIGAUD_DESC:0 "A leader of protests against the discriminatory policies the United States imposed upon the Haitian education system, Rigaud was beaten to an inch of his life at the hands of American Marines as a young student in Port-Au-Prince. Soon thereafter, as a leader of the burgeoning labour movement, while others within the Haitian left would embrace fully European ideas of socialism, Rigaud would instead attempt to mould syndicalist ideas to fit the unique history and culture of Haiti."
 POLITICS_LOUIS_BORNO_DESC:0 "In 1922, Louis Borno was elected in a seeming act of defiance by the Council of State against the occupying Americans. Borno, however, would prove entirely willing to not only cooperate with the United States, but work hand in hand to ensure their mutual success. During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the ageing President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."
 POLITICS_JOHN_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "General John Russell's long tenure as American Marine Commissioner for Haiti suffered only a minor hiccup with the withdrawal of American Marines from the country, with him still keeping a close eye on the affairs of Haiti's civilian government. While sympathetic to the Haitian people and holding surprisingly tolerant racial views, Russell is loyal only to the United States."
 POLITICS_FRANCK_LAVAUD_DESC:0 "Born in the west of Haiti, Franck Lavaud graduated among the top of the Military Academy and rose rapidly through the ranks of the Haitian army. Reaching the post of Chief of Staff of the Garde under Elie Lescot's presidency, he was then appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Haitian army. The commander always stayed far from politics, and is dedicated above everything else to the good of his country. This is what motivated him to move against President Lescot after his failure dealing with the Dominican Republic. The weakness of the president would have led to the weakness of Haiti, which Lavaud can't accept./ Lavaud announced already that he doesn't mean to rule for long, as he is not a politician. His main goal is to organise elections and ensure the peaceful continuity of the Haitian state. / In much the same way and despite his apolitical position, Lavaud grew to despise the factionalism riddling Haitian politics and regularly leading the country to international humiliation. The general, supported by the armed forces and a large part of the population, thus intends to suspend political life until the stability and strength of Haiti can be restored."
 POLITICS_DP_CALIXTE:0 "Colonel Démosthènes Pétrus Calixte is a black, United States-trained, Haitian commander, and the President of Haiti since 1934. Calixte and his clique took power in a context of Dominican provocations on the border, that then-President Louis Borno was not able to deal with by allowing military buildup. The departure of the last brigade of American marines allowed Demosthènes Calixte, in his role of Commander of the Garde d'Haiti, to depose the President and take power. However, despite his reformist views, Calixte was forced to oblige American demands, represented in Haiti by High-Commissioner Russell. Calixte has promised to respect the imposed financial constraints and some of the limits in trade and foreign policy. While some of his planned reforms, such as the desired army buildup plan, or the cessation of the much-hated civil conscription were able to go through, most of his other promises were stopped in Parliament. The sweeping constitutional reforms that aimed to elect the President by popular suffrage or to abolish the Council of State were constantly blocked, mostly because of the decisive influence of American money and political pressure.\n\nCalixte thus rules in an authoritarian manner, using decrees and leveraging his powerful position as both President and the Commander of the Garde to stay in place. But now, President Calixte is between a rock and a hard place. He hasn't abandoned his dreams of reforming Haiti into a democratic state free of foreign influence, but he first has to deal with the continued influence of the Americans, the corruption of many officials, and the doubtful fidelity of the political factions that aligned with him. As Calixte loses more and more control, rumours of a palace coup grow noisier. But the authority of the Commander is still strong and no person can say what his future might look like."
 POLITICS_ELIE_LESCOT:0 "President Elie Lescot was originally a pharmacist in Port-de-Paix, in the north of the country. A representative of the interests of the mulatto elite, he entered politics before the Weltkrieg and then took on several posts in the governments of Louis Borno and Demosthènes Calixte. He however never relinquished his independence, and made alliances only out of pure interest. Comforted by his favourable standing among the Americans and the Germans, Lescot was able to take power following the fall of President Calixte. Lescot now plans to bring liberal and democratic reforms to Haiti, and to dismantle the socialist-inspired policies of Calixte. The issue of constitutional reform is one that is still to be answered for the new government. As Lescot's attachment to democracy is debatable, it is unsure how much say the President plans to give to democratic institutions."
 POLITICS_STENIO_VINCENT_DESC:0 "Sténio Vincent is an old character of Haitian politics. Already active before the Weltkrieg, he was briefly the mayor of Port-au-Prince from 1907 to 1909, and was a member of Dartiguenave's government from 1916 to 1917. A member of the Conservative Party, he first supported the American occupation before radically turning against it in the 1920s. From then on, Vincent was constantly a leading figure of the opposition as the head of the Nationalistes, opposing both Louis Borno and Démosthènes Calixte for their collaboration with the American occupiers. The victory of President Vincent in the 1940 elections came as a surprise to many of the elite, but well-informed observers have known for long his popularity among the popular strata of the capital. His platform, revolving mostly around the end of American occupation and national independence, appeals to the Haitian masses who hope to one day see their country free of foreign influence."
 POLITICS_JEAN_PRICE_MARS:0 "A Haitian doctor, teacher, politician, diplomat, writer, and ethnographer, Jean Price-Mars served as secretary of the Haitian legation in Washington D.C. and as chargé d'affaires in Paris during the Weltkrieg. Taking his surname from his mulatto father and the mulatto writer Hannibal Price, Price heard stories of Haitian folklore from the earliest days of youth - giving him the respect of Haitian traditions. Price-Mars is a champion of Négritude, the belief in a shared "black" consciousness among the African diaspora, and a prominent advocate of voodoo as a complete religion.\n\nHis political ideology stems heavily from the resistance of Haitian peasants towards the American occupation, and he heavily despises the Haitian elite for their seeming ineptitude to provide for the masses. Inspired by the novel "Madame Bovary," Price-Mars coined the term "collective bovarysme" to criticize Haitian elites of mixed white ancestry whom Price-Mars blames for holding unfair economic and economic positions in the country. A critic of Haiti's crippling illiteracy, Price-Mars believes that universal education will lead to an advancement of society. Fully embracing Haiti's history of slavery, Price-Mars believes the Haitian slaves were the true source of Haiti's traditions and history. He admired the slaves' culture and religion as a base of resistance towards the European colonizers - the foundation of a Haitian nation that he seeks to emulate."

Léger has reported to us that there is some chatter in the army over whether Lescot is truly the man for the coming war against the Dominicans, or whether former President Calixte's lieutenant Paul Magloire would be more suited for the job. While this may sound dangerous, these are low-level officials, and Léger has made it clear that there is no wider discussion of a coup plot."
