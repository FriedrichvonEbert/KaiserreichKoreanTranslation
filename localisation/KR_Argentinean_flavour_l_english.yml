 arg_flavour.1.d:0 "우루과이 출신 극작가 오라시오 실베스트레 키로가 포르테사가 호세 데 산마르틴 대학병원에서 숨을 거두었습니다. 그는 전립선암 말기를 진단받았으나, 병이 더 진행되기 전에 자살을 선택하여 아르헨티나 문학계는 더욱 충격에 빠졌습니다. 아르헨티나 작가 협회 (SADE)가 장례식 준비를 하는 동안, 키로가의 열성팬들은 아르헨티나 최고의 공포, 비극 작가였던 그를 추모하기 위해 신문기사를 쓰고 있으며, 이제 '사랑, 광기, 그리고 죽음의 이야기'와 같은 책들은 아르헨티나의 고전 문학이 되었습니다."

 arg_flavour.4.d2:0 "In yet another unfortunate blow for the SADE, the modernist poet Alfonsina Storni has been found dead today. An investigation was opened on the case but it was quickly concluded as a suicide, given statements given by her acquaintances as well as evidence found on her residence and in the area where she reportedly threw herself off a breakwater into the sea in the town of Mar del Plata. Her body, found washed up on a beach by two workers, is now on its way to Buenos Aires, where funeral preparations are being prepared by the SADE as the national newspapers write about 'The Tragic Death of the Great American Poet'. With her associations to the Socialist Manuel Baldomero Ugarte were well known, she was still considered and outsider of the Revolutionary movement. Nevertheless, Ugarte has come out writing strongly about her in La Vanguardia, and rumours abound that he has even sent parting gifts for her funeral, further reinforcing the idea that both writers had been close."

 arg_flavour.7.d:0 "In a way to avoid the 1853 Constitution's article that no Argentinian government can restrict immigration, Carlés has authorised the creation of an Argentine agency dedicated to investigating and authorising the entry of immigrants to the nation, known as the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones (National Directorate of Migrations). With offices being built on several hotspots of immigration like Buenos Aires, Bariloche and Puerto Iguazu, the agency will be tasked with issuing permits for people to be allowed to work and live in Argentina. While many nationalists applaud this measure, as it's going to add a layer of screening to the migrants that have been coming to Argentina, many with questionable backgrounds, the opposition members have been outspoken about the oppressive nature of said measures, with claims that these are just blatant attempts at skirting the constitution."

 arg_flavour.8.d:0 "The Zwi Migdal, a Jewish organised crime group that had been thought to be completely disbanded in 1930, has resurfaced yet again in another public scandal. After yet another investigation, it seemed that the exile orders handed out during the latter years of the Uriburu dictatorship had been outright ignored, with members of the group returning to work in Argentina. With accusations from members of the Liga Patriótica denouncing the Jewish group, Carlés has taken the matter into his own hands and ordered the entirety of the suspect list arrested on the grounds of 'supporting human trafficking of European Christian women'. The Argentine Jewish Community, in the meantime, has now come under fire of the general public, as theories that they were protecting the group are fanning the flames of anti-semitism. However, some in the opposition have been quick to point at the many reports the Jewish community made against the group that have been seemingly ignored, as well as the apparent spread of a conspiracy theory that the Liga Patriótica purposefully ignored the exile orders of this group to fan the flames against the community..."

 arg_flavour.9.d:0 "In what seems to be an escalating conflict between the government and the Jewish community, a Jewish radio broadcaster named Samuel Glasserman has been imprisoned today by the Federal Police. The host of the 'La Matinee Radial Israelita', a bilingual radio program that transmitted in both Spanish and Yiddish, his radio had come under fire of the new Regime for transmitting in a foreign language, but it is only now that any charges have been raised against the broadcaster. Accused of cooperating with local socialists, his trial has been picked up particularly by the press as the evidence of the charges raised against him are considered largely circumstantial. However, given the harsher stance taken by the regime against jews, many speculate that the outcome of the trial has already been decided, and other Jewish radio hosts, like Tobias Berelejis from 'La Hora Israelita', have come out calling for Argentine Jews to move to neighbouring countries if possible."

The progressive politician, having largely taken a harsher stance towards conservatives after the assassination of Enzo Bordabehere, stepped down from public life after the Liga Patriótica's Coup in hopes of avoiding a political retaliation. However, it seems his own personal life was what got to him in the end, as a quick investigation has labelled his death as a suicide, with him even sending farewell letters to his close friends before shooting himself. Leaving behind a controversial legacy standing in the middle ground between revolutionaries and conservatives, the public still holds him in high esteem as many have attended his funeral, possibly thanks to his investigation of German intervention in the meat market in 1933."

 arg_flavour.11.d:0 "The movie 'La Vida de Carlos Gardel' ('The Life of Carlos Gardel') has premiered today in Argentine cinemas and has been greatly received by the public. Directed by Alberto de Zavalia and sporting famous Argentine Actors like Hugo del Carril and Delia Garces, the movie has drawn some controversy due to the way the plot diverges from Gardel's personal story. The plot revolves around Gardel, falling in love with a woman as he grows famous as an artist, only to sadly lose her love when he begins his international tour, ending with his ultimate demise in a plane crash; the woman is then only left with Gardel's records, but the story ends happily as they both reunite as ghosts. The issue raised by many of Gardel's most loyal fans is that the artist never had any public relationships with any woman and that the movie is taking a purposefully fictional take on the artist. The producers, however, have defended their work, claiming it was never meant to be a biography in return."

While an autopsy has yet to reveal the cause of death, it is widely believed he simply died of old age, as he was already sixty six years old, and having lived a fair share of complicated personal situations. As the leading member of the Pro-British wing of the Army, his death now marks a turning point towards the pro-German cliques, a favourable development for the GOU. However, Liborio has come out writing against the government and the military, blaming them for Justo's death.

While an autopsy has yet to reveal the cause of death, it is widely believed he simply died of old age, as he was already sixty six years old, and having lived a fair share of complicated personal situations. With the death of Liborio having turned him into a strong denouncer of the government, Justo had begun agitating in the UCRA to call for some level of opposition against our regime, who now have all but gone silent with his death. As the leading member of the Pro-British wing of the Army, his passing also marks a turning point towards the pro-German cliques, a favourable development for the GOU. While funeral arrangements are being done by his family, the government has largely remained quiet on the subject."

 arg_flavour.13.d:0 "Adolfo Bioy Casares has published today what can be considered the start of a new phase in his writing career, a short novel titled \"The Invention of Morel\", the first major work of science fiction in Hispanic literature. The book tells the story of a Venezuelan writer, by the name of \"El Fugitivo\", who, hiding from the law, casts away in a remote Pacific island where a strange disease seems to exist. Soon a group of people arrive, leading him to hide from them in fear of being turned in. However, he can’t help falling in love with one of them, a mysterious woman named Faustine who doesn’t seem to notice his presence. After a succession of anomalous events involving the strangers and the very nature of the island, El Fugitivo soon realises that the visitors are not what they appear.\n\nTouching themes such as madness, solitude and love, the book has accomplished both commercial and critical success, with fellow author Jorge Luis Borges writing that \"To classify it as perfect is neither an imprecision nor a hyperbole\". Bioy Casares, a friend of figures such as Borges and the Ocampo sisters, considers the book the true beginning of his writing career. Despite his status as a relatively obscure writer, it has become obvious that the novel will have a great influence on Argentine literature."

Standing at the intersection of the Corrientes and 9 de julio avenues, two of the Paris of South America’s most lively streets, the obelisk is 235 feet tall, a testament for the ages of our capital’s history.\n\nWith its construction delayed by the tumultuous political events of recent times, the monument was designed by rationalist architect Alberto Prebisch and built in a record time of 31 days by the German-Argentine Compañía General de Obras Públicas, who employed 157 workers in the construction. Over 200.000 pesos were invested, in what has become one of the most important and costly architectural endeavours in the city’s history.\n\nDespite the government’s intention of honouring Buenos Aires’ status as the nation’s capital, the effort has been received with some controversy by the city’s inhabitants, with many considering the building an \"ugly and unappealing pole of cement\". Regardless of the sneers and protests, we can only hope that eventually porteños will come to accept this new addition to the city’s patrimony."

 arg_flavour.15.d:0 "Today, after a gunfight with the police in the town of San Pedro de Atuel, the famous rural outlaw Juan Bautista Bairoletto has been declared dead. While the official version is that he was killed in the firefight, it has become a popular myth that he shot himself to avoid the dishonour of being captured. An almost legendary figure for the Argentine rural population, his death will undoubtedly be mourned by many.\n\nBorn in 1894, the son of Italian immigrants, Bairoletto was raised in a little town in the province of La Pampa. There, he occasionally broke the law through petty thefts and vagrancy, until a romantic dispute over a local prostitute ended in his assassination of the commissar of the town, causing him to become an outlaw. After this event, his criminal career quickly became well-known, with each assault and escape making him more admired by the people. Notably, Bairoletto stole from the rich and shared his profits with the poor, leading to him being known as the \"Argentine Robin Hood\" and earning him the praise of the Argentine left, especially the anarchists.\n\nWhile his death will without question be a propaganda victory for the regime of Buenos Aires, which drew a relation between the bandit and the rebels in Patagonia, it can’t be denied that for a significant part of the population, his demise is a sad reminder of the slow vanishing of the rural countryside traditions and the gaucho way of living."
