Her father, Armand Mureau, was a member of the French Paris Commune during the 1871 uprising and Her family was forced to move to Argentina in 1890. She met Hipólito Yrigoyen, who was professor of moral and civic instruction in her school, where they kept a friendly relation, with Yrigoyen beggining to inspire the young woman towards political activism. In 1906 she founded the Argentinean Feminist Movement, joining the Socialist Party and later entering the 'Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Buenos Aires' in 1907, where she graduated as a Physician a few years later.\n\nHowever, with the Great War raging on and the anarchist uprisings, her views began to conflict with the more radicalized Baldomeristas in the PS. As the Red Scare ran through the nation, she was forced to go underground until very recently.

He was one of the mediators between the workers at the 'Taller Vassena' and the national authorities, where he failed to successfully reach a compromise, which lead to a major crackdown in the events leading up to the dreaded 'Semana Tragica'. His party didn't fare much better, as the increasing authoritarianism of Yrigoyen began splitting the party into the old 'UCR' and the new 'Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista'.\n\nTamborini joined the latter while he was minister of the interior during Marcelo T. de Alvear's presidency. In 1935 he was chosen as national deputy, and his political experience has managed to allow him to get enough support to run for presidency. Now that he's head of state, it falls to him to bring about the reforms that Leandro N.

Robustiano took over his father's company, 'Patrón Hermanos' and then went on to become involved in Salta's Politics until he was elected governor of the same province between 1913 and 1916 with an independent party. His government in that province was characterized by great political stability and financial balance, and became one of the first provinces to fully embrace the Saenz Peña law.\n\nIn 1932, with the death of Uriburu and the upcoming elections, he formed among other independent leaders the 'Partido Democratico Nacional', where he was chosen as head of the party.

Justo, the 'Diario del Pueblo', one of the first socialist newspapers in Argentina. In 1900 he finally decided to affiliate to the 'Partido Socialista' which Justo had helped found, and then both founded the cooperative 'El Hogar Obrero' in 1905.\n\nAfter the death of Juan B. Justo, he became the obvious candidate of the now more moderate Partido Socialista, but didn't manage to win the 1932 national elections.

He kept climbing through the ranks of the party until becoming his uncle right-hand man and participating in the 'Revolución del Parque' as one of the main instigators. However, Alem's suicide became a hard hit for the UCR, and an even harder hit for Yrigoyen, who temporarily retired from politics until 1904, working as a teacher in the meantime.\n\nHe then reorganized the UCR in 1904 and managed to get one of his friends, Roque Sáenz Peña, elected as President in 1910, and even becoming President himself from 1916 to 1922. He pushed for progressive reforms and tried to normalize the Argentinean electoral system, even intervening in provinces that were under the control of wealthy elites. He even began granting workers better work laws and began negotiating with many strikers. However, British pressure forced him to begin the crackdowns that lead to the 'Semana Tragica', and the events that subsequently created the FOP.\n\nHis increasing authoritarianism lead to factionalism in the UCR and the subsequent split of the UCRA, and when he was re-elected in 1938, where his antagonizing position against the army and the local elites caused the Uriburu's 1930 coup, where he was banned from politics. Now that he's president again, he'll finish the reforms that he started in 1928 and will try to bring about his uncle's vision of a strong and democratic Argentina."

Unlike the leadership within the Socialist Party, he liked to keep direct contact with the workers, which gained him a lot of support among the trade unions. Despite having an illustrious performance within the 'CGT' ('Central General del Trabajo'), he never managed to climb up the ranks within the Socialist Party.\n\nAfter Uriburu's coup and the subsequent crackdowns on anarchist, syndicalists and socialists, he was arrested and taken to the Ushuaia penitentiary. Now that he's free and sits within the 'Casa Rosada', He'll use his connections within the Trade Unions to lead Argentina to a better tomorrow with the worker's consent."

However, Uriburu's coup forced him to change his point of view regarding democracy, where he even refused attending his own graduation ceremony which Uriburu would attend to give him an Honor Diploma in Law.\n\nHe was arrested in a democratic demonstration in 1931. This very detention has made Frondizi decide to leave his work as a law professor and begin a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested at another rally, and when he was released he joined the UCR.\n\nHe has since then joined a faction within the UCR that considers the approach of Marcelo T. de Alvear to be too conservative, and he has made promises to bring more progressive reforms to Argentina and return to the economic policies Yrigoyen enacted. Now that he sits in the 'Casa Rosada', it remains to be seen if he'll be true to his word."

When the UCR split, he joined the UCRA and became public works minister for Marcelo T. de Alvear.\n\nDespite his support for the democratic process, he supported Uriburu's coup, although he despised Uriburu's economic policies. After the Carlés coup, Ortiz has become convinced that the political corruption in Argentina has to end once and for all if democracy is ever to survive in Argentina, and will endeavour all of his efforts from the 'Casa Rosada' to strengthen the democratic process and end local corruption, with intervention if needed."
POLITICS_EDELMIRO_FARRELL_DESC:0 "Born to an Irish migrant family, Edelmiro Julian Farrel enrolled in a military school and graduated in 1907. While no one doubts of his military ability and personal charisma, he was never prepared to be a politician. Now that the role of presidency has been thrusted upon him after overthrowing Ramirez, he has become a mere puppet of the GOU's control over the country. He relies mostly on his vice-president, Juan Domingo Peron, to do most of the political work, where Farrel only ever appears in public ceremonies and signs public documents in the name of the GOU."

POLITICS_MIGUEL_DE_ANDREA_DESC:0 "Miguel de Andrea began his career after being ordained in 1899 by the Bishop of La Plata, Juan Terrero. He climbed steadily the ranks of the church until becoming the Head Priest of the San Miguel de Arcangel Church, and being named director of a Social-Christian Trade Union, the Circulos Obreros Catolicos, after the death of its founder, Federico Grote. However, unlike his founder, Miguel de Andrea took a hardline stance against the rising anarchist movements growing in the city of Buenos Aires, and as such quickly found himself alligning with the Liga Patriotica, taking part in their rallies and putting them into contact with the most reactionary sectors of the Argentinean branch of the Catholic Church.\n\nHowever, his views never alligned with the league, and he found himself coinciding more with the Portuguese Integralists who catered to his anti-liberal, ultra-catholic and Corporatist mindset. While originally skeptic of a Brazilian victory, he quickly abandoned the Liga Patriotica as the defeat seemed imminent, and began pushing his contacts in the Brazilian church in order to proclaim his loyalty to the Integralists. Without any solid military or civilian leaders willing to obey Brazilian commands, Miguel was chosen as the provisional President of Argentina until a more stable government can be settled in favour of the Integralist doctrine, which Miguel believes will finally bring faith in God, the Church and the government back to the workers."

POLITICS_ARTUR_NEIVA_BAH_DESC:0 "Artur Neiva is an extremely renowned and respected scientist, whose forays into politics are fairly recent, being appointed to administrative positions in the Bahian government of the early 1930s in the wake of the interstate war. While his experience in political matters is mostly practical in terms of bureaucracy, he is known worldwide for his studies and scientific expeditions in the US, Argentina and the hinterlands of Bahia and other brazilian states, which helps with the international standing of the newly founded republic, seeking to improve its situation through proven science rather than poorly planned idealism. He shares many political beliefs with Monteiro Lobato, and while some call out the eagerness of the pair to work with foreign powers, they believe they do what must be done for the advancement and development of their new nations."
POLITICS_A_BAH_DESC:0 "Luís Viana Filho hails from Salvador da Bahia, but was actually born in Paris. Having, like most politicians in his state, graduated in law school, he shifted his career towards journalism, working for multiple important newspapers in the area. Elected a representative in the 1930s, his career has steadily increased his clout, and he managed to place himself in a position to present himself as the leader of a stable, independent Bahia to the occupiers who then held Salvador. A man believing in aggressive and decisive action in politics, Luis plans to push an intense industrialization program in the newly independent republic."

POLITICS_VITAL_BAH_DESC:0 "Born before the time of the republic in 1874, Vital Soares is a well known liberal lawyer and politician hailing from the state of Bahia, just one of many prominent figures that followed the power vacuum that local oligarch JJ Seabra left in the state political landscape. While previously a staunch ally of Julio Prestes and one of the main figures of the Liberal Party, Vital joined the splinter Liberal Republican movement following frustration with the compromises made with the party's ideals, but his career certainly has taken an expected turn, as he is now at the helm of the first independent Bahian state in history. While his principles will certainly not waver easily, his position at the helm of what essentially is a puppet state is not an enviable one, especially since the new independence has not erased the old rivalries that have torn Bahia for decades."
POLITICS_BALEIA_BAH_DESC:0 "Aliomar de Andrade Baleeiro is a native of Salvador da Bahia, where he was born and raised, and graduated from university in 1921 with a degree in law, as is all too common in Bahian politics. Having worked on several different newspapers before starting his political career, he acted as both a state and federal representative in the old political order, never having reached the heights he seeked. Now, with the status quo completely destroyed by the conflict that ended Brazil, Aliomar has positioned himself not only to be the first president of an independent and free Bahia, but also to curtail the clout of many of his long standing political opponents while increasing his own. Many believe that this is but the first step towards the beginning of a brand new political dynasty in Bahia."
POLITICS_JURACY_BAH_DESC:0 "A respected military man, Juracy gained notoriety by his fast rise in state politics in Bahia. However, the rise of such a notable outsider can usually be explained by loss of popularity and legitimacy by political leadership, and in the case of Bahia, it was the fall from grace of the oligarch JJ Seabra. Now at the helm of Bahia yet again, a fact no doubt consequential of his immense political clout on the region, but now as a sovereign state, he looks to both improve the economical situation and improve diplomatic ties with non hostile regimes to ensure better trading partners in these chaotic times."
POLITICS_GRABOIS_BAH_DESC:0 "Maurício Grabois, born in Salvador da Bahia in 1912, is descended from bessarabian jews that fled the ever growing chaos of the Russian Empire during the Russo-Japanese war to find a new life in Brazil, after a long journey . While studying at a military school, he started to lean towards radical leftism, while also becoming a staunch opposition of the ever growing integralist ideology that seemed to spread into barracks across the country then. While just 24 years old, he already was leading syndical and socialist activities, and his early rise only went further within the labour cause. After so much and war and destruction, it'd be easy to lose hope, but Mauricio sees the newfound independence of Bahia as an unparalleled opportunity for the country to truly leave its past of poverty and oligarchy behind in the dust of history. However, such things are far easier planned than done, as even with military support of the occupiers, dislodging the extremely powerful coroneis from their positions of power held for centuries may be a violent and costly endeavour for all parties involved."
POLITICS_MARIGHELLA_BAH_DESC:0 "Carlos Marighella is from Salvador, hailing from a poor family of italian father and hausa mother. Born in 1911, he was a talented student, notorious in his school for his skills with verse and prose alike, but he soon turned into politics, becoming involved in the constant confrontations that occured between syndicalists and integralists in downtown Salvador. While he was arrested a few times, he did manage to be elected a representative in 1936, albeit that was a relatively short lived state of affairs, as he grew frustrated with his inability to actually make a difference in the station. This certainly is not the case as head of state in Bahia, where he has received support from many of his former Brazilian comrades to step up and lead the newly established commune to prosperity and socialism. However, his already old enemies in the oligarchic families of the state must be dealt with before any of these dreams can be realized."
POLITICS_JORGE_AMADO_BAH_DESC:0 "Jorge Leal Amado de Faria was born in Itabuna in 1912, and began his career as an author as early as age fourteen. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro to conclude his studies of law, and there was influenced by the many left wing intellectuals and the ideas of the revolutions in Europe, whose success seemed to inspire the left wing elites of the country. He later became a journalist, and only truly joined the political arena in the years after the tumultuous 1936 elections. While he officially defines himself as irreligious, he is in practice a practitioner of Candomblé, an african traditional faith that has many practitioners in the state of Bahia, and is well acquainted with most religious leaders in his home region. Now thrusted into the position of head of state, many question his relative lack of experience in the political arena when compared to other candidates for the task, a concern clearly not shared by the majority of representatives, evidently. While his enthusiastic approach to his new job is certainly for many welcome, he may well not be prepared for the great task of ensuring the cooperation of the disparate unions and factions in the nation."
POLITICS_MAMEDE_BAH_DESC:0 "Jurandir de Bizarria Mamede was born in Salvador in the year 1906, and from an early age prepared for a military career, gaining minor positions in the local infantry regiment by 1927; and such, he is a veteran officer of the interstate war. He then was transferred to several garrison and military police commands, always serving with distinction and climbing the ranks of the military by his own merits. While many defeated officers have chosen to shy away from public duty after the devastating that so recently ended, Jurandi has chosen to embark into the political arena, as he sees himself in the best position to re-establish the rule of law and order to the newly established Republic of Bahia. He takes a particular dislike of syndicalists, and this distance is by no means secret and quite a few of these politicians have pre-emptively left Bahia before he can decisively move against these traitors."

With the collapse of the British Raj, Nehru, while a staunch advocate for immediate independence from the weakened Empire, worked tireless to mediate all manner of disputes among Indian leaders across the political spectrum. While his detractors would slander Nehru as indecisive and cowardly, Nehru's subtle political manoeuvring was essential for his ascension to the highest levels of the Indian National Congress, and now the Bharatiya Commune itself. Under Nehru's leadership, perhaps the factionalism which has plagued the Congress for decades may finally be assuaged."

Negotiating Bhutan’s place in the world following instability in both neighboring Tibet and India, Jigme has managed to retain the status quo in his mountain kingdom, though many would attribute these successes to his Gongzim and ally Sonam Topgye Dorji.  With dark clouds brewing on the horizon, there is some question as to whether Jigme can maintain his grip on the young kingdom."

He is a man of contradictions, quick to laugh but quicker to anger, the host of numerous concubines but no wives.

POLITICS_JIGME_DORJI_DESC:0 "The late King Jigme’s eldest son, young Jigme Dorji holds little power aside from his family name.  However, his education has taken him outside of the mountain kingdom and began to give him knowledge of the outside world and a desire for reform in his own realm.  While the kingdom is currently ruled by his regent Sonam Topgye Dorji, there is little doubt that King Jigme Dorji has great plans for the nation following his ascension."

Returning to India at the height of the Weltkrieg, he soon became a leading advocate for caste egalitarianism.  When revolution came to India, he was quick to travel to Calcutta to join the young revolutionary government.  Disappointment soon set in as the initial zeal of revolution gave way to pragmatism, and Ambedkar soon found himself politically isolated.  Once a strong supporter of the Agrarian faction of the Congress, their renewed commitment to the traditional caste system under the guidance of Mohandas Gandhi dashed his dreams of an agrarian and egalitarian state.  He drifted towards the Maximist faction, mostly due to their strong condemnation of caste politics, but was never comfortable with the rest of their political aims.  With his presence in Calcutta becoming tiresome for both Gandhi and Bose and his interest in Buddhism well known, Ambedkar was the perfect man to lead the Bharatiya mission into Bhutan.  Whether the mountainous nation is a political purgatory to imprison the rabble-rouser or the perfect canvas to display his policies is yet to be seen."

POLITICS_OTAVIO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "Otavio made his politcal debut in 1908 at the contentious politics of the state of Bahia, and his rapid rise in notoriety gave him fame, and some exiles from the state as well. Said notoriety was enough for him to later become a State Representative in 1912. His staunch positions in favour of the late Washington Luis and João Pessoa during the times of civil helped to raise his profile to greater heights, and he was elected president of the State of Bahia in the elections organized there in 1928. Later, as consensus bid for the Brazilian Republican Party, his name was put forward for the position of President of the Republic, and was endorsed by then President João Pessoa. His presidency was very much a return to normalcy at first, but the rise of radical movements especially in the cities, and public order in general, is a rising concern. However, the good pace of economic and political recovery has ensured his popularity remains high, and it is possible that some of this popularity is why João Mangabeira, his brother, became a household name more left wing circles."

He came to Brazil looking for his father, who had emigrated years earlier than him, in 1903, and reunited with him shortly thereafter. However, soon their political differences put a wedge on their relationships, and later on Abilio converted to Spiritism and joined union circles. Inspired by the revolutions in Europe, he joined the anarchist International Workers Union, but their militant atheism caused him and some other men to split off and form the Maximalist Union, a party that opposed their ideas in more matters than just religion. The Maximalist movement grew and garned much strength in Porto Alegre, but still he faced opposition from anarchist unions, who were still the majority in the city, but his influence grew with time. In recent years, he was influenced by other centralist socialists abroad, and his Maximalist Union was one of the many leftist movements to support the so called Democratic Left. He is well respected by most Syndicalists in Brazil, even if his scathing and combative personality got him kicked out of more than one meeting. To him, Brazil's many issues after a decade of chaos can only be solved by a firm hand and unity among the people, a view shared by many army and navy officers.

In the next decade, his staunch defence of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key turning point in the electoral race, and he became nationally known after the endorsement, Thrusted into his new position by the first congress of trade unions, Mangabeira is the first black president and the first syndicalist to occupy the highest office in the country, and the nation holds its breath to see what will come to pass during the Oliveira government."

While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot on the grave'' is dangerous for Brazilian democracy, the three time state president of Minas Gerais' politcal power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. His long support of Vargas in the Republican Party can be seen as ideological similarities, as both see a united and proactive federal government as vital for a better Brazil, but their alliance is often seen as one of convenience between the most powerful politicians of two powerful states of the Union. While his platform during elections was mostly a repeat of Vargas's 10 years ago, the ''old man president'' doesnt really considers the southerner his sucessor, as he envisions Gustavo Capanema as the one to inherit his political legacy in Brazil as a whole."
POLITICS_BORGES_DE_MEDEIROS_BRA_DESC:0 "Few men alive had as much of an impact in Brazilian politics, and especially in the Rio Grande do Sul state, as Antônio Augusto Borges de Medeiros, known politically by his last two names. Starting his political career in the 1890s, he swiftly rose through the ranks and assumed the position of state president from 1898 to 1908 and from 1913 to 1926, and was at the centre of the innumerable political crises, revolts and intrigues in Rio Grande do Sul during the timeframe, while also steadily rising to national prominence. Considered by many a man of unparalleled charisma and integrity, Borges refused a judicial position early in his life, in 1892, to focus entirely on politics, and has always tried to strike a balance between his ideas for a progressive Brazil and the whirlwind of political forces in his country and state. Having positioned himself very publically in favour of São Paulo in 1927, his views on the integrity of the state's soverignty remain unchanged, as does his disdain for any centralizing overtures by the government in Rio de Janeiro. Now elected president at nearly his eighties, his positivist beliefs are staunchier than ever, after the national-level schsim of the liberal party and a contested electoral race. While establishing a parliamentary majority and governing the large democracy is a challenge, Borges' gravitas and personal charm will no doubt play an important role in keeping the republic on the way to progress"

His beliefs clashed with other, older politicians and less liberally inclined members of the party, but his urban remodelling and subsequent tenure as Mayor of São Paulo made him well known nation wide, and thus he was picked to lead the splinter liberal ticket. His lack of political experience, especially at the national arena, may make his government quite the eventful affair, as his plans to remodel the country's fiscal and infrastructure systems may very well find stiff resistance in parliament, even with his own party's views.

He rose quickly, becoming state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the party his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While the victory at the elections may be seen as a surprise, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire nation of Brazil, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, already as a young man opposing the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of 1936 has been long left behind. His stances on economical and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the ever eventful politics of Brazil may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."
POLITICS_ASSIS_BRA_DESC:0 "A true old timer of Rio Grande do Sul politics, Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brasil is a well respected politician, backed by his years of experience dealing with both local and national party members. His career started in 1884, still in the waning years of the Empire, and he became an important figure during the Old Republic era, even if at a national level he was often overshadowed by other natives of his state, he performed very important roles, including vital diplomatic missions to Argentina, Mexico, the USA and more. A true gaucho, Joaquim adores the free country life of the plains, even if he is not advised to ride horses anymore due to his advanced age. Still, he always associated the freedom of the gaucho rider with that of the republican freedoms, and even if not a separatist, places a deep value to the traditions of a state. He is also a prolific historical and political writer, even if some of the concepts proposed in his books, like that of an ''voting machine'' to prevent fraud, do seem truly outlandish. While his victory has led to rabid optimism by most party members, he knows that keeping control of the lower house may well be a far more difficult affair than they predict, as the Liberal majority is tenuous at best, and the party remains relatively fractured even after the split."
POLITICS_AFONSO_FEATHER_JUNIOR_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Santa Barbara in Minas Gerais, Afonso Augusto Moreira Pena Júnior started his career like many other local politicians, studying law and becoming a state representative. Even though he is a very successful liberal and a respected literary intellectual, he always had to deal with the looming shadow that his father, former President Afonso Pena, whose achievements and legacy always seemed impossible to match. But now, he too has become president of Brazil, but unlike his father, who was frustrated at every turn by powerful landlords and political opponents, Junior is determined to advance and modernize the Brazilian nation to the standard enjoyed by other nations, especially in its farthest reaches, both in terms of education and infrastructure development. However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, for even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Brazil, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_JOAO_GOULART_BRA_DESC:0 "João Belchior Marques Goulart, known by the common people by the nickname Jango, hails from a family of powerful landowners in Rio Grande do Sul. While he is a relatively young man, his career in politics saw a rapid rise since it's start in the 1940s, but before that he studied law and notably was a youth player for Internacional in Porto Alegre before entering the political arena, under the auspices of his father, the rather powerful Vicente Goulart. He has always been a bit more left leaning than his father however, and his election may well be the shake-up the left in Brazil needed in this decade, as many of the old slogans and talking points have been rendered moot by changes in legislation. Frequently accused of being a syndicalist or a populist, Jango is steadfast in his moderate stance, defending that all voices are heard, but also vehemently denying claims of syndicalism. This so called ‘softness’ towards what many in Brazil consider dangerous radicals may well cause instability during his rule, as Republican political forces already prepared to thwart his every move in congress. It seems that winning the elections is just the first of many battles head of Jango's presidency."
POLITICS_OSVALDO_ARANHA_BRA_DESC:0 "Osvaldo Euclides de Sousa Aranha hails from the town of Alegrete, in Rio Grande do Sul. Ever since the earliest points of his career, he has been seen as both a reliable mediator and a skilled administrator, skills sorely necessary in a state where political violence was at a breaking point until the state presidency of Getúlio Vargas, a man who is one of his closest allies and friends, and it's a common occurence to see both side by side. Having spent most of his career as a diplomat after the Civil War, he returned to Brazil and politics at the request of his longtime friend, as a consensus candidate was sorely needed in the ranks of the ever fractured Republican party, even if the party itself is not nearly as divided and decentralized as it was during the early 1930s. His remarkable experience as a mediator is surely to be invaluable as the head of state, and it's widely predicted that his demeanour and relatively moderate stances will ensure one of the most stable and hopefully prosperous presidencies in Brazil's republican history, as his party gives him an extremely comfortable political position at the Catete. His years as a diplomat will also hopefully help with diplomacy abroad, as Brazil looks more than ever outwards in these new times."
POLITICS_JK_BRA_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the son of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the Germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War. Afterwards, he began his by now very long political career. While he is a well known figure in Belo Horizonte, where he even ran for the office of mayor in the past, and has been a representative in Rio multiple times, his clout outside of his home state has always been somewhat limited, even after the victory in the election, as the Liberal party has to juggle with opposition at every corner of congress. However, even with these issues, JK, as he is more commonly known to the public, has big plans. Not just urban renewal, infrastructure investments or political reforms, he is a very vocal proponent of the proposal of moving the capital of the nation further inland to push development in the great hinterlands of the Cerrado plains, which would be an outrageously expensive endeavour. Regretfully for him, and thankfully for the state budget some say, such a proposal is already dead on arrival, with massive opposition from several groups in parliament and prominent newspapers."
POLITICS_LANDRY_SALES_DESC:0 "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While he did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances while keeping his militarist political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. His nomination by the party was somewhat contested, but the true challenge will be to retain control of congress with a significant house minority, especially since there is little chance of the Liberal factions cooperating even this long after their political split, albeit there is nothing a few ministerial positions can’t solve, some say. Regardless, his presidency is probably going to be one of the most difficult affairs in recent memory, but the man is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."

Having been a political activist from a very young age, Elisa was one of the few openly socialist politicians to run for office under the ED umbrella and succeed in the contentious 1936 elections, being always a voice for the worker's movement in parliament. Her general political experience put her ahead of the pack in the selection process for chairman, but even still gathering the necessary support was by no means an easy feat, as Brazil's unions are even more decentralized in terms of ideology and state lines than the previous parties once were. Now in power and leading Brazil's nascent socialist government, Elisa has to deal with a tumultuous foreign and internal political landscape, and ensure that the planned industrialization and development programs go on as planned.

Despite the fallout of their coalition's perceived failures, and the many political issues since arisen, she has not faltered in her desire to establish a broad left front to improve the situation in Brazil, even if it means great compromises with the Social Democrats and other traditional political forces in the country. Now known nationwide as the 'Red Senator' after a long tenure maintaining worker's rights at the forefront, she has to assuage military personnel's rampant fear of a syndicalist coup, as her proposals, while seen as overly moderate by her fellow syndicalists, are extremely radical for a nation like Brazil. However, the longstanding dissatisfaction of the common people with the seemingly endless inability of the federal government to end poverty, unemployment and other far more pressing concerns than ideological disagreements have ensured she managed to win a democratic election and become the first female to do so. Now she has to deal not only with the traditionally conservative elites, but with a constantly divided and bickering powerbase in an even less stable legislature; and yet she wholly believed she can turn Brazil's fortunes around for good."

From 1893 in the Federalist Revolt in his home state to now the Chilean Crisis, his steady hand and respect by the people and officers granted him enough political capital to proclaim himself provisional president. Despite persistent requests by other officers, especially from those further to the right who see his moderate voice as needed, Isidoro has stated in no uncertain terms that his government is temporary, and he will step down as soon as the Union representatives and delegates meet to select a ruler. Time will tell if this decision is the right one for the future of the country."

POLITICS_EVERARDO_DIAS_DESC:0 "Everardo Dias was actually born in the town of Pontevedra in Spain, and came to Brazil while very young in 1887, as his father fled his home country. He started working at age 13 on a major Paulista newspaper, but his studies later turned towards law, as is all to common for Brazilian politicians. A long time anti-clerical and anti-censorship advocate, Everardo was writing about his political thoughts as early as 1902, and has partook in most great strikes and political actions by socialist and anarchist elements in São Paulo in this century, being one of the most recognizable figures of the movement. His long and storied history with the labour movement was doubtlessly a chief factor to see his name put forward by the congress of trade unions as the head of their council, but he also is a conciliatory and non radical figure, always defending differing viewpoints and the right of non socialist opposition do demonstrate and even put forward candidates for certain offices. While some claim this comes from a misguided sense of camaraderie with his fellow freemasons and former political associates in the republican era, the truth is simply his ever staunch defence of free speech, as a system that cannot withstand criticism is not strong enough to do real change in a country as vast and unequal as Brazil."
POLITICS_CANDIDO_PORTINARI_DESC:0 "The son of Italian immigrants, Candido Portinari was born in the small town of Brodowski, in the state of São Paulo. Always having been a prolific artist, he started his career as a helper in the restoration of churches in his hometown, and at just age 16 he moved to Rio to enrol in the national school of arts, where his talent was immediately recognized. Since then, his position as one of the foremost artists of the nation has solidified, but his political career is far more recent, having only in recent times become truly active as an elected union representative. While his political experience is somewhat limited, his talent and intellect made him well known, and as with many other elections, this fame placed him an advantageous position when compared to his fellow candidates. While it's certainly an advantage for a head of state to be such a respected artist, especially on the international level, many raise concerns about having such an inexperienced man as head of state."
POLITICS_DJALMA_MARANHAO_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the revolution, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Brazil's socialist government, and seeks to turn development efforts to northeast, as he feels previous governments have put the needs of urban, industrial workers ahead of the great many Brazilians who still work on the fields and on small towns across the nation. Such a paradigm shift is popular in non central regions, but naturally less so in Rio, São Paulo and other major urban centers. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."
POLITICS_OTTO_ACLIDES_OHLWEILER_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Porto Alegre, Rio do Grande do Sul, Otto Alcides Ohlweiler is perhaps a teacher first, and a politician second, having dedicated most of his life to his career as a chemistry laureate and teacher at the local federal university. Author of multiple books, most of his political life has been dedicated towards left wing causes, which he formally joined in the early 1930s. While he did run for office under the ED umbrella in the 1936 elections, he was ultimately frustrated by the political games of parliament, and was one of the advocates of changing the legislative to its current form in the congress of trade unions. Having always leaned towards a more european ideal of syndicalism, Otto's views fit well with the Internationale's official stances, but much less so with the majority of anarchists and socialists in the congress of trade unions."
POLITICS_JOAO_MANGABEIRA_DESC:0 "João Mangabeira started out as a noteworthy defence attorney in Ilhéus, before turning to politics like his brother, former president Otávio. Early on in his career he was a close and passionate follower of Rui Barbosa, but after his mentor's passing, he carved a career of its own as a federal representative of the state of Bahia. A man with deeply rooted anti-authoritarian principles, he was a vocal supporter of Bahia's role in the civil conflict, and gained notoriety as a result. As his career went by, the continuous and yet seemingly fruitless struggle of Brazil's poor brought him closer to the left, and while he certainly has some socialist views and allies in union and intellectual circles, he certainly is no Syndicalist. His plan for Brazil was to build a broad leftist front to oppose the current status quo, and his success was unexpected, but probably not unpredictable considering the social upheaval following Black Monday and the scandalous repression of labour movements nationwide. Now, he has to juggle the several disparate factions in his left front while keeping the ravenous opposition at bay, and it seems his presidency is certainly going to be as eventful as his brother's."
POLITICS_APOLONIO_DE_CARVALHO_DESC:0 "Apolônio de Carvalho is one of the most notable military servicemen to have joined political life in the left wing, having had a long and distinguished career in the Brazilian military after he left his home in Corumbá to serve. He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. One of the most enthusiastic supporters of the counter-coup that brought about the revolution in Brazil, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country are being too slow and gradual, and doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the revolution. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army. As a military man, he also believes in a proactive foreign policy to safeguard the interests of the revolution."
POLITICS_JORGE_AMADO_DESC:0 "Jorge Leal Amado de Faria was born in Itabuna, Bahia, in 1912, and began his career as an author as early as age fourteen. He moved on to Rio de Janeiro to conclude his studies of law, and there was influenced by the many left wing intellectuals and the ideas of the revolutions in Europe, whose success seemed to inspire the left wing elites of the country. He later became a journalist, and only truly joined the political arena in the years after the tumultuous 1936 elections. While he officially defines himself as irreligious, he is in practice a practitioner of Candomblé, an african traditional faith that has many practitioners in the state of Bahia, and is well acquainted with most religious leaders in his home region. Now thrust into the position of head of state, many question his relative lack of experience in the political arena when compared to other candidates for the task. While his enthusiastic approach to his new job is certainly for many welcome at a time where revolutionary fervour is cooling down, he may well not be prepared for the great task of ensuring the cooperation of the disparate unions and factions in the nation."

POLITICS_OSWALD_DE_ANDRADE_DESC:0 "A paulista born in the capital of that state in 1890, José Oswald de Sousa de Andrade has always been an intellectual first and a politician second, but his influence on leftist circles across Brazil cannot be understated. His role in the modernist is quite extensive, with some coming as far as calling him it's founder and main proponent. While he used to be married to Patricia Rehder Galvão, who is more known by her nickname Pagu, the marriage broke down in less than half a decade, as did his previous marriage to another renowned artist, Tarsila do Amaral. While he is known for generally humoured and spirited demeanour, he also is described as combative and often aggressive in arguments, which may explain his relationship's short duration. Still, his charisma carried him with relative ease to a victory in swaying the congress of trade unions to choose him as the leader of the revolution, a task he plans to take on very seriously. While his literary and artistic identity is well defined, few can guess what kind of leader he will be on the international arena, and the nation now pays close attention whether he will make friends or enemies when meeting with foreign diplomats."
POLITICS_PEDRO_VENTURA_POMAR_DESC:0 "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar lived certainly an unorthodox childhood, having moved to New York from his home state of Pará while aged 5, living there for two years before returning to his small birth town of Obidos, and then moving to the state capital of Belem. He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publicly, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age. Having taken the lead of the entirety of Brazil is one thing, but properly leading the extremely disparate and decentralized factions is another matter entirely. While he calmly believes matters will be sorted shortly and that the revolutionary process will continue smoothly, many wonder if his relative lack of contacts in upper syndicalist circles in major centres of the south may leave him isolated in his own cabinet."
POLITICS_LILLIA_RIPOLL_DESC:0 "Born in a small town in Rio Grande do Sul in 1905, Lila Ripoll began her public life as studying and performing music in Porto Alegre, but she also was a poet before she entered politics, a sudden change she and few around her could have predicted. Such a sudden change came when her cousin Waldemar Ripoll was assassinated in 1936, allegedly on the orders of one of the major local strongmen, Flores da Cunha. This strengthened her resolve, and compelled her to join the unions in their strikes. Her determination to make a positive impact, constant and active political presence, and rising renown among the Unions of Brazil, who see her and her story as a symbol of worker's struggle, and of merit and competency, made her a natural choice to run for the post of chairwoman by the unions of Rio Grande do Sul, and their pitch has been welcomed by the Congress, who named Lila their leader. Now, she hopes to make a positive impact in the country, but her idealism may clash with the tough choices ahead, and the world in conflict around her."
POLITICS_OTTO_ALCIDES_OHLWEILER_SYN_DESC:0 "Born and raised in Porto Alegre, Rio do Grande do Sul, Otto Alcides Ohlweiler is perhaps a teacher first, and a politician second, having dedicated most of his life to his career as a chemistry laureate and teacher at the local federal university. Author of multiple books, most of his political life has been dedicated towards left wing causes, which he formally joined in the early 1930s. While he did run for office under the ED umbrella in the 1936 elections, he was ultimately frustrated by the political games of parliament, and was one of the advocates of changing the legislative to its current form in the congress of trade unions. Having always leaned towards a more european ideal of syndicalism, Otto's views fit well with the Internationale at large and the majority of orthodox syndicalists in the congress."
POLITICS_EUGENIA_ALVARO_MOREYRA_DESC:0 "Eugênia Álvaro Moreyra was born in Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais, in 1898. After the early death of her father, she and her mother moved to Rio de Janeiro, where she was self taught in proper Portuguese and French. Shortly after her first job at age 15, she joined the A Rua newspaper as a reporter, a fact so unprecedented a brand new work was coined for a female reporter, reportisa. She was one of the key figures in the suffragette movement, and she also became the first major female political figure in leftist and modernist circles, and in these same circles she met her future husband, the poet Álvaro Moreyra, whom she married in 1914. Having been among the earliest members of the PSB and the ED alongside her closest associates like Oswald de Andrade and Carlos Lacerda, she has a longstanding influence on the going's on of the left wing in capital of Rio, and therefore the entire nation, for decades, and this influence has made her one of the key figures of the new Union of Brazil. Her aggressive activism towards gender equality has some less enthusiastic revolutionaries worried about the pace of the changes imposed on the generally conservatvie Brazilian public, she nevertheless remains undeterred and in her dedication to the cause that has taken most of her life by now."
POLITICS_RACHEL_DE_QUEIROZ_DESC:0 "Perhaps better known for her activities as an author, journalist, teacher and translator, Rachel de Queiroz mostly represents the interests of her unions than that of any established political movement in the modern post revolutionary landscape, as she never had a very deep connection with leftist cliques. Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the congress, with the backing of several northeastern delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialization programs, or building huge railways across the nation."
POLITICS_ARMANDA_ALVARO_ALBERTO_DESC:0 "Few women have worked for the feminist and educational causes as long, and as strongly, as Armanda Álvaro Alberto. A founding member of the Brazilian Femine Union, she also was a pioneer in establishing the Proletarian School model, where poor children were granted both food and education from the school, but also she had great influence from foreign innovations in education, especially from Montessori's New School method. She has always defended a position where women of all categories must join to fight for their rights, but also against divisive rhetoric that paints men as an enemy of women, which she saw as shallow and petty. Her position at the forefront of socialist movements has landed her more than one tenure in jail, but also great fame and acclaim in political circles. Her main goals are to combat hunger and the shoddy state of education in the entirety of Brazil, spreading a standardized method of teaching to schools all across the nation."
POLITICS_MAURICO_GRABOIS_DESC:0 "Maurício Grabois, born in Salvador da Bahia in 1912, is descended from bessarabian Jews that fled the ever growing chaos of the Russian Empire during the Russo-Japenese war to find a new life in Brazil, after a long journey. While studying at military school, he started to lean towards radical leftism, while also becoming a staunch opposition of the ever growing integralist ideology that seemed to spread into barracks across the country then. While just 24 years old, he already was leading syndical and socialist activities, and his early rise only went further within the labour cause."
POLITICS_PEDRO_IV_BRA_DESC:0 "Born in exile in 1909, His Imperial Highness Pedro de Alcântara Henrique Astolfo Filipe Maria Gastão Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga de Orléans e Bragança e Bourbon is the grandson of Princess Isabel, heir of Pedro II, the greatest and last emperor of Brazil. Having spent his childhood at Castle D'eu with the Imperial family in exile, he wasnt able to set foot in Brazil until the Decree of Banishment by the republic was revoked in the 1920s, even though he was deferred from serving in the armed forces in 1925. Having come to live permanently in Brazil after the civil war, which convinced him personally more than ever that a monarchy was needed by the people, he immediately started to articulate politically towards his restoration, and his scheme has finally come to fruition as he has been crowned Pedro III of Brazil. He has been prepared all his life, from childhood tutors to lessons as an adult, for this station he considers his birthright, but few things could prepare a man for the tumultuous times since Black Monday shattered the economic order of the world. While he certainly is thankful for the assistance of the Integralist movement in restoring him, his views towards the more radical wings of the party are not as positive as one could think, as their extreme views often clash with his milder ones."
POLITICS_GUSTAVO_CAPANEMA_DESC:0 "Born in the small town of Pitangui, Minas Gerais, Gustavo Capanema Filho is great-grandson of Guilherme Schüch, the Baron of Capanema. Like most men in influential families, Gustavo studied law in university, becoming a city councillor in Pitangui shortly after his graduation. He has climbed the ranks in the PR very quickly, and while he is a capable man, this is in no small part due to the immense influence wielded by his close friend and associate Getúlio Vargas, as he is one of the few that has the gaucho's trust. His nomination and election campaign had Vargas's widespread support, as cartoonists often drew Capanema as little more than his sockpuppet. But despite these attacks, he remains a staunch ally to Vargas, who now leads his political articulation in congress to ready for a smooth republican government. While many rejoice the stability of the orderly elections, some worry that the oligarchs of the plantations of the old republic have been replaced with a new type of politician, far more cunning and malleable. Capanema, of course, knows these to be only the rumblings of a defeated and scattered opposition, as the many newspapers under republican control will surely begin sharing in the coming months. His politics of self strengthening and industrialization have much in common with Vargas's, as well."

POLITICS_GEORGE_DESC:0 "'국왕 겸 황제'는 그 호칭대로 26년간 대영제국을 다스렸습니다. 그는 '해가 지지 않는 제국'의 영광이 절정에 달하던 1910년 왕위에 올랐지만, 재위 내내 대영제국의 쇠퇴를 지켜보아야만 했습니다. 사촌에게 패배한 세계대전, 막내아들 존의 죽음, 결정적으로 영국 본토의 상실이 조지 5세의 정신을 무너뜨렸습니다. 조지가 '냉동 감옥'이라 부르는 캐나다로 망명한 이후로는 건강마저 나날이 악화되었습니다. 그는 그의 아들 에드워드 왕자에게 의례적인 업무 대부분을 위임하고 국내 정치에 관심을 끊었습니다. 그는 이제 영국으로 귀향하는 날만을 기다리며 버티고 있지만, 전망은 날이 갈수록 어두워지기만 합니다."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "에드워드 윈저는 그의 아버지, 조지 5세의 죽음과 함께 오타와에서 왕위를 계승했습니다. 엄숙히 즉위한 이 젊은 왕은 흔적만 남은 제국의 옛 영광과 생디칼리스트 혁명가들에게 점거당한 왕국을 물려받았습니다. 의심할 여지 없이 에드워드 왕은, 무엇보다도 유니온 잭이 다시 브리튼 제도 위를 당당하게 날아 오르기를 희망하고 있습니다."

POLITICS_JAMES_CANNON_DESC:0 "Personally mentored by Big Bill Haywood and well versed in the struggles of the American left, James Cannon became an unshakable presence within the socialist party of America. Although initially a fanatic adherent to Bolshevism, the failure of the Russian revolution contrasted with the triumph of the French syndicalists made Cannon adopt a more libertarian view on socialism. As a formal representative of the SPA, he spent much time abroad in France and Britain, before returning to America after the outbreak of the civil war. Helping to organize foreign volunteers and the Internationale's advisers, he cemented his reliability as a brilliant administrator. With the war won, Cannon would immediately start to build the momentum needed to run for president, and has now finally fulfilled his ambition!"
POLITICS_CARLO_TRESCA_DESC:0 "Born to an impoverished family in Italy, Tresca's emigration to America became the first major step in a tumultuous life which saw him soon emerge as Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America. Having built up a famed reputation as an anarchist, a strike organizer and a community leader among Italian immigrants, Tresca became an integral figure within the IWW. His oratory and legal skills were put to use defending men such as Sacco and Vanzetti, as well as stopping the infiltration and manipulation of trade unions by the Italian Mafia. He spent much time vocally supporting the revolution in his homeland Italy, defending the merits, accomplishments and potentials of the Italian Socialist Republic to his fellow Italian-Americans. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, Carlo Tresca played a key role in the takeover and new administration of New York City, he survived multiple assassination attempts and scores of protests against his campaign for being an Italian immigrant. His prior accomplishments within the Italian Socialist Federation and the IWW has now allowed Carlo Tresca to launch a successful campaign to become President."
POLITICS_ARTURO_GIOVANNITTI_DESC:0 "Born in Abruzzi Italy, Arturo was one of the hundreds of thousands who came to the United states seeking opportunity. Arturo instead found a ripe political climate for expanding workers’ rights. Arturo was there during the 1912 Textile Strike of Lawrence, Massachusetts, where his illegal arrest and subsequent trial in a metal cage became a rallying point for the New England IWW. Arturo was acquitted of all charges, and became a socialist activist, first opposing the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, then the US's entry into the war. During the revolution, Arturo led an Italian American brigade out of New England and into the CSA territory under hostile fire. A talent for speaking and poetry elevated his campaign. Ultimately he was elected President as a true citizen."
POLITICS_MEYER_LONDON_DESC:0 "Born in Tsarist Lithuania under the grip of Russian influence. Meyer's first ambition was to become a Talmudic scholar like his father. The adverse conditions of Russia forced Meyer's family to relocate to New York City, where Meyer became a printer. Printing for Yiddish publications, Meyer had fallen into one such group of radical intellectuals that encouraged him to become a lawyer. Starting in the 1890s, Mayer joined Eugene V. Deb's Social Democratic Party, and was a leading organizer of the 1910 New York Clockmakers Strike. A coalition ticket with Progressives allowed Meyer to become the first of many socialists in Congress. Meyer opposed the U.S's entry into the Weltkrieg, and yet aided the McAdoo administration in promoting militancy. Meyer even angered Jewish labor by promoting partisan Jewish organizations above Zionist labor groups. Meyer went undercover during the Crisis of 36, and re-emerged following the war championing many of the issues he was against. Meyer the pro-Zionist war hawk was much more popular, even against protesters claiming he couldn't run for President as an immigrant."
POLITICS_UPTON_SINCLAIR_DESC:0 "Born in 1878, in Baltimore, Upton was an aspiring author from an early age. In his teens he wrote pulp magazines and poetry to make a living, eventually moving into investigative journalism. His moment in the spotlight came after he spent seven weeks disguised as a worker in Chicago's meatpacking plants, drafting a political expose on the poor labor conditions of the plants. Although Sinclair had hoped to rally the country behind the worker's cause, he instead merely exposed the lack of hygiene in the meatpacking industry, of which he declared "I aimed for the country's heart, but hit them in the stomach". With the profits from his literary career, Sinclair pursued politics in California, launching the "End Poverty In California" campaign. E.P.I.C as it came to be known was not the roaring triumph he had expected, but gave Sinclair enough fame and recognition that he could later pursue a second political career in the new America. Now championing a E.P.I.C movement applied nationwide, Upton Sinclair has won the recent presidential election with a startling margin."
POLITICS_FRANK_LITTLE_DESC:0 "Born to a family of Oklahoma homesteaders, Frank Little moved to California in order to escape the miserable droughts that had ruined his family's land. Him and his brother both became ministers, but in 1905 Frank became a full-time organizer for the IWW. A proud wobbly, he soon struck up a friendship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and fought alongside her for the rights of unionized workers across the whole country. Frank narrowly survived two separate attempts at lynching by strike breakers, once in Wisconsin and a second time in Montana. Two instances of nearly being murdered caused Frank Little to lay low for several years, only beginning to show his face again around the mine wars of the early 1920s. His political activism was less provocative, and he avoided any more near-death experiences until the outbreak of the civil war. Although too hold to fight personally, Frank helped organize a series of militias across the Steel Belt, and was later nominated to serve in the new government. From this position, he could launch a campaign for the presidency, which the elderly union man narrowly won."
POLITICS_HARRY_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Harry Bridges was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1901. When he turned 15, he was first introduced to radical labor politics through the Australian branch of the IWW. Emboldened by his contacts with fellow socialists, along with seeing the general deplorable conditions of the poor around the world, he participated in his first general strike in Australia in 1917. Three years later, in 1920, he would move permanently to the US due to the more plentiful work there. He settled in San Fran where he joined other local activists in reviving the then-defunct International Longeshoremens Association. In 1934 a period of month-long negotiations between the twenty local branches of the ILA and the dock owners of SF broke down when two longshore workers were murdered. Bridges, the leading negotiator for the ILA during the standoff, convinced over 100 San Francisco unions to join together in a General Strike. The ILA fought the city to a standstill, and Harry Bridges was given credit for stopping further police violence. His later Presidential campaign often faced off against protesters who defied the new Amendment giving natural born citizenship to immigrants, and prevailed against them. Using this reputation, he launched a risky but successful campaigned that has lead him to the presidency."
POLITICS_FRANK_JOHNS_DESC:0 "Initially a carpenter from Oregon, Frank Johns became the leading figure of the regional Socialist Labor Party. Running twice for congress and twice for the presidency, Johns seemed doomed to a lifetime of obscurity as a fringe party candidate. That was until he went through a near death experience in 1928, nearly drowning in an attempt to save a young boy whom had fallen in a frigid river. Forced to retire from the Socialist Labor Party in order to recover from the incident, Johns was given enough time to think and plot out a new career. He began to correspond with several members of the Socialist Party of America, and after being released from the hospital he went on to join them as a fiery orator. Emboldened by his heroism and having narrowly avoided death, Johns later threw himself into the second American civil war as a capable and courageous militia leader. Thanks to his military accomplishments and personal reputation, he has now finally been elected president, of a whole new America!"
POLITICS_SEYMOUR_STEDMAN_DESC:0 "It was incomprehensible to many that a simple janitor would go on to become one of the Socialist Party of America's most prominent activists and legal advisers. Initially balancing his job as a janitor at the Northwestern University School of Law with taking evening classes, Stedman managed to pass the bar to became a lawyer in 1891. Although he was at first a democrat, the young Stedman became inducted into socialism when he helped defend Eugene V Debs during American Railway Union's great strike. His lifelong friendship to Debs saw him chosen as the SPA's vice presidential candidate on 1920, and after Debs' death he became a close advisor to Jack Reed. Having now outlived yet another close comrade, the old and somber Stedman has run a successful race to become the new president, intent on honoring his old friend's utopian dreams."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_RODRIGUEZ_DESC:0 "The son of a Spanish immigrant to Illinois, William Rodriguez made his living painting houses, until he could eventually afford to pursue a legal degree. Inspired by his brother in law, a radical journalist named J. Louis Engdahl to join the American Socialist party and move to Chicago. The young Rodriguez managed to win a race for the Chicago city council as a dark horse candidate, becoming the first socialist and first Hispanic to sit on the council. He soon managed to use his newfound position to attack the city's transit companies and to seek legal reforms. Although eventually ousted by a democratic and republican unity candidate, Rodriguez did not give up on politics. He continued to practice law and ran a successfully campaign in 1933 to become a judge. Building on a lifetime of legal and political experience, his next triumph came when he ran his most recent successful presidential campaign."
POLITICS_MORRIS_HILQUIT_DESC:0 "One of the oldest political figures in the Combined Syndicates, Hillquit was born in 1869, to a Jewish family living in Latvia. After his father lost his business, the young Morris and his dad crossed the Atlantic in search of a better life. Soon settled in the slums of New York, Hillquit would go on to found the Socialist Party of America alongside Victor Berger and Eugene V Debs. He ran for the senate in 1908 from New York City, garnering 21% of the votes. Despite this failure, he would later unsuccessfully run for mayor of NYC and afterwards help organize fellow socialist Meyer London's successful bid for congress. Despite suffering from numerous bouts of tuberculosis and frequent conflicts with the growing syndicalist wing of the SPA, Hillquit endured long enough to witness the revolution finally sweep through America. Although old and sickly, his seniority and eventful life has netted him a surprising victory in the latest presidential election. His age helped to invalidate dissenters who wanted a natural born citizen as President. Although some remain uncertain if he can finish his current term, President Hillquit has sworn he will serve the interests of all of America's proletariat, no matter his age or health."
POLITICS_EUGENE_DENNIS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Francis Xavier Waldron, and spending his early life as a laborer and IWW member in California, the young Waldron was driven into exile after the Californian Criminal Syndicalist Act nearly saw him imprisoned for revolutionary political activism. Fleeing to the Commune of France and taking up work as minor union politician, he became an important link between the Socialist Party of America and the Third Internationale. In 1935 he returned across the Atlantic, now hiding under the pseudonym "Eugene Dennis", to help organize Jack Reed's campaign in the coming presidential election. His services to Reed were soon rewarded with a series of influential positions within the Combined Syndicates, which served as the stepping stones for his own eventually presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ELMER_ALLISON_DESC:0 "A self-taught radical from Missouri, Elmer Allison was a founding member of both the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. He was a leading figure in the SPA's radical Washington affiliate, spending much of his life either working in the local cedar mills or atop a soapbox in Seattle's streets. A series of raids and near arrests by the Department of Justice saw him go underground, but he remerged as a political figure when he helped lead the brief rebellion known as the Seattle Commune in 1923. During the Commune's existence he met Jack Reed, striking up a friendship with the famed journalist and following him to New York City. There he was a major figure in running Reed's numerous political campaigns and leading the SPA's entry into mainstream politics. Following the revolution, his close comradeship to Reed and his zealous socialist beliefs has made him an obvious candidate for the presidency. A candidacy he has gladly pursued!"
POLITICS_ELIZABETH_NORD_DESC:0 "Elizabeth Nord grew up as the daughter of a family of poor English coal miners, having to spend her early teenage years toiling in a silk factory. Her family departed England a few years shy of the British Revolution, settling across the Atlantic in Rhode Island. In the United States Nord spent another decade as a factory worker during which she used her political finesse and determination to rise through the ranks of her local union, being elected Chairwoman. She became one of the key leaders of the Great Textile Strike of 1934, organizing the walkout of tens of thousands of workers across the country. On the outbreak of the Second civil war, she was a political representative of her union in Washington D.C, but quickly made her way across the frontlines to the Combined Syndicates of America. Repeating the same grueling political maneuvering that put her in charge of the Great Textile Strike, Elizabeth Nord has now risen to lead something far greater than a union or a strike, she has become the new President!"
POLITICS_DAVID_DUBINSKY_DESC:0 "Dubinsky came from the former Russian Empire to America, a Polish Jew who had spent his early life organizing bunds, leading strikes and campaigning for the Bolsheviks. These actions netted him a prison sentence in Siberia, but the young Dubinsky managed to miraculously escape back to western Russia and catch a ship to carry him across the Atlantic. Spending much time working in the factories of New York City, Dubinsky became increasingly alienated from the union bureaucracy around him, starting a long-time personal feud between him and the IWW. He initially saw unions as inherently apolitical platforms that should seek further co-operation with the right wing to uplift all workers despite political beliefs, and that compromises with the federal government and business sector were practically mandatory for a union's success. Dubinsky would change his opinion after witnessing first the Great Depression, then the steady rise of Huey Long and finally the outbreak of the American civil war. Although he never made amends with the "union bureaucrats", Dubinsky ceased to compromise with the right wing and capitalism, taking on more politically extreme views. When the civil war finally ended he had been singing the praises of the new America, and already planted the seeds for a political career. Despite his controversial past, it appears David Dubinsky has now been able to reap what he has sown, rising to the position of President in spite of protests from old nativists who resist the proclamation giving him natural born rights."
POLITICS_JOHN_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The son of Welsh immigrants whom had settled in Iowa, John Lewis grew up in a company town dominated by the coal industry. At the age of 17 he went to work as a minister, becoming more and more embroiled in his hometown’s local politics and the nationwide labor movement. In 1907 he made a failed attempt to run for mayor, and later became a full-time union advocate who travelled across the steel belt. Although he initially bickered with William Z Foster over the merits of syndicalist trade unions compared to his preferred moderate and apolitical unions, the devastation of the Great Depression saw him slowly embrace more radical beliefs. Despite having once been a liberal and a republican, Lewis could not find it in his heart to endorse President Hoover's second term. Increasingly disillusioned with competitive capitalism, Lewis struck up negotiations with the Socialist Party of America and the IWW. When the American Revolution came, he had made up his mind for which side to stand on. Although his reactionary past continued to haunt him, Lewis eventually succeeded in finding a synthesis between radical unionism and his own moderate ideology, being elected as President in the latest election."
POLITICS_LUDWIG_KATTERFELD_DESC:0 "Born in Strasbourg under the German Empire and sent away to live with family in America at just 10 years of age, where he later ran away from home, Ludwig Katterfeld had a harsh and formative upbringing. After escaping his extended family, he took up work as a farmhand in Kansas, spending his teenage years balancing hard labour with honing his impressive oratory skills and sharp intellect. The next two decades were a turbulent time for Katterfeld, seeing him become a professed socialist and move from state to state to launch new political ambitions. After graduating college in 1910 he moved to Chicago and lead his own short-lived socialist party, the "Lyceum Bureau". He became involved with the Socialist Party of Washington and in 1916 launched a failed gubernatorial bid with them. In 1922 he was the provisional secretary of the Socialist Party of America, and later a representative in their behalf to the Third Internationale. It was in Paris he met Jack Reed, whom he accompanied back to America the very next year. In 1923 both men played a key role in the brief, radical Seattle Commune. The events of the commune compelled the bitter and austere Katterfeld to go underground, breaking with Reed's desire to go into mainstream electoral politics. From there on Katterfeld worked as an independent activist, not resurfacing until the Civil War. He did not have a chance to reconnect with Reed until the closing days of the revolution, with the latter on his deathbed. Compelled to honor his old friendship to Reed and armed with a lifetime of revolutionary experience, Katterfeld has launched into the spotlight with a narrow victory in the recent presidential race."
POLITICS_HENNING_BLOMEN_DESC:0 "A son of Massachusetts born in 1910, Henning was too young to experience the horrors of the Weltkrieg, but old enough to face the American Revolution in his prime. Initially an industrial worker in Cambridge, he was one of the few who did not leave his station the moment the first gunshots of the Second Civil War could be heard. A committed pacifist, Henning Blomen instead helped organize the chemical plant he worked at into a cooperative syndicate. His efforts were greatly appreciated by his more radical co-workers, who nominated him as a Massachusetts representative to the Combined Syndicates and helped him cross the front lines to New York City. Soon climbing his way up the political ladder, Henning Blomen has continuously made a name for himself with his unshakable optimism and iron will, running over a dozen major political races in his lifetime, the most recent of which has carried him all the way to the presidency."
POLITICS_JOHN_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Initially a French immigrant, Bernard worked nearly a decade of his life in the iron mines of Minnesota, later enlisting in the army. He served along the Mexican Border during the Mexican Revolution, a year later returning to Minnesota but soon discovering himself to be blacklisted from employment because his trade union activism. Pursuing a career in firefighting, then as a politician, Bernard managed to be elected to the House of Representatives on the ticket of the Farmer-Labor Party in 1936. While in office, he became more and more aligned with Jack Reed's popular front of socialists, and began to campaign for friendlier relations between America and the Commune of France. Distinguishing himself as a diligent proletariat and cunning politician, John Bernard has gone a step further and made a successful run for presidency."
POLITICS_OAKLEY_JOHNSON_DESC:0 "A voracious reader since an early age, Oakley Johnson took up a career within academia, serving as a teacher and later principal at numerous schools in his home state of Minnesota. This lasted until his commitment to radical politics became more publicly known, and he was arrested in the middle of a seminar over having contributed money to the defence fund of arrested IWW members. Undeterred, Johnson moved to New York and became a full time activist in the Socialist Party of America, helping to promote interracial relations and the education of the proletariat. In 1936 he accepted a position of Docent at a university in Paris, spending most of the coming Civil War abroad. In Paris he helped maintain diplomatic relations between the Commune of France and his comrades home in America. Eventually making the trip to the new America, Oakley Johnson has used his diplomatic accomplishments and academic merits to woo the electorate!"
POLITICS_BAYARD_RUSTIN_DESC:0 "Born in Pennsylvania, in the year of 1912, Rustin was raised in a family deeply affiliated with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He was personally acquainted with notables such as W.E.B. DuBois and James Weldon Johnson, developing left leaning beliefs at an early age. This best showed in 1936 when he organized a student strike at Wilberforce University, which he was expelled over. Cast adrift, the young Rustin moved to New York City where he joined the Young People's Socialist League and got to meet Norman Thomas and A. Phillip Randolph. With the outbreak of the civil war, Bayard Rustin became a political organizer and campaigner for the Combined Syndicates championing better race relations, increased desegregation, and the immediate overturning of Jim Crow in the newly liberated southern states. Now, decades after the revolution he has made his daring bid for the presidency despite the fact that Rustin's youth, skin color and known homosexual relationships have for long been targets of slander and ridicule. Although one might expect any one of those three to have stopped him, he has powered through regardless and been elected the first African-American head of state in American history."
POLITICS_DARLINGTON_HOOPES_DESC:0 "Darlington Hoopes came from a notable family of Pennsylvania Quakers, during his time at boarding school he augmented his religious upbringing with an interest in radical socialism, going on to identify as a Christian Socialist. His ideological beliefs soon drew him close to fellow Christian Socialist, Norman Thomas and the rest of the Socialist Party of America. In 1930, Hoopes was elected to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania, where his most celebrated accomplishment was completely outlawing child labor in his home state. Much like it did to Thomas, the outbreak of the civil war disgusted Hoopes. Although he could not deny its accomplishments in hindsight, his political cause after the war was to champion reconstruction and reconciliation between Americans. This benevolent, reformative platform earned him more and more influence in the new America, allowing him to make a bid for the presidency."
POLITICS_SMEDLY_BUTLER_DESC:0 "Marine, General and Senator Smedley Butler has done the unthinkable, in the revolution's darkest moment he has overthrown the would-be usurpers and traitors in the Centralist clique, and kept the flame of liberty alive. The old general has been an invaluable warrior for the Combined Syndicates, and his latest startling victory has endeared him to the population tenfold. Although Butler has confided to friends and political allies that he is uneasy to now be in the spotlight, he has agreed to taken on the job as the temporarily acting president of the new America until the scars torn open by totalism can once again be healed."

POLITICS_MANUEL_BISBE_DESC:0 "Among the founders of the Cuban Authentic Party, Manuel Bisbé Alberni and other more moderate members left the organisation shortly before the bloodbath of 1935, and like many other ex-Authentics, joined with the Unionistas. Rumors circulated during the Havana Strike that Bisbé was directly involved with some moderate dissident groups, and while such speculation was never confirmed, Bisbé's appointment to boss of the Unionista Party following Rafael Trejo's retirement was almost certainly motivated his favorability among the dissatisfied."
POLITICS_MARIO_GARCIA_MENOCAL_DESC:0 "President from 1913 to 1921, many Cubans look back on Menocal's time in office with great fondness. Before the scandals of Zayas and the tyranny of Machado, the man remains one of Cuba's most respected heads of state. Following the revolution of 1928 and worried with the nation's political direction, Menocal re-entered politics and was elected to the Cuban senate. There, he and his new National Democratic Association allied with the remenants of the old Liberal Party to oppose, at least ostensibly, the military and Unionistas alike."
POLITICS_RAMON_GRAU_MARTIN_DESC:0 "As a professor at the University of Havana's medical school, Grau with other dissidents within the faculty and student body to resist the rule of Gerardo Machado. While Grau was not directly involved in organizing the mass student protests which catalyzed the revolution of 1928, he and his supporters quickly emerged as a powerful political force in the chaotic time immediately thereafter. A staunch nationalist, he was far from satisfied with the post-revolutionary status quo and while he initially supported the Unionistas in their power struggle against the military, his fervor and ever-increasing disdain for the socialist-bloc led to his utilizing extra-legal means to achieve his goals. In cooperation with army officers disaffected with the leadership of General Diaz, Grau's politically convenient thugs grew into a radical bonafide paramilitary and Grau turned more and more from his democrat ideals, his anger growing with his authoritarianism.\nAmidst the chaos following the election of 1935, Grau, now operating from the countryside where government rule had all but collapsed, hardened into the man he is today; both an idealist and a tyrant, steadfast yet so quick to compromise his beliefs, Ramón Grau San Martín is a walking contradiction."
POLITICS_LAZARO_PENA_DESC:0 "The young Lazaro Peña succeeded Sandalio Junco as boss of the CNOC totally inexperienced. Peña's meteoric rise in the short time since caught many among even Cuba's left off guard. An advocate of complete collectivisation and industrial development, Peña wears the moribund label of 'communist' with pride. Despite this, the CNOC and its leadership both past and present, have both embraced many aspects of European syndicalism and paradoxically call for cultivation of a stronger Cuban national identity in an internationalist context."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GUITERAS_DESC:0 "As leader of the Cuban Socialist Party following the Cuban revolution of 1928, Guiteras was a thorn in the side of Cuba's military kingmakers and instrumental in the survival of the party and socialism in general in Cuba following the events of 1935. Now, as chairman of the broad 'Socialist Movement', successor to the old party, and President of Cuba, Guiteras will undoubtedly be equally involved in shaping the future of the nation. While Guiteras is a relatively orthodox syndicalist, he possesses his own unique ideological quirks which could be crucial to the nation's ultimate fortune."
POLITICS_JUAN_HERNANDEZ_DESC:0 "Often compared to Nicaragua's Sandino, Juan Blas Hernández waged a years-long guerilla war in Cuba's southern hills. He is first and foremost a man of the people, and more than willing to fight and bleed for the sake of the nation's least fortunate. Now in power, President Hernández seeks not only to live up to his grandiose rhetoric, but the larger-than-life reputation he has garnered among many in the Cuban peasantry."
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TREJO_DESC:0 "As a young law student at the University of Havana, Rafael Trejo González grew increasingly disillusioned with the authoritarian regime of Gerardo Machado Morales. He joined the newly founded anti-Machado 'University Student Directory', established along the lines of the defunct 'University Student Federation', as well as the equally disaffected 'Law Students Association'. By late 1927 he had become influential in the former and the President of the latter. Trejo's impassioned yet collected denunciations of Machado and his influence within the university as well as his close association with Socialist disciples of exiled former student leader, Julio Mella McPartland, led to his forced dismissal following pressure from Machado's government. In response, Trejo led demonstrations in Havana and with the support of elements of the Cuban Army, overthrew Machado. Thereafter, Trejo, with the support of the military under the presumption that he would be easily controlled on account of his age, was appointed President instead of his older colleagues within the new caretaker government. Despite becoming President of Cuba just after his 18th Birthday and amidst rising tensions between his more extreme coalition partners, Trejo effectively guided the nation through the tumultuous years that followed his revolution."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "The son of Cuba's second president, José Gómez, Miguel Gómez was first elected to national public office during the Machado era. While he begrudgingly followed the Liberal Party line and lent Machado his support, he was among the most vocal supporters within the legislature of the student demonstrations that toppled the Machado regime. Following the success of the student revolution and the collapse of the Liberal Party, Gómez founded the Republican Party along with other moderate members within the defunct Liberal Party's right-wing. Opposed to undue regulation, Gómez envisions a Cuba enriched by a flourishing financial sector and booming trade with the wider world."
POLITICS_CARLOS_MENDIETA_DESC:0 "Senate President Mendieta succeeded Clemente Vazquez as President of Cuba following the latter's assassination, and Vazquez's shoes have proven hard to fill. Regardless, Mendieta, though calls for reform abound, even from within his own party, attempts to maintain the character of the executive established under his authoritarian predecessor."
POLITICS_JOSE_BARNET_DESC:0 "Following a long and illustrious career as a diplomat, Jose Agrapino Barnet was appointed as President by an outgoing Carlos Mendieta. While many assumed his Presidency would be a fleeting 'lame duck', Barnet approaches his position with a degree of professionalism rarely seen in Cuba's cutthroat political atmosphere."
POLITICS_MARTIN_TAMAYO_DESC:0 "As a junior officer stationed near the Cuban Presidential Palace, Martin Diaz first came to prominence at the head of a contingent of soldiers who joined with the student revolution of 1928. Finding himself at the forefront of a rapidly coalescing faction within the military and granted the rank of General, the merely thirty year old Diaz soon became the most powerful individual in Cuba, even more influential in the nation's politics than the President himself. Now, years later as President in his own right, Diaz stands nearly unopposed as the luminous sun around which Cuban politics orbit."
POLITICS_CLEMENTE_VAZQUEZ_DESC:0 "Clemente Vazquez was among president Machado's closest confidants and the President of the Senate for most of Machado's tenure, and despite many close calls, survived multiple attempts of his life following Machado's downfall. Unlike so many of old Liberal party, Vazquez held fast to the authoritarian model for the presidency established by Machado. Thanks to American brokerage of several informal deals with General Diaz, Vazquez returned to Cuban politics after only a short stint laying-low in the American embassy, and quickly found his feet. As President, Vazquez continues to emulate his older mentor, and many Cubans find his rule to be nearly indistinguishable from that of Machado."
POLITICS_JULIO_MELLA_DESC:0 "Grandson of Dominican hero, Matías Mella, Julio Mella had his first run in with the law as a first year university student during the tenure of president Zayas. As President of the ideologically socialist University Students Federation, Mella attempted to resist the authoritarian regime of Gerado Machado. For this, he was exiled to Mexico for the next eleven years. Upon his return, Mella quickly re-established his position within the Cuban left and brought with him a new ideology known as 'transformationism' influenced by Mexican agrarian socialist strains of thought. As President, Mella seeks to turn Cuba into a model for 'transformationism' for the world, no matter the cost or who may attempt to stand in his way."
POLITICS_CARLOS_CESPEDES_DESC:0 "Carlos de Céspedes, son of the Cuban independence hero of the same name, spent decades in politics and the Cuban diplomatic service. While ostensibly loyal to Machado during that pivotal tyrant's tenure, Céspedes secretly worked to undermine his regime, coordinating closely with other disaffected Liberal party members. Soon after the student revolution, Céspedes returned to elected office with a stint in the Senate, wherein he founded the New Liberal Party to unite like-minded former Liberals who with the dissolution of the Liberal Party lacked any formal association. As president, Céspedes looks to return Cuba to the early days of the Zayas regime, without the alleged corruption of course, and with a consciousness for often overlooked social and political realities."
POLITICS_RAUL_ROA_DESC:0 "Grandson of a decorated Mambí, Raúl Roa first developed his revolutionary socialist ideals as a student activist against the regime of Gerado Machado. Upon his release from prison, he worked closely with extralegal socialist opposition groups and the ideologically mixed 'University Student Directory' at the University of Havana. While not a direct participant of the protests which precipitated Machado's ousting, he found a platform writing for various left-wing publications, gain a good degree of celebrity among Cuban socialists. While Roa was only appointed to the office of the Presidency as part of a compromise between Cuba's feuding socialist factions, he possesses a knack for leadership and public speaking beyond his years."
POLITICS_ALBERTO_BAYO_DESC:0 "Expelled from the Cuban Air corps for pistol-dueling another airman, Alberto Bayo joined the Spanish Legion and fought in that nation's colonial war in northern Morocco. Returning to Cuba in 1932 following the dissolution of the short-lived Spanish Republic, Bayo joined with the rebel Juan Blas, training guerillas to fly whatever small aircraft they managed to capture. Eventually, Bayo relationship with Blas grew to the extent that each man became the other's closest confident. With Blas's untimely 'departure' from the struggle, Bayo took up leadership of those who would still pledge their loyalty to the wider movement Blas had led."
POLITICS_SANDALIO_JUNCO_DESC:0 "A close associate of Julio Mella's and exiled along with him to Mexico in 1925, Junco managed to secretly return to Cuba after the Cuban student revolution and eventually rose to the leadership of the CNOC, which still retained the ideological character it had possessed in 1925. Despite working with other socialist groups out of necessity, Junco disagreed deeply with the ideology and personal character of other socialist leader such as Antonio Guiteras and Juan Blas. Eventually forced to step down from his position as chairman of the CNOC by disaffected younger members, Junco retained a large of degree of influence within the organisation and the 'Comunista' faction of the Cuban Socialist Movement. As President, Junco seeks total collectisation of land and the nation's rapid forced indutrial development."
POLITICS_TINA_MODOTTI_DESC:0 "Noted photographer of Italian origin, Tina Modotti, came to Mexico in 1922 to follow a Mexican lover. Years later, she met and, out of character with her history of moving from one affair to the next, eventually married Cuban exile, Julio Mella. Upon the Cuban socialist revolution, Modotti returned with her new husband to the island, helping to re-establish his political career from the moment her feet first touched Cuban soil. After climbing through the ranks of her husband's government, Modotti succeeded him upon his death, becoming Cuba's first female head of state. She remains committed to her husband's transformationist ideology and authoritarian style of governance."

## Dominican Republic ##
POLITICS_HEINRICH_GOLDBERG_DESC:0 "Heinrich Goldberg first came to prominence as the leader of a small anarchist commune on the outskirts of Berlin during the Weltkrieg and subsequent flight from the country to the then newly established Commune of France. While in France, his views became increasingly coloured by French orthodox syndicalism, and upon his departure for the Dominican Republic in 1928, he had become a fervent supporter of Emile Pouget\nIn the Dominican Republic, his early efforts to promote syndicalism were mostly ineffective, but he managed to cultivate a small and devoted following, becoming the face of the Syndicalist movement in his adopted country."
POLITICS_PERDRO_HENRIQUEZ_URENA_DESC:0 "While slandered by political opponents for his marriage to the sister of Mexican Syndicalist, Vicente Lombardo Toledano, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, son of former president Francisco Henríquez Carvajal, returned to the Dominican Republic after years abroad to a great degree of fanfare. Despite comparisons to his radical brother-in-law, however, Henríquez is by no means a syndicalist; the principled writer, is however, more than willing to work any across the political spectrum who subscribe to the view that the Dominican Republic, and indeed all of Latin America, should be entirely free of imperialist influence, and able to fully choose their own destiny."
POLITICS_JUAN_JIMENES_GRULLON_DESC:0 "Juan Jimenes Grullón, son of former president Juan Jimenes Pereyra, despite the decline of progressivism in the Dominican Republic during the American occupation, is a true believer of the ideals of his father's Jimenistas. The younger Jimenes entered politics soon after returning to the Dominican Republic in 1929 from Germany, and soon established a small but devoted following."
POLITICS_ESTRELLA_URENA_DESC:0 "Rafael Estrella Ureña, while ideologically a social and economic reformist, gained a great deal of infamy even before the American occupation for his seemingly endless ambition and lust for political power. Since the end of the occupation, Estrella's name has only become further tainted by his willingness to work closely with both the military and members of the nation's economic elite."
POLITICS_MARTINEZ_REYNA_DESC:0 "Virgilio Martínez Reyna was essential to the 1924 election of Horacio Vásquez Lajara as the Dominican Republic's first president since the American Occupation. In his own presidential tenure, he has been equally central to the nation's incessant political turmoil. While popular and far less corrupt than his predecessors, Martínez's failure to quell discontent amongst the nation's economic elite and even begin to address the political power of the Army precipitated the nation's political direction thereafter.\nIdeologically, Martínez draws heavily on a uniquely populous Catholic corporatism, and while indeed not entirely authoritarian, is more than willing to undermine the foundations of Dominican democracy if need be."
POLITICS_MANUEL_CONCHA_DESC:0 "Manuel Troncoso Concha, once a small-time corporate lawyer, came to public prominence through connections to General Rafael Trujillo. Often accused of being little more than a puppet for Trujillo, Troncoso's fate, despite his denial of such accusations, has become inexorably linked to that of the general."
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TRUJILLO_DESC:0 "A young Rafael Trujillo so impressed the occupying American Marine Corps. that he was hastily promoted to in the occupation Dominican Army. Trujillo used his position to amass warlordlike control over much of the country. So great was his power and ambition that the various administrations which followed the nation's independence in 1924 that each based much of its decisionmaking on preventing him from making a grab for power. Now in full control of the country as he has so long desired, Trujillo works closely with organized crime to line his pockets and strengthen quell descent. He also seeks to brng the tumultuous western border fully under control and eliminate the threat posed by Haitians there once and for all."
POLITICS_ERNESTO_BONETTI_DESC:0 "An aspiring lawyer, skilled baseball player, and the sport's most prolific patron in the Dominican Republic, despite his young age, Pilindo Bonetti threw his lot in with Trujillo early, proclaiming his support for the general before fawning crowds on multiple occasions. Now, after winning a presidential election that made few illusions to being fair or free, Bonetti does the general's bidding as little more than a puppet, doing his best to create the illusion of democracy in the Dominican Republic."
POLITICS_RAMON_VASQUEZ_DESC:0 "An early ally of Trujillo, General Ramon Vasquez Rivera is perhaps the most politically ambitious of The Chief's closest confidants. General Rivera was quick to seize the opportunity for political ascendence and now rules in the image of Trujillo."

Upon arrival in Delhi, Jehangir's father fell increasingly ill, and Jehangir assumed control of the Tata business empire. Jehangir personally financed counter-insurgency operations in the wake of the break-up of the Raj, and in the process, became increasingly involved in Dominion politics, eventually being appointed as chief of the Indian national bank."
POLITICS_ATUL_CHANDRA_CHATTERJEE_DESC:0 "Atul Chandra Chatterjee, diplomat and moderate labor activist, served diligently in the British Raj's 'Indian Civil Service'; he was the British High Commissioner to India when the British Revolution struck, and upended India's political system. His efforts were pivotal to the establishment of the Dominion's foreign service, even personally managing most of his nation's diplomats when issues arose. Following Viceroy Ganga Singh's appointment, Chatterjee became even more prominent in India politics, even striking up a friendship with Singh. Chatterjee has been a vocal advocate of state protection of the rights of India's industrial labourers."
POLITICS_SRINIVASA_SASTRI_DESC:0 "Srinivasa Sastri, who founded the Indian Liberal Party after leaving the Indian National Congress, is renowned for negotiating a degree of autonomy for India shortly before the British Revolution. Sastri, though once nearly incarcerated for his association with the Indian Home Rule League, and not opposed to India's recent declaration of a republic, is quite an anglophile; he believes that the institutions established by the British should be maintained."
POLITICS_MINOCHER_MASANI_DESC:0 "Minocher Rustom Masani, a vocal proponent of classical liberalism, split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's drift towards socialism. Masani is a charismatic and good-natured man, who, despite policy disagreements, maintains personal friendships with many political rivals, even those of the Indian National Congress. Minocher similarly enjoys even the most mundane of political decision, often speaking for hours on end on the floor of parliament on the minutia of financial decisions and administrative budgets. Minocher's attention to detail and gregarious nature has won him a large political following."
POLITICS_NARASIMHA_KELKAR_DESC:0 "Narasimha Chintaman Kelkar split with the Indian National Congress due to the Congress's increasingly socialist stance. Shortly before the disintegration of the British Raj, Kelkar, and other more liberal Congress defectors founded the Swaraj (meaning independence or self-governance) Party to promote parliamentarian democracy in India. Kelkar is not only a man of politics, however; he is an accomplished playwright, and his works have been responsible for igniting increased national identity and political consciousness among the people of India."

Kher rose in political prominence by advocating for the protection of the rights of India's lower castes, and it is from these lower caste's that he draws the greatest support.

Though once a member of the Indian National Congress, Munshi bears a disdain for socialism, and abandoned the Congress due to its leftward drift. Munshi believes that to assure liberty for the people of India and safeguard against the encroachment of insidious socialist influence, property rights must be protected, while the estates of India's landed aristocracy must be broken up."

With the death of his political ally, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Menon was forced to step out from the shadows, and become the face of the moderate left in India.

POLITICS_CHHOTU_RAM_DESC:0 "Chhotu Ram, after helping to found the Unionist Party, withdrew from politics to focus on social work. Ram's work led to a marked increase in the standard of living of some of the most destitute people of Punjab, and the name 'Chhotu Ram' was soon on the lips of a great many Indians.

Despite Zhang's best efforts an economically unstable home front, German intervention, and Wu Peifu's military genius have seen him again contained to the provinces north of the Great Wall. He has been stoking old ambitions ever since, converting his formerly regionalist administration into a bastion of republicanism, claiming direct lineage from the Xinhai Revolution. His actual commitment to democratic principles remains to be seen.\nDespite his poor literacy and lack of a formal education, the 'Old Marshal' is capable and self-aware leader, happy to seek advice and delegate where necessary to cover his deficiencies. However, he is also known for a short temper and an unforgiving nature, readily holding deep grudges. Zhang is also sometimes greatly self-centred, formerly crashing the entire Northeastern economy to support his war efforts, and so in ideological terms he could be called staunchly 'Pro-Zhang'."

After securing governorship of Manchuria, Zhang went on to fight a series of wars with the Anhui and Zhili Cliques, at times extending his influence as far south as Shanghai. Despite Zhang's best efforts an economically unstable home front, German intervention, and Wu Peifu's military genius have seen him again contained to the provinces north of the Great Wall. He has been stoking old ambitions ever since, converting his formerly regionalist administration into a bastion of republicanism, claiming direct lineage from the Xinhai Revolution. His actual commitment to democratic principles remains to be seen.\nDespite his poor literacy and lack of a formal education, the 'Old Marshal' is capable and self-aware leader, happy to seek advice and delegate where necessary to cover his deficiencies. However, he is also known for a short temper and an unforgiving nature, readily holding deep grudges. Zhang is also sometimes greatly self-centred, formerly crashing the entire Northeastern economy to support his war efforts, and so in ideological terms he could be called staunchly 'Pro-Zhang'."

POLITICS_LEONIDAS_MATOS_DESC:0 "Leônidas Antero de Mattos is a native of Cuiabá, born in 1894 and as all so usual for the upper class then, graduated in law school before moving into politics, while his brother João Antero de Mattos joined the military. A staple figure in state governments of Mato Grosso since the Interstate War, he has been awarded many varying stations and administrative positions, some say all the while lining his pockets. While the role of leading the newly founded Republic of Goyaz is an unpleasant one, especially with the powerful Caiado family jostling for power constantly, Leonidas certainly believes that cooperation, at least for now, is the best way to ensure the prosperity of his home."
POLITICS_RAMIRO_NORONHA_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "While a relatively low ranking officer before the beginning of hostilities, Ramiro Noronha has since established himself as one of the most well known service men in the lands now controlled by Goyaz. As to seek a quick pacification of the hinterlands, his expertise as many times garrison leader and interventor in the region is now at the service of the newly founded republic, in a role that he certainly did not predict when he enrolled into military service as a young man. Now having to deal with grumbling oligarchs and syndicalist protests, Noronha himself fears he may no be entirely qualified to the task laid before him, but is determined to establish order first, before any reconsidering of strategic options."
POLITICS_JARI_GOMES_GOY_DESC:0 "Born in 1913 in the riverine city of Corumbá, Jari Gomes graduated in medical school, but has been more active as a poet and politician since then. After following the all to familiar climb of city councillor, state and then federal representative, Jari is one of the most influential politicians in what is now the Goyaz Republic, and has been chosen as it's first president, in a move some claim is a direct attempt to curtail the influence of the Caiado family in regional politics. The stage is set for a new chapter in the ever changing landscape of this land's politics, and few can predict if President Jari will come out on top internally, but his foreign backing certainly has most oppositors moving cautiously."
POLITICS_TOTO_CAIADO_DESC:0 "The recent political history of the state, and then the Republic of Goyaz is almost entirely the history of the extremely wealthy and powerful Caiado family, and those few and brave enough to oppose their immense political power. Even as it transitioned into an independent nation, Antônio José Caiado, also known as Totó, is by far the most powerful man in the land, as the head of the family and all its properties and influence. While some could call dealing with foreign occupiers dubious, there are few things the family would not do to maintain its grip on local politics, which has admittedly weakened ever since the democratic reforms in the wake of the interstate war. Now assuming direct control of government and with powerful foreign backers, few can even see a future where the Caiados don't rule Goyaz."
POLITICS_CANDIDO_RONDON_HOS_GOY_DESC:0 "Almost a living legend in Goyaz's northern reaches, and all of the former Brazilian lands as a whole, Candido Rondon is a die hard republican who spent decades of effort to connect, explore and map the large western reaches of Brazil. Usually not one to meddle in political affairs, Rondon knows these lands better than any man ever has in history, and he will not give up the fight for his republican values, even in the dire situation all of former Brazil finds itself in. Some, however, claim him to be broken and tired man, that gave up his fighting spirit for the safety of the people in the region."
POLITICS_CHICO_AQUINO_GOY_DESC:0 "His Revered Excellency Francisco de Aquino Correia was born in 1885 in Cuiabá, and is the chief religious authority and intellectual in the region. Having dabbled in politics since 1917, Francisco knows that the role of the church in the hinterlands is more than a spiritual one, but one of guidance and guard against the ever present threats of the material world, such as the temptation of atheism and discrimination. While he was at a point had something of a common cause with integralists in Brazil, his relative lack of enthusiasm for the monarchist movement caused him to fall into the wayside of that movement, but has since admitted that dealing with those radicals was a mistake borne of fears of a rise in syndicalism. While he is respected among both the people and his peers, he will have much to endeavour in stabilizing the newly established republic, especially when it comes to curbing the ever growing influence of the Caiado family of the capital."
POLITICS_PEDRO_LUDOVICO_GOY_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Goyaz, Pedro Ludovico Teixeira completed his studies in Rio de Janeiro before returning to his home, where quickly began a political career, positioning himself against the state oligarchs, the Caiado family. While initially left leaning politically, the failures of the ED and the street violence that even reached his city during the 1936 elections have drifted him towards a more liberal-democratic point of view. His main goal while at the helm of the republic is one that has defined his political career, his long standing desire for a better and more developed Goyaz, even if his ideas on how to reach said goal have changed quite a bit over the years. As he now takes the helm of an independent and free Goyaz, he can finally set his development plans into motion, and while some powerful families will likely stand in his way, naturally including the Caiado, he has confidence that his foreign backing gives him a secure position to negotiate."
POLITICS_PONCE_ARRUDA_GOY_DESC:0 "A civil engineer by trade, João Ponce de Arruda is not exactly the kind of man who typically takes on the protagonist role in socialist states. While he always was a left winger, he never saw himself as a radical, but as a moderate, and this position and his influence in the region have allowed himself to present himself as the best possible head for a transitional government as the newly established republic gets back on its feet, as the war demolished what little infrastructure remained. Born in Cuiabá in 1904, he also both blood and friendship ties to many of the states notables, and seeks to ensure a stable transition; but many of the powerful families in the region still believe themselves in a position above the new government, which is bound to cause issues for the young nation."
POLITICS_APOLLONIO_GOY_DESC:0 "Apolônio de Carvalho is one of the most notable military servicemen to have joined political life in the left wing, having had a long and distinguished career in the Brazilian military after he left his home in Corumbá to serve. He joined the ranks of the ED around the time of the 1936 elections, urged by fellow officers to act on his desire to bring meaningful change to the nation. With the war that devastated the former nation now in the past, Apolônio certainly is a proactive politician, as he and many other fellow left-leaning officers feel that the changes in the structure of the country must be done in a swift and decisive fashion, and not doing so risks both lives and the safety of the future success of the newborn republic. His political stances also are a lot closer to traditional french ideals than the general heterodoxical ideas of most officers in the army. As a military man, he also believes in a proactive foreign policy to safeguard the interests of world revolution."
POLITICS_HEITOR_LIMA_GOY_DESC:0 "Heitor Ferreira Lima was born in the city of Corumbá in Mato Grosso, but he moved to Rio de Janeiro while still relatively young, in 1922. He started working as a tailor and joined the local syndicalist movements, and became one of the three youngsters chosen there to study in Paris under the auspices of the Third Internationale. There he turned into a true scholar of economic and social theory, and has since dedicated his life for the workers of the world. Now tasked with the role of leading his birthplace to a better future, he has to face off not only against the elements, but the quasi-feudal resistance against any kind of modernization efforts that is well entrenched within the newly formed state. However, the internationalist nature of the man means he will not hesitate to call in foreign help to deal with any open unrest, a fact the wisest members of the opposition to the communard government recently established have to always keep in mind."

POLITICS_BARATA_AMA_DESC:0 "Joaquim de Magalhães Cardoso Barata was born in 1888 in Belem, and has served with distinction in the Brazilian army for decades. He is however more well known for his multiple tenures as an administrator in the state, as he is the leader of the local military faction in that state that supported São Paulo in the interstate war. His tenures were usually stable, even during election year he often found himself at odds with other major political factions and actions, such as his main rivals in the Sodré family, who accused Barata of voter fraud on multiple occasions, but the political union with Amazonas and other northern states should give him some more room to maneuver. As president of Pará, Barata is also commander-in-chief, and his influence with the newly formed military should not be underestimated, for he has taken a close attention to the formation of this military force. Having for so long struggled to maintain political control of the region, Barata now finally has Pará marching under the beat of his drum."
POLITICS_LAURO_SODRE_HOS_AMA_DESC:0 "Lauro Nina Sodré e Silva had left political behind him after the interstate war, but the current situation of Pará as an independent nation brought him back to the forefront, this time as its head of state, not merely as its governor. Born in Belém in 1858, the old man is more than just a powerful and veteran politician, but also perhaps the oldest active politician in Pará. Also a military man, like many of the leaderships in Brazil during the times of the old republic, he took part in the Vaccine Revolt in Rio, being arrested in the process, and after that, continued his career as a multiple time representative for his state in that city. While his years may be running out, he is preparing the new republic's political system to stay aligned with his family and allies, while also balancing foreign demands and repairing wartime damage to the vital portuary infrastructure across the states he now rules over."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_FACIOLA_AMA_DESC:0 "A true captain of the old guard, Antônio de Almeida Facióla's political career all the way back in the 1880s, and has not left the game since, even at his advanced age. While some opposition members claim that having a president with ''one foot in the grave'' is dangerous for Parense democracy, the multiple times state president of Pará political power cannot be denied, even if his body fails him more and more frequently in the past few years, as with any man in his eighties. While he wields significant clout at his former political arena, the ''old man president'' doesn't really have a strong degree of influence in Amazonas or the smaller territories, and may find himself having issues actually ruling the nation's disparate political factions; as his position as it's first president is to a great degree based on foreign appointment rather than his own efforts."
POLITICS_ALVARO_BOTELHO_MAIA_AMA_DESC:0 "Born on the edge of Rio Madeira in the outskirts of the city of Humaitá, Álvaro Botelho Maia moved while still young the provincial capital of Manaus to finish his studies, and quickly found himself involved in local newspapers and later followed on into politics, but he is also a poet and a writer in his free time. While his career so far has been a string of relative unimportant appointed positions in smaller territories of the defunct Brazilian government, his growing frustration of his lack of power to properly reform the northern reaches of the country was immense even before the war, and now he sees himself in a prime position to modernize Grão Pará's still young economy, education and political infrastructure. However, being both a reformer and not of a traditional political family puts him in a collision course with powerful landowners and rubber barons, and he will have to spend significant effort to see these changes through even with foreign backing."
POLITICS_EFIGENIO_SALE_AMAS_DESC:0 "Hailing from the town of Serro in Minas Gerais, Efigênio Ferreira de Salles was at the helm of the state of Amazonas at the start of the interstate war, and when the news of the war reached the north, he opted for a 'wait and see' stance, which resulted in him being ousted from office after the rebels successfully ousted president Bernardes on that occasion; since then, he occupied relatively minor positions as a representative and worked as a teacher, his primary job for much of his life. However, the result of the war Brazil found itself in has made his political destiny take another unexpected turn, as he is now the president and head of state of the newly founded republic of Grão Pará, a position both powerful and precarious, as his influence in Belém and outside of Amazonas in general is severely limited, especially after so many years out of the upper echelon of the great game. However, his experience, allies in Manaos and foreign backing almost ensure that in any contentious matters, his voice will be the last one heard and the one truly heeded in the young republic."
POLITICS_LANDRY_SALES_AMA_DESC:0 "A native of Acaraú and born in 1904, Landry Sales Gonçalves started his career as a military officer, and both took part on rebellions back in the Old Republic and interacted with several key figures of the tenentist uprisings that would follow. While did flirt with the AIB during the rise of that party, he since has adopted more classical liberal stances in detriment of militarism political thought, and has been elected president with great support from fellow officers in campaigning. His outlook towards politics also changed over the years, and he is more in favour of de-escalating tensions and a generally less active role of active officers in political affairs. While he is not a native to the lands of the north, he spent most of the past decade occupying administratie posts in Pará, and thus has chosen it as his hope for the time being, while also fostering good relations with the republic of his birthplace to the west. He has a big task ahead of him, as the already diminutive amount of infrastructure of these riverlands may take decades to repair, but Landry is used to both the harsh life of the barracks and the ever shifting loyalties of politics."
POLITICS_AMA_POMAR_DESC:0 "Pedro Ventura Felipe de Araújo Pomar lived certainly an unorthodox childhood, having moved to New York from his home state of Pará while aged 5, living there for two years before returning to his small birth time of Obidos, and then moving to the state capital of Belem. He started to act politically at age thirteen, supporting the rebel cause in the interstate war quite publically, but later on he moved further and further left as he reached adulthood, becoming a full blown socialist by age 20; he spent these youth years studying for medical school, and as a part time footballer for Clube do Remo. A calm and collected man, Pedro often remains quiet in political gatherings, only occasionally inferring in rare points, and has a usually positive and likeable demeanour, which resulted in his relative popularity among trade union members, despite his somewhat young age; now, he is faced with the immense challenge of leading a nation that is just as young as him, and faces immense hurdles of infrastructure and budget. While these concerns are certainly worrisome, he believes that with the support of the people, socialism can flourish even here, in the banks of the Amazon basin."
POLITICS_CLAUDIO_SANTORO_AMA_DESC:0 "Claudio Franco de Sá Santoro was born in Manaus in 1919, and is an extremely renowned musician and composer. His career in music began while still young, but his involvement with the Internationale is just as old, as he often found his colleagues involved with syndicalist and leftist organizations even from very early. His appointment to the position of first head of state of his new country is a recognition of his career in both of those fields, but also an immense responsibility, as the riverine republic has to repair the immense wartime damage, both administrative and in infrastructure, while also dealing with the powerful and avaricious landowners who see Claudio as a foreign collaborator, and will stop at nothing to keep the people ignorant and to ransack of the world's greatest forest of its riches. Dealing with these opponents may well be a complicated matter for the young socialist, who is still seen as excessively hopeful and naive, and perhaps may require foreign intervention."
POLITICS_AMA_JOAO_AMAZONAS_DESC:0 "Born in Belém in 1919, João Amazonas de Souza Pedroso's involvement with politics and the socialist movement began relatively recently, in 1932, during one of the first actions of the newly founded Democratic Left in his hometown. While initially a social democrat, as the years went by he drifted further left, frustrated with the power the landowners had over democratic institutions and growing more and more cynical of the capacity of democracy to bring real change to his home. Now, he is in a position to do much more after the liberation of Brazil, as the head of state and chairman of his homeland, and bring the modern age to Pará as a whole; and this time, it's the landowners who are at the mercy of the proletariat, and not the other way around. In due time, he hopes, the lands around the river he was named for will become known as a shining example of socialist success and prosperity."

POLITICS_OSVALDO_LIMA_GRP_DESC:0 "Osvaldo Cavalcanti da Costa Lima Filho was born in the town of Cabo de Santo Agostinho, is a young and energetic right wing radical and former member of the AIB. His political career began as early as 1936, where he partook in the street battles in Recife against syndicalist rabbles, and has since become one of the key agitators of Integralist ideology in the region. While he, like many integralists in the northeastern part of Brazil, never held any significant monarchist beliefs, the movement enjoyed his support as he saw the republic as little more than a failed experiment in its current state. Being a law graduate, Osvaldo wishes to re-establish the rule of law cross the Confederation; and to do so, he prepares an extensive plan of investigations and arrests against traitors and terrorists, some of whom have roamed the nation freely for decades. To this end, he is organizing a reformed secret police department, backed by the remnants of integralist militias, whose members still remember their faith and duty to God, and will not hesitate to carry out this regrettable yet necessary task to establish peace in the newly founded republic."
POLITICS_GOIS_NRD_DESC:0 "Born in the town São Luís do Quitunde, Alagoas, in 1889 , Pedro Aurélio de Góis Monteiro is a member of an influential family of military servicemen who occupied powerful positions in the old order's army. His army career began in the school of war in Porto Alegre, and he relatively quickly climbed the ranks of the military in Brazil. His position politically has always been marked by legalism, and his brother Cícero Augusto died in combat the Interstate War. But he also is defined by a strong bias against syndicalist and socialist views, which he saw as the primary threat to civilization as a whole across the world. While his position as leader of the Confederation is none one he picked himself, he is determined to establish the rule of law by any means necessary, and he enjoys widespread support for this endeavour in the recently organized national army, as the military in the region has traditionally shifted towards the right wing. The main issue while he is president however will be the many differing powerful political factions and oligarchs that have traditionally wielded power in each individual states; these coroneis will stop at nothing to increase their influence, even if this damages the overall goals of self sustainability and army reform the president defends."
POLITICS_WHITECASTLE_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco was born in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceará, in 1897, and completed his military studies in Porto Alegre, in the far south. He occupied the post of a military instructor in Rio during the Interstate War, and sided with the rebels like many other mutinous officers. Being on the winning side brought him many political advantages, and by 1936 he was an army major and one of the most influential servicemen in the nation. His most standout political belief is the strong opposition to any kind of syndicalist or socialist principles, and he always defended open war against any kind of internationalist regime as necessary to maintain peace and order. To him, syndicalists are enemies of freedom no matter what treaties they sign, and they seek to undermine the values of the nation as a way to replace them with the beliefs of Marx. This disposition might have had him in friendly terms with the AIB, were it not for his relatively strong republican beliefs. Now as the appointed president of the newly formed federation, the most pressing matters of rebuilding the administrative and transport infrastructure must at least for now take precedence over the enforcement of his planned anti-socialist and anti-union legislation."
POLITICS_COFFEE_JR_GRP_DESC:0 "Born in Natal in 1899, João Fernandes Campos Café Filho performed as a young man the typical path of Brazilian politics, working on journalism and studying law before managing a spot in local legislatures, but with the key difference of having played football professionally for Alecrim FC during the waning years of the Weltkrieg. Having positioned himself strongly in favour of the opposition in the interstate war, Café holds a strong belief in modernizing the country, but also in demoratic principles he often found were seldom respected by his peers in the old brazilian legislatures. A presbyterian protestant, Cafe Filho is a part of a minority in the intensely catholic Guararapes, but despite what foreign observers might infer, it's an extremely secondary matter, for his biggest issue when taking the rulership of the federation will be the local elites, the coroneis, whose influence and wealth made them historical political kingmakers in the region. He, however, counts as his ally the extremely influential João Pessoa, and has significant, even if broad, popular support for his democratic and liberal ideals."
POLITICS_CAVALCANTI_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "While born in the small town of Palmeira dos Índios, Newton de Andrade Cavalcanti moved away from home quite young to pursue a military career, and he was quite successful in it. A distinguished and talented officer, he had already become a high ranking officer by the time of the interstate war, and by that point was an army major and one of the most respected servicemen nationwide. His respected position and political moderation compared to most high ranking officers made him a natural choice for leader of the federation, as the war left a wake of lawlessness, anarchy and damaged infrastructure that may take decades to repair without intense foreign aid, something that doesn't seem quite likely. His republican beliefs frequently put him at odds with some radical integralist officers; while he today denies any ties with the movement, he did have some slight sympathy for their actions against syndicalist movements, even if not for their monarchism. While he usually distanced himself from political stations, he is now the guardian of democracy in the region, as the coroneis, disgruntled integralists and the ever looming syndicalists all threaten the fragile federal order in the states of Guararapes."
POLITICS_JOAO_PESSOA_GRP_DESC:0 "João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque is perhaps the most powerful man in all of the states that forms Guararapes, his career, popularity and political clout all almost unparalleled. Having led what is considered by many to be the most successful presidential term in the history of Brazil's republic, being multiple times state president of Parahyba and led the state governors of the region as a bloc for a decade. Born in the small town of Umbuzeiro, João later moved to several different major cities, having graduated in law in the University of Recife, and lived for times in places such as Rio. He rapidly climbed the political ladder, and soon rose to the prominent position is is now widely known for. His immense credibility is why he leads the confederation; while legally could not be president of Brazil again after his term, this is an entirely different entity, and he hopes to stabilize the newly founded republic, but also secure its prosperity and repair the extensive wartime damage across the country; but he will have to face stiff opposition from coroneis and other oligarchs across the nation, even if most state presidents of the federation are his allies."
POLITICS_JOSE_AMERICO_DE_ALMEIDA_GRP_DESC:0 "José Americo de Almeida was born in the small town of Areia, Parahyba, in 1887, and became a public prosecutor in the city of Souza, in that same state, shortly after graduating from law school, and became state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the administration his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While his appointment as head of state may be seen as surprising, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire union of Guararapes, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_RACHEL_QUEIROZ_GRP_DESC:0 "Perhaps better known for her activities as an author, journalist, teacher and translator, Rachel de Queiroz mostly represents the interests of her unions than that of any established political movement in the modern post revolutionary landscape, as she never had a very deep connection with leftist cliques. Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the newly founded socialist congress, with the backing of several cearense delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialization programs, or building huge railways across the nation."
POLITICS_CRIS_CORDEIRO_GRP_DESC:0 "Hailing from the small town of Limoeiro, Cristiano Cordeiro started his career in public services early, working at the state treasury while still a law student at the University of Recife. A veteran of the syndicalist movement in Brazil, Cristiano was one of the founding members of the PSB, and worked in organizing strikes both big and small in Recife for decades, while also acting in defense of the workers as a city councillor and other minor legislative positions. While he himself always positioned himself against a revolution enforced by military means, he nevertheless is the greatest syndicalist leadership in the states that form the federation, and thus was selected by it's unions as it's first chairman, while also receiving support from foreign syndicalists. His key policies are centred against combating hunger and extreme poverty that have devastated the states of the north ever since colonial times, but he also holds stances in favour of defending the rights and lands of the native peoples, who were the primary victims of the feudalistic practices of the local powerful landowners, the coroneis."
POLITICS_DJALMA_GRP_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the liberation and break-up of the states, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Guararapes's new, socialist government. His main goal is to improve the living standards of the people of this historically poverty-stricken land, especially those of the peasantry, who's ever growing vulnerability to droughts and food shortages caused mass migrations throughout the last four decades. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."

During the occupation, Borno, with the approval of Marine General John Russell and the United States, managed to eliminate Haiti's crippling debts, complete unprecedented infrastructure projects, and stabilise the country's political turmoil. With the end of the occupation amidst renewed unrest, Borno was allowed to retain the presidency.\nDeeply Catholic and despite his willingness to work with the United States, Borno's authoritarian reign has also seen a good deal of social change, especially regarding the status of Kreyol. As he looks to the future, the aging President Borno is faced with threats to his rule both from within Haiti and without, and his successes and failures alike will undoubtedly shape Haiti's future political landscape for years to come."

Upon his return to Ireland in 1923 he received a hero's welcome from Irish syndicalists and took control of the Labour Party, hoping to launch a syndicalist rising as in France over disappointments with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. The rising was a failure with informers revealing the plans of the ICA rebels beforehand and the Labour Party was banned, leading Larkin to go into hiding with the help of the Commune of France.

On his personal pilgrimage on a horse with no name, he observed the changing world of warfare in Egypt and Constantinople. He returned to Ha'il not in a tawb, but in a fashionable black uniform ordered from Germany. Now that Saud bin Abdulaziz is dead, his son has determined to avenge his family and end the Saud feud once and for all."
POLITICS_GHAZI_DESC:0 "The only son of the late Faisal bin Hussein, Ghazi escaped the wrath of the Turks in Hejaz by hiding in El Esah with his cousin Zeid bin Hussein. In El Esah, Ghazi was cared for by the remaining forces of Lawrence's rebellion, but financial assistance from Britain dried up in 1926. This left Ghazi to seek protection from Ottoman soldiers with the Howietat. This led to a temporary truce between the Rashids and the Hashmites when the Howietat were admitted into Jabal Shammar. The influence of Ghazi's name is still strong, as well as the legacy of the Arab Revolt among Bedouins yearning for freedom. Thus, it was Ghazi's triumphant return to Mecca after the fall of the Ottomans that restored the greatness of his name."
POLITICS_SAEED_DUBAI_DESC:0 "Where war and rivalry only led to the stagnation of Arabia, trade and deleation will restore. This came from a speech given by the Emir Saeed al Maktoum upon receiving his office. His term as Emir of Dubai was one of exemplary diplomacy and a care for his peoples' wellbeing. Submission to the Sauds over a bloodbath in the 1920s, creation of economic ties to India when pearling failed the emirate, and finally a promise of peace. His dynasty being unilaterally more wealthy than the Rashids or Hashmitie may of helped as well."
POLITICS_SHAKBUT_IRQ_DESC:0 "The House Al Nahyan was stuck in the crossroads of the Saud Rashid war. Their cities taxed cruelly by the Sauds, and thier commerce stunted. This destruction resolved Shakhbut Al Nahyan to formulate an economic plan for recovery involving western economists. This plan was presented to the Emirs, and early successes paved the way to Shakhbut's election. Al Nahyan weaves in his speeches the tales of how his ancestors of the Bani Yas migrated to the coast and found a land suitable to grow. Shakhbut's personal reputation among the Emirs is outstanding, and is only corrupted by the schemes of his own family. Shakhbut is confident that his reputation can save him from the machinations of family politics."
POLITICS_ABTAN_IRQ_DESC:0 "Atban was the one-time rival and now successor to the famous soldier and Sheikh Auda abu Tayi. When Auda's ambitons failed, he retreated from Aqab into the Al Nefud. The Howietat's livestock starved, wells were denied to them. In desperation Atban ibn Jazi choose to again put aside his rivalry for the sake of thier people and seek aid from the Rashids. This bid was successful, and Atban became the representative of the Howietat. Auda's and his reputations for joining the Arab Revolt and facing the harshest of the Turkish reprisals made Atban a surprisingly good candidate for Emir. Atban challenged the Emirs to live among their own, and was rewarded with cooperation."
POLITICS_SABAH_IRQ_DESC:0 "The Emirs of Kuwait began the century by setting the Rashid Saud conflict in motion, and it has finally paid off for them with the ascension of Jabe Al Sabah. It was Jaber's father who gave the Sauds arms and men in 1906 to retake Riyadh, a decision that would come back to haunt his son. The Ikhwan, Ibn Sauds frenzied soldiers attacked Kuwait when the British left, leaving devestation along the 1st Ring Road. Al Sabah prostrated himself to the Rashids, who forgave him and announced their protection of Kuwait. Now the Sabah are owed favors from the Rashids accrued during wartime, who exchanged this debt for a promise to elect Jaber al Sabah. Jaber himself reminding the emirs that he was first into battle on his horse against the Sauds, and that he alone could lead the charge against the Ottomans."

POLITICS_BAKR_SIDIQI_DESC:0 "Unlike many Kurds that joined the Ottoman Army's special Hamidiye units, Bakr Sidqi joined the general army alongside Arabs in after training in Istanbul. This slot allowed him to gain allies within the Ottoman command throughout the Weltkrieg. After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the Kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî is the leader and patriarch of the Berzincî clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mehmûd himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mehmûd has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the Kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mistefa Barzanî in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the failure of the Russian socialist revolution that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî, Mistefa was only five when his family was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mistefa first became involved in his brother Ehmedê's milita in the 1920's. Ehmedê's militia attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ehmedê's capture and execution. Mistefa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mistefa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanî tribal laws. Officially Mistefa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."
POLITICS_SHEIKH_SAID_DESC:0 "Follwoing the end of the Ottoman Caliphate during the War in the Sands, many Kurds formerly belonging to the Hamidiye were discharged without pay. Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti-secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."
POLITICS_RIZA_DERSHIMI_DESC:0 "Karuman is a member of what had been a Ottoman loyalist family. The Bedirxans had ruled Bohtan for a century leading up to their independence activities. Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

POLITICS_CHI_SONG_QINGLING_DESC:0 "Song Qingling was the third and final wife of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the founder and ideological center of the Kuomintang party. After the failure of the Northern Expedition, Song decided to stay in China as an outlaw in southern Fujian out of a strong feeling of patriotism. Despite her lack of initial credentials aside from marriage ties, she has proven herself to be an inspirational leader to the Insurgent Zone and has become the head of the pro-democratization Minquan Faction."
POLITICS_CHI_WANG_JINGWEI_DESC:0 "Wang Jingwei is a divisive figure within the KMT that has nevertheless maintained his control over the party leadership for over a decade. His rise to national prominence started shortly before the Xinhai Revolution in 1910 when he failed to assassinate the Qing Regent Zaifeng (Puyi's father), but became a sensationalized revolutionary hero while in captivity.\n\nAfter the Xinhai Revolution, Wang was released and his radical political writings became more famous. Though refusing to sign an oath of personal loyalty to Sun Yat-Sen after his refounding of the KMT, Wang would later become a member and a prominent official in the Guangdong government. Aligning himself with the growing left-radical factions of the KMT and the army’s ‘New Guard’, Wang outmaneuvered Hu Hanmin in 1925 to become Sun Yat-Sen’s successor.\n\nShortly afterwards, the Northern Expedition and the German Intervention shattered the Guangdong Government. Wang and the other radicals were immediately attacked by Sun Fo and other moderates for the failures of the expedition, but his control over party positions and personal alliances prevented his deposition.\nWang survives to this day by these factors, but he is highly aware that his future leadership rests on what happens in the next attempt at revolution.\n\nIn terms of personality, Wang Jingwei is a flamboyant, blustery character who is a natural orator. His penchant for wearing military uniforms when acting in a position as Commander-In-Chief makes many of his opponents see him as megalomaniacal, but he usually lets actual officers take the lead when it comes to military decisions. His insistence at maintaining an alliance with the Syndicalist powers is only surpassed by his desire to avoid another intervention by Germany or Japan at all costs until China is unified and ready to fight them."
POLITICS_CHI_SUN_FO_DESC:0 "The eldest son of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, Sun Fo has been a constant presence within the Kuomintang, though not always a prominent or powerful one. While respected because of his father, Sun Fo is not a charismatic or exceptional person himself. The centrist factions in the KMT that have come to be represented by him rely on his familial name and his 'iron neck' to keep their criticisms of the Minsheng program represented within the party's discourse. With control of the Nationalist Government returned to its moderate factions, Sun Fo is in the unenviable position of both having to reconcile with non-syndicalist powers while scaling back the social aspects of the National Revolution."
POLITICS_CHI_CHEN_DUXIU_DESC:0 "Chen Duxiu is an odd figure in the Kuomintang, as he is both an insider and outside to the party itself. While a member of the KMT, Chen is also the chairman of the Chinese Syndicalist Party, a heretofore minor player even within the syndicalist politics of urban China. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. A prominent intellectual and Xinhai- era revolutionary, Chen's anti-traditionalist bent and background in Marxist theory colors his views of the future development of China."
POLITICS_CHI_HU_ZONGNAN_DESC:0 "Hu Zongnan was one of Chiang Kai-Shek's most trusted protegés and an exemplary young commander during the Northern Expedition. After the German Intervention, Hu's distrust of the dominant civilian factions and close friendship with Dai Chunfeng led him to resent the politically-motivated meddling by the Left KMT's leadership in matters of war. Hu's ties to both the NRA and the ZhongTeJu made him a critical figure in the growth of the bureau and the later success of Dai's coup against the civilian government. Because of his political indispensability and loyalty, Hu was appointed as Acting President for the duration of the \"state of emergency\" that Dai Chunfeng and the ZhongTeJu now govern through. While not an especially charismatic or skilled politican, he and Dai are close friends and his prominence ensures that the army maintains loyalty to the current regime."
POLITICS_CHI_FANG_ZHIMIN_DESC:0 "One of the most prominent politicians and militia commanders of the JiangFu Insurgency Zone, Fang Zhimin was a Jiangxi native and activist that became a close aide of Song Qingling both in civil and military affairs. His aggressive and dogmatic approach to furthering the Nationalist Revolution led him to first become allied with the Minsheng faction, and later the Chinese Syndicalist Party. The previous status of the CSP as a "junior partner" in the Nationalist Revolution makes Chen's unlikely election a strain on the Nationalist Government's previous synonymity with the KMT. Fang is a dogmatic and charismatic leader who acts as an shaky bridge between the growing radical syndicalist movement and the order established by the KMT."
POLITICS_CHI_DAI_CHUNFENG_DESC:0 "The notorious 'Hooded Chairman' of the KMT, Dai Chunfeng rose to power first as a minor protegé of the late Marshal Chiang Kai-Shek, and then through his leadership of the ZhongTeJu. Devoted to a very personal interpretation of the Kuomintang's mission to unify and revive China, Dai and his allies siezed control of the Nationalist government after a long-standing period of instability made it clear that there was no alternative but the KMT's security apparatus taking the helm of state. As shy of the public spotlight as he is ruthless, Dai is very rarely seen in public, but is known to be an indulgent playboy of a kind when off-duty."
POLITICS_CHI_ZHOU_ENLAI_DESC:0 "Despite his unassuming work in the background over the years, Zhou Enlai is an exceptional politician and statesman. Born into a prominent family of clerks, Zhou was educated at westernized schools in both China, France, and Japan. After becoming radicalized by the revolutionary ideals of the early 1920s, Zhou joined the KMT and rapidly rose in its ranks upon merit, eventually becoming its chief foreign minister in the mid 1930s.\nA prominent member of the Minsheng faction, Zhou has also been integral in maintaining good relations between the KMT party and its military wings, especially as the Nationalists continue their reorganization into a proper nation-state."

Facing him was a series malicious accusations by other officers, as well as his own subordinates, who blamed on him for not securing Guangzhou. Li retained his position in the Central Committee as several of his detractors went into exile abroad with their misgivings towards him alive and well. Despite his efforts to aid the leftist cadres and commanders trying to escape to the Commune of France, he was still being isolated and nominally assigned as the Chief of Army Staff in China. Inspired by agrarian movements and supported by Soong Ching-ling and Deng Yanda, he gathered the remnant of his forces, establishing Jiangxi-Fujian guerilla zone.

After the failure of the Northern Expedition however, Deng Yanda decided to cooperate with Wang Ching-wei.

However, he fell into the internal party conflicts which ended up making his views become more right-wing, earning him a reputation as one of the most right-wing officeersin the KMT officer corps.

As a member of the brief Guangdong Provincial Assembly, formed in 1909, Chen quickly made a name for himself as a successful and enthusiastic, albeit radical, reformer, with his republican and anti-Qing leanings being an open secret to local officials.\nWhen the Xinhai Revolution began in 1911, Chen, as a member of the Revolutionary Alliance, became commander of the Guangdong Army and was instrumental in helping Sun Yat-sen of the KMT set up the Constitutional Protection Movement. However, the two men developed a fierce rivalry, having very different opinions on the future of China, which boiled over in 1922 when Chen revolted against Sun. Chen would be forced to surrender and flee after Sun's ships indiscriminately bombarded Guangzhou. The KMT's Central Committee never forgave Chen for his \"betrayal\", ensuring severe tension between the two most prominent republican movements in China.\nChen Jiongming returned to Guangdong after the failure of the Northern Expedition, which he had predicted, and he was quickly asked to become governor of the province once more. Through unprecedented cuts in military spending, Chen was not only able to rebuilt the province, devastated by a decade and a half of conflict, but make it one of the most prosperous despite the German's dubious concessions in the provincial capital.\nAs governor of Guangdong, Chen has been able to put his ideals into practice.

His division would participate in the failed Northern Expedition in 1926, with the Fourth Army decimated by the German intervention force. After a brief exile in Hong Kong, Chen returned to Guangdong, where he would reorganise the KMT remnants in the province under the auspice of Governor Chen Jiongming. With these remnants, he founded his own party, the Productive People's Party (ostensibly little more than a KMT front), participating in the province's burgeoning provincial democracy, supporting a shaky alliance with the Governor despite the latter being widely seen as a traitor by the KMT.\nChen Mingshu would prove to be an able politician, maintaining the KMT's presence in the southern province and ties with Soong Qingling's faction of the Party.

When Guangdong declared its independence in October 1911, Chen was elected the commander-in-chief of its forces, the Xunjun, an army of defected army officers, peasants, and revolutionaries. He would lead this revolutionary army and free Guangdong, forcing the Governor-General to flee Guangzhou before joining up with Sun Yat-sen's forces.

When Sun returned in 1917, Chen would be the one to drive Guangxi forces out of Guangdong in a couple of months when Sun split with Lu Rongting.

In 1925, Chen would return to lead the Guangdong Army against the KMT, but would be defeated and forced into exile. The Kuomintang was then defeated by the Zhili with German help, making Chen's earlier caution rather prophetic as he returned to a Guangdong sapped of its wealth.

Compliance with the Ottoman Caliphate was never fully embraced by the many Sufis in Tripolitania. The Weltkrieg broke the Senussi solidarity, and Ahmed Sharif fell out of favour to his cousin Idris, who was declared Al Mahdi as Senussi during the crisis. Thanks to an army raised by Ottoman General Nuri Killigil, Ahmed Sharif was able to oust Idris and force him into exile in Egypt. Italy's dissolution provided the prextext to invade Fezzan, and thus Ahmed Sharif became the first King of Tripolitania under Ottoman protection. A newfound hostility has found Ahmed adrift from his former allies in Al Ahzar university in Cairo, with his subordinates slowly being replaced by Turkish yes men and foreign trained intellectuals."

His ward Omar instigated the people of Bayda into resistance against the Italians and Sharif. Omar's loyalists left Sharif to tend to the casualties of war, these victims would later remember Sharif's dedication to survival, and elected him leader of the Republic.

Tripoli being the centre for Italian expats, Abu Meniar began reading Il Popolo d'Italia. Mussolinis strive for the unity of Italian people to overcome poverty led Meinar to ingratiate himself with the right people.

POLITICS_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "1926년 자유주의 혁명에서 싸운 소규모 게릴라 지휘관 산디노의 출현은 전혀 예상치 못한 일이었으며, 그가 동의하지 않았던 에스피노 네그로 협정이 서명되기 전까지는 그의 존재는 별로 알려지지 않았습니다. 남부에서 300명의 소규모 게릴라 부대를 시작으로 그는 정글에서 격렬하게 싸웠고 미국 해병대 세력을 서서히 약화시켰습니다. 하지만 그는 프란시스코 세키라 모레노와 함께 군대를 떠나 멕시코로 후퇴할 때까지 계속해서 남쪽으로 밀려났습니다. 멕시코에서 산디노는 사파타와 같은 사회주의 지도자들을 만났고 이는 그의 존재가 국제 사회에 알려지는 계기가 되었습니다. 산디노는 또한 하느님의 밑에서 세계 코뮌의 건설을 믿는 종교단체인 EMECU의 회원이 되었습니다. 1931년 사파타를 대동하고 니카라과로 돌아온 산디노에게 많은 사람들이 그의 동맹으로 나섬에 따라 그의 군대는 그 어느 때보다도 더 커졌으며, 1932년 1월에 산디노와 부하들은 마나과의 해방을 위해 미국 세력을 축출했습니다. 이제 서서히 대중의 인기를 얻으면서, 산디노 대통령은 많은 사람들에게 사랑받고 있고, 몇몇은 심지어 산디노의 통치를 촉진하기 위해 그의 이름으로 각종 단체를 형성하기도 합니다."

POLITICS_ELILIANO_CHAMORRO_VARGAS_DESC:0 "1917년부터 1921년까지 대통령직을 수행한 바르가스는 엄청난 논란으로 가득 찬 평판을 가진 군인입니다. 첫 대통령 임기동안에 미국의 지지를 받은 그는 미국이 니카라과를 관통하는 운하를 건설할 수 있도록 허락해준 조약 협상에 협조적으로 나섰습니다. 바르가스의 첫 임기는 니카라과 국가 부채 상당 부분을 갚아내는 등 대체로 좋은 평가를 얻었습니다. 하지만 이런 노력에도 불구하고 1923년 대통령 선거에서 패배하고 말았습니다. 1926년 카를로스 호세 솔로르사노가 당선되자 쿠데타를 일으킨 바르가스는 산디노의 집권까지 이어지는 여러 역사적 사건의 방아쇠를 당겨버렸습니다. 이로 인해 바르가스는 누군가에게는 혁명의 시작점으로 비춰지는 반면에 누군가에게는 굶주린 권력자라는 비난을 받는 이중적 이미지를 가지게 되었습니다. 하지만 지금 중요한 단 한가지 사실은 그가 가지고 있던 대통령 복귀라는 꿈이 마침내 실현되었다는 것 뿐입니다."
POLITICS_ADOLFO_DIAZ_DESC:0 "아돌포 디아즈는 산디노가 주도한 비방 선전의 주요 목표였으며, 이는 완전히 잘못된 오인공격은 아니었습니다. 1910년 자유주의자 대통령 호세 산토스 젤라야 퇴진에 일조한 디아즈는 미국의 지원을 등에 업고 대통령 자리에 취임했습니다. 1911년부터 1917년 사이에 첫 대통령 임기를 보낸디아즈는 실제로 토노파 광업 회사 등 여러 미국 기업의 진출에 일조하였고 미국의 꼭두각시라는 평판을 얻었습니다. 1914년에는 자유주의자의 반란이 일어났는데, 이 반란을 진압하기 위해 진주한 미국 해병대가 30년이라는 긴 기간 동안 니카라과를 점령했습니다. 해병대는 니카라과에서 수십년간 머무르면서 미국이 니카라과에 운하를 뚫을 수 있도록 허가를 해주었습니다. 하지만 1926년 차마로가 쿠데타를 일으키자 2차 해병대 점령군이 그를 대통령직에서 쫓아냈고, 결국 새로운 대통령 호세 마리아 몬카다에게 대통령직을 물려줄 수 밖에 없었습니다. 그 이후로 디아즈는 줄곧 미국에서 생활했습니다. 지금까지요. 하지만 외세가 다시 한번 니카라과를 점령했으니, 조국을 괴롭히는 반란을 진압하기 위해서 그가 필요한 때가 돌아왔습니다 ."

POLITICS_RAGHIB_DESC:0 "The rival of the Husayni family for decades, Raghib was a student of Istanbul University until the end of the Weltkrieg. Upon returning to Jerusalem, he saw that the Husayni family's aim for an independant Palestine was based on a conflicting promises and antisemitism. Although he himself was Muslim, he believed that the prevailing Palestinian nationalism would be hijacked by a foreign power. Thus, Raghib established his own branch of the Watani party in Jerusalem to counter this movement and the Husayni ambition."
POLITICS_AWNI_DESC:0 "A member of the Al Fatat since before the Great War, Awni assisted in the relief efforts in the Jordan Valley during the Officers Revolt of 1918. While other groups in the Jerusalem Vilyet rallied in the streets, Awni ensured that Yildirim never uncovered the Al Fatat members in Palestine. Now Awni finds himself in control of a vastly unprepared nation that barely knew of his work in the struggle for independence."
POLITICS_MUSA_AL_ALAMI_DESC:0 "Musa Al Alami was the son of the Mayor of Jerusalem, Faidi al-Alami. His upbringing in Jerusalem where Jewish and Muslim converge geve him an appreciation for a government that expedites trade and promotes economic prosperity. The waning power of the Ottomans made his continued allegiance to them impractical to these goals, so in 1926 Musa established Al-tanmiat to prepare cooperation with Zionist groups. Non-aggression agreements were honoured, and subsequent votes propelled Musa into office."
POLITICS_MUFTI_DESC:0 "The son of Jerusalem's mufti and a mortal enemy of the Nashashibi clan, Amin was always quick to deal. The Husayni family's ongoing anti-Zionist position was on the decline until Abraham Antebi was arrested by the Turks. Then sentiment began to turn in Amin's favour. Through deal making in Syria, Amin was able to provide homes for survivors of the 1918 Officers Revolt. The return of Antebi proved to be another boon, as the Yildirim that accompanied Antebi began a campaign to destroy all political dissident in Palestine. Arabs in Palestine flocked to Amin, and he continued to make deals on their behalf all the way into office."
POLITICS_ANTEBI_DESC:0 "Albert Antebi spent the first 40 years of his life trying to mediate the Muslim Jewish divide in the Jerusalem Vilyet. When the Jewish Colonisation Association told him to buy land in Jerusalem for Jewish settlements, he always paid the Arab landowners a fair price. His goal of a peaceful creation of Israel was destroyed when he joined Mustafa Kemal in the Caucasus. After nearly dying in an Istanbul prison, Antebi was released as a bargaining chip of the Yildirm Army Group. He was given the ceremonial title of General Governor of Palestine, the first Jew to be honoured by the Ottomans in centuries, and held in Turkish custody as a virtual prisoner."
POLITICS_HILUPAL_DESC:0 "Radwan became General Secretary of the Palestine Arab Workers Society after the Third Internationale voted for and funded it's reestablishment. Before this, the PAWS was in severe danger of bankruptcy in Jerusalem, as the Yildirim had seized their assets following the return of Antebi. Radwan has suggested to the Internationale that the Yildirim would crumble without Antebi if he were to disappear. This became unnecessary as he died along with the Yildirim Officers in the liberation of the Near East."

He became a teacher in that same university and would return to his educative role many times during his political career. He was named Minster of Justice, Cult and Instruction during President Leguía's first regime, and would become an active member of Peruvian politics until Leguia's coup in 1919. He was chosen as Principal for the San Marcos University, but rejected his position in protest of Leguia's takeover, and began writing three Manifestos, all of them praising the youthful fighting spirit of his students and warning of the danger that entailed having a Caudillo leading Perú. He was exiled in 1925, but would return in 1927, trying to stay away from politics. During Sanchez Cerro's government, he took part in the subsequent constitutional reforms, although he didn't defend some points that the new constitution brought up. Now that he's president of Perú, he'll take a pragmatic approach to the issues Perú faces, trying to compromise with the UR and focusing on investing in better services and education for the nation."
POLITICS_JOSE_DE_LA_RIVA_DESC:0 "Jose de la Riva Agüero y Osma was born in 1885 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. The grandson of the first Peruvian president, José de la Riva Agüero y Sanchez-Boquete, he graduated from the 'Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature, philosophy and law, and managed to get a PhD in jurisprudence in 1911. His first political move was to write an article criticizing Leguía's government in that same year, for which he was arrested, triggering the first ever student protest in the history of Perú, which demanded Agüero's release. Agüero was released, where he became a teacher in San Marcos, but when Leguia took over the government in 1919, Agüero wrote a manifesto defending the constitutional order and left in a self-imposed exile towards Europe.\n\nThat travel to Europe changed him, as he was forced to witness the European recovery from the Weltkrieg, as well as the Syndicalist uprisings. It's in these circumstances that he meets D'Annunzio and Italo Balbo, whose far-right philosophy began influencing the once liberal Agüero. He returns in 1927 to Peru, after Cerro deposed Leguia, and began working as a history professor at the 'Pontificia Universidad Catolica'. He at first saw in Cerro just another dictator, but a meeting he had with the Caudillo changed his mind, as his experience in Europe and relation with thinkers like D'Annunzio and Carlés quickly turned him into a friend and close advisor of Sanchez Cerro. Although the hispanist ideals Agüero had were too extreme for Cerro, he was named head of ministers. With Cerro's death, he became his legal successor in the UR, although Benavides took over the real power upon his death. Now that Agüero is in power, he'll try to take Perú in a radical new direction and return the old glory of the Virreynato back to Perú"

He left to Ecuador in a self-imposed exile after death-threats towards his family from radical UR members, only to return after Benavides gave signs of wanting to restore democracy to Perú, where the contacts he had gained him a place in the Partido Socialdemocrata.

He would later become deputy for the Dos de Mayo province, but would be exiled with his brothers for opposing Leguia's regime.\n\nAfter the assassination of Sanchez Cerro, Benavides, who was a childhood friend of Jorge, recalled him from exile in order to help him in his rule. Jorge began a reform to free political prisoners and recall political exiles that were punished by Sanchez Cerro and Leguia's regimes. However, Ugarteche would be forced to resign due to internal pressure, and Jose de la Riva Agüero would take his place, reinstating the hardline policies against detractors of the regime. Disillusioned with Benavides regime, he formed the Movimiento Democratico with the support of his brothers. Now that Jorge has managed to become President, his belief in the free-market and pro-entente leanings will surely lead to a liberalisation of the Peruvian economy, ushering in a new era of economic prosperity to the nation."
POLITICS_CONSEJO_NACIONAL_DESC:0 "With Agüero's death, the Union Revolucionaria has been thrown into chaos. Factionalism has begun to crack the once unified UR, with many within it vying for power, most notably Luis Alberto Flores Medina, General Ureta Montehermoso and Carlos Miró-Quesada. As long as there's not an elected successor for Agüero, the council will lead Perú forward, albeit with plenty of internal difficulties, until this issue is resolved."
POLITICS_HAYA_TORRE_DESC:0 "Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre was born in the town of Trujillo, La Libertad department, Peru. He signed up for 'Facultad de Letras de la Universidad de Trujillo' when he finished high-school, but would later decide to study to become a Lawyer in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in Lima. There he met Manuel Gonzalez Prada, whose anarchist thoughts influenced the young Raul. He joined several protests against the Leguia regime, which would decide to get rid of him by granting him a scholarship to France. However, this move would backfire on Leguia, as the revolutions in Europe would influence young Raul and his friend, Mariategui, towards Syndicalist ideals.\n\nHe would go to Mexico in 1924, and with other Peruvian syndicalist exiles formed the 'Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana' or 'APRA'. The APRA would focus on pan-Americanism (or as Raul liked to call it, 'Indo-Americanism') and fighting imperialism and the burgois oligarchy that had settled in the continent. He'd return to Perú in 1925, settling in the north of the country with his fellow Apristas. In 1929, Raul led the Trujillo takeover, when APRA forces took over the city and proclaimed a Trujillan commune that would be lead by Raul, and executing the local garrison. When the revolt was crushed, he managed to escape to Chile, where he'd join forces with Churata and González Prada in order to strengthen the APRA for a new revolution in 1931.\n\nNow that Raul Haya de la Torre leads Perú, he'll bring about his dream of a worker's utopia for Perú, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_CHURATA_DESC:0 "Gamaliel Churata, whose real name is Arturo Pablo Peralta Miranda, was born in 1897 in Puno, Perú. Churata formed several culturalist groups in his youth, through which he met Manuel González Prada, Raul Haya de la Torre, and most importantly, José Carlos Mariategui, who would become a close friend of Churata. He was exiled to Bolivia in 1917, but would return to Perú in 1925, joining up Mariategui in Moquegua as the first group of left-wing indigenist thinkers was formed. When Mariategui finally died in 1930 in Chile, Churata was appointed by his friend in his dying wishes as the leader of the 'Frente Tupacamarista'. In his new role as leader, he'd later gather in 1931 with Raul Haya de la Torre and Alfredo González Prada in order to form a United Front from which bring about the Peruvian revolution. Now that Churata leads Perú, he'll focus on restoring the Andinean cultural identity and purge the Spanish-descendant bourgeoisie from the government, bringing about a new culture and society for the now new country of Piruw."
POLITICS_GONZALEA_PRADA_DESC:0 "Julio Alfredo González de Prada y Verneuil was born in 1891 in Paris, France. The son of known Peruvian anarchist Manuel González Prada, he'd graduate from the 'Universidad San Marcos' as a bachelor in literature in 1910, and would later graduate as a bachelor in Jurisprudence, later achieving a PhD on said career. In 1919, Prada would become the intellectual leader of the newly formed 'Frente Armado Obrero', which would fight for better working rights in its most moderate form and for an outright revolution in its more radical members. Seeing the violence this group generated in Lima, Leguia decided to send the military to suppress the movement, ending the first Peruvian Syndicalist experiment. He then decided to retire from public life temporarily, gathering with other anarchists in Peru until the failed Trujillo rebellion forced him to go to Chile. There he joined forces in 1931 with Raúl Haya de la Torre and Gamaliel Churata with the goal of bringing the revolution to Perú. A staunch believer of Anarchism, now that Prada is in power, he will focus on bringing about his father's vision for a descentralized and free Perú."
POLITICS_MIRO_QUESADA_DESC:0 "Carlos Miró-Quesada Laos was born in 1903 in the Peruvian capital, Lima. He graduated as a Lawyer in Lima in 1932 and joined the Union Revolucionaria. His diplomatic ways with other members and professional handling of propaganda for the party made him quickly rise through the ranks, becoming one of the possible successors to Agüero. Now that Miró-Quesada is in power, he's bound to continue the status-quo Agüero created and keep working forward for Agüero's vision of a glorious Hispanic Perú."
POLITICS_FLORES_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto Flores Medina was born in 1899 in the small town of Ayabaca, Perú. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Marcos' in the late 1910's. He staunchly opposed the government of Augusto B. Leguía, for Flores would be imprisoned. He was freed after a decree by Sanchez Cerro, quickly gaining Flores's loyalty, who joined the Union Revolucionaria soon after. He accompanied Sanchez Cerro in his tour through Arequipa, Puno, Cusco and Ica, and would later become deputy for the UR. After the resign of Francisco Lanatta, Flores becomes the president of the council of ministers. During his time as president of the council, the crews of the Peruvian navy ships 'Almirante Grau' and 'Coronel Bolognesi' mutinied with apparent APRA influence. While Flores didn't believe the crews deserved the death penalty, the martial court determined they were traitors and had to die, so he came to the island of San Lorenzo with the prisoners, where he'd lead the execution personally. It is said that Flores himself forced each sailor to dig his own grave before being shot, earning him a reputation for cruelty in the UR.\n\nFlores became a close follower of Agüero, although he considered the latter to be too conservative in his approach against the APRA. Now that Flores is in power, he'll bring about his vision for a corporatist and totalitarian Perú, free from the influence of the decadent APRA which he'll hunt down relentlessly. However, his rejection of all races outside of the Spanish-descendant Criollos is bound to shine through in his policies, and might upset the local native and Asian population..."

He graduated as an artillery second lieutenant from the Escuela Militar de Chorrillos in 1913. After beginning studies in the Escuela Superior de Guerra, he'd be sent to Italy and France to perfect his ability as an artillery officer. A decorated officer, he joined the UR due to his ultra-conservative views and admiration for Agüero, even if they both had their differences. Now that Ureta leads the UR and Perú, he'll try to instill in the Peruvian society at large the patriotism and discipline he was taught as a cadet."

He graduated the Escuela Militar as an infantry second lieutenant, where his grades were so high that he was granted an honorary sword, and named instructor for the school. He continued perfecting his military ability throughout his career, taking an important role in the war against Ecuador, but he never truly prepared to be a politician. As such, now that he's in power, he'll seek to restore the Peruvian democracy, but not before restoring stability to the country and enacting laws to prevent future Caudillismo. However, his rejection of the native population may cause trouble with the large Quechua-speaking minorities in the country...."
POLITICS_BUSTIOS_DESC:0 "Reynaldo Chukiwanka Ayulo Choquehuanca, better known by his regnal name, Pachacutec II, was born in 1914 in Lampa, Puno Province, Perú. The son of Francisco Chukiwanka Ayulo and considered one of the descendants of the Incan emperor, Huayna Capac, he has taken advantage of his father's popularity to rally the Indians to his cause. His father graduated as a lawyer in 1908 from the 'Universidad de Arequipa' and would go to Puno, Perú, where he began fighting for better rights for natives and created an alphabet in which natives could write Aymara, Quechua and Spanish, helping the native population to improve its literacy rates as these languages conflicted with the latin alphabet. Reynaldo became involved in French émigré circles and was influenced by the writings of Charles Maurras. Seeing the government mistreating the native populations, Reynaldo took over his father's institutions and began going from village to village rallying the natives for an insurrection to finally be free of the Criollo oppression."

POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED_DESC:0 "Restored following what has now been deemed the Manchu Coup, Aisin-Gioro Puyi now sits at the helm of a government scrubbed clear of warlord influences. While some observers fear a return to traditionalism, the new Qing government seems to push for a much more modern style of rule. Puyi himself still lacks much power, but this is of his own design. Fearing a tyrannical descendant of the same type that doomed his predecessors, the Emperor and legal scholars have drafted a constitutional structure of monarchy where Puyi exercises spiritual and patriotic power while only having an advisory role in legislature and day-to-day governing. While this new structure of government is untested, it seems strong, and many in China and around the world are hoping Puyi can lead the nation into this brave new world."
POLITICS_PUYI_RESTORED__YIGUANDAO_DESC:0 "While many around China and the world hoped that the so-called Manchu Coup would restore some semblance of constitutional monarchy to China, the scheming machinations of Honored Teacher Zhang Tianran have buried any and all aspirations for modern imperial rule. With religious devotees rapidly filling all governmental posts and seizing control of the military, Puyi has been pushed back into a position of irrelevance, now answering to the beck and call of a religious cult rather than a military clique. His role remains relatively unchanged from the days of Wu Peifu, only now with more obscure religious rituals and less military reviews. Puyi himself seems to not mind very much, having completely fallen under the sway of the teachings of Zhang and the Yiguandao."
POLITICS_WU_PEIFU_DESC:0 "Narrowly escaping death at the hands of Puyi, Pujie, and the other Manchu noblemen who plotted to overthrow the Zhili clique, Wu Peifu has now dropped any facade of Imperial rule over China. Naming himself ‘interim head of the nation’, he is now tasked with building a legitimate system of government for his nation. A military man for his entire life, Wu is not expected to remain in power for long, and transfer control of the country to a hand-picked successor."
POLITICS_HU_SHIH_DESC:0 "A political philosopher and intellectual, Hu Shih may seem like an odd choice for first president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’. Yet the political philosophy he developed, ‘pragmatism’, was deeply influential to Wu Peifu during the years immediately following the restoration of the Qing, and the two frequently met in Hu’s office at Peking University, discussing how both men, former republicans, could and should dedicate themselves to the imperial project as the ‘least bad’ option for China. But with the Manchu’s tyranny revealed, Wu has selected Hu to lead the new government, hoping that the philosopher’s writings and public persona can lend an air of legitimacy to a government seen by most as a sham and a front for the Zhili clique."
POLITICS_WELLINGTON_KOO_DESC:0 "V. K. Wellington Koo, or Gu Weijun as he is known in China, is one of the nation’s foremost diplomats and statesmen. Influential in the negotiations surrounding the end of the Weltkrieg, during the Imperial restoration he served as ambassador to the United States. Recalled due to escalating political tensions, Wu has now appointed him president of the ‘Beijing Government of the Republic of China’, hoping his diplomatic skills can help in achieving international legitimacy and recognition."

QIE_WU_PEIFU_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 22nd, 1874\nPenglai, Shandong, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn in Shandong to a merchant family, Wu entered the Baoding military academy and quickly rose through the ranks of the new Beiyang army. Following the collapse of the Republic of China in 1916 he aligned himself with Feng Guozhang’s Zhili clique, and following Feng’s death in 1919 he rose to dominate the clique, leading it to victory over its main rival, the Fengian clique, in 1928, despite being betrayed by his former ally Feng Yuxiang. During these turbulent years he was mentored by Cao Kun, former and future president of the Assembly, who taught him the intriguing and scheming skills he used to seize control over the government. Although opposed to the reimposition of the Manchu monarchy by Germany, Wu has quickly adapted the Zhili clique to China’s new governmental structure, sidelining the Manchu and ensuring that he and his allies dominated nearly every facet of government. A token opposition was allowed to exist, but Wu truly controls the government.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nWu reportedly owns the world's largest diamond, but has refused to allow anyone to verify this claim.\nWas once renowned for hang a photograph of George Washington behind his desk, but due to the ongoing political turmoil in the United States he has replaced this with a photograph of Bismarck. 'A great political thinker, just like Washington', Wu said to a visiting journalist, ignoring any questions about his relationship with Germany."

He studied in Japan, returning in 1910 for a brief stint in governance before going abroad again, this time to Germany. He served in Yuan Shikai’s government before he declared himself emperor, a decision Jiang strongly opposed. Following the collapse of Yuan’s ‘Empire’, he began working with Wu Peifu, becoming a close confidant and assisting him in defeating the Fengtian clique in 1928. He has become a close ally of Wu, and has spent most of the early 1930’s attempting to prepare the country against the threat of Japanese invasion, something he sees as an inevitability.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nSkilled military theorist, and has written several works on defensive strategy, though several have criticised him of stealing ideas from his subordinates."
QIE_WANG_HUAIQING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1875\nNingjin, Zhili, Qing Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nWhile Wang was born into an upper-middle class family of bureaucrats in 1875, his father’s alcoholism and gambling drove the family into poverty. Wang left his family and joined the military at a young age, helping suppress revolts in 1905 and becoming a confidante of Yuan Shikai. When Shikai’s restoration fell apart, Wang allied himself with the Zhili clique, becoming a close confidante of Cao Kun and Wu Peifu. Though he nominally commands several divisions of troops under the Qing command structure, he essentially uses these armies as thuggish extortionists, demanding outrageous 'protection' fees from towns near his troops garrisons.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nKnown affectionetly as the 'toilet general' by his troops. There are two theories for this unique monicker: The first is that he loves his own toilet so much he orders it to be carried with him on campign at all times, where it served as a makeshift standard. In one story of dubious veracity, he launched an attack on a mountain fortification sitting atop his toilet, stamped with the Chinese character for 'Wang'. His troops faltered once the toilet vanished in the chaos of battle, but Wang and his men lifted the toilet aloft, ralling his troops and (supposedly) inspiring them to climb up a sheer cliff and sieze the bastion. Furthermore, he apparenty even uses a toilet in lieu of an office chair at his desk. The second (and more plausible) explanation for the nickname is that his troops are unwashed and smell like toilets, as Wang believes peasant soldiers taken right from the fields are more honest and loyal."

The younger brother of the Guangxu Emperor, he was acquainted with a baby Puyi while he was a teenager. Rising through the ranks of the Manchu nobility due to his family ties, he was promoted to Inspector General in 1909 before embarking on a tour of the world in 1910, and attended the funeral of King George V in 1911. Appointed head of the Imperial Guard upon his return, Zaitao served until 1912, when Puyi was overthrown. Briefly restored to the position in 1917, he was immediately removed once Zhang Xun’s restoration attempt failed. He finally returned to the post in 1927 with the German re-imposition of Puyi to the throne. One of the founding members of the Manchu Party, Zaitao is more open to reform than most older Manchu nobility, having travelled around the world extensively in his youth. An excellent horsemen, he has become interested in armored warfare in recent years due to its potential battlefield applications.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn his spare time he enjoys horse riding, martial arts, and Beijing-style opera."
QIE_PUJIE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 16th, 1907\nBeijing, Qing Empire \n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe brother of Aisin-Gioro Puyi, Pujie spent his childhood as a playmate to his brother, who was notorious for his temper tantrums and pampered nature. A well-known incident recounted how Puyi threw a tantrum when he saw that the inner lining of one of Pujie's coats was yellow, because yellow was traditionally a colour reserved only for the emperor. Following the Restoration in 1927, Pujie attended university in Berlin, where he was given the nickname 'Peter' by his classmates, as they found Pujie too difficult to pronounce. Despite growing up in the shadow of his brother, Pujie rarely envied the Emperor, who was confined to pointless ceremonial duties and lacked much of an education beyond court formalities. Pujie, on the other hand, was exposed to the latest Western science, education, and culture. Dismayed by the moral laxness he found in Germany that sprung up following the horrors of the Weltkrieg, he returned to China impressed by Western science and industry, but wary of the libertine culture flourishing in Berlin. Furthermore, he was dismayed at the level of German control over the country, and especially despised the Zhili clique, whom he viewed as essentially holding his brother hostage. Largely resigned to a ceremonial position within the military, he plots to one day help his brother return to the rightful position on the throne, with him serving as a ‘guiding hand’, of course.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe has not married, despite rampant suspicion that the Emperor is infertile."

In 1923, he led the troops to surround the president Li Yuanhong at the Tianjin Railway Station. He took the presidential seal to helped Cao Kun become the president. In failing health, Chengbin has largely secluded himself from other Zhili generals, and many are concerned his death will expose deep divisions within the internal workings of the Clique and the Harmony Association.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHe was the founder of Tianjing Clique, which belonged to the early branches of Zhili Clique with Wu Peifu's Luoyang Clique and Cao Kun's Baoding Clique."

Interested in engineering as a child, Runqi entered adolescence as the German intervention in China reached its zenith. One of his most distinctive childhood memories was attending the wedding of his sister Wanrong to the exiled Emperor in the Tianjin concession at the age of 10. After the German intervention placed his brother-in-law back on the throne, Runqi learned German from the horde of businessmen and military attaches that descended on Beijing in the economic boom of the late 1920s and early 1930s. This culminated in him attending the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin, where he picked up the German name ‘Ruprecht’. Returning to China in 1935 following a tour of Europe, Runqi developed a fascination with armored warfare and mechanization, inspired Heinz Guderian, an instructor at the Akademie. He is somewhat more sympathetic to the Germans than other Manchu, but the decadence and moral laxness he observed in Berlin during the boom years of the late 1920s and early 30s prevented him from becoming a full Germanophile.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nIn Berlin he became obsessed wih American cinema, and he introduced the genre to his brother-in-law, the Emperor, also a fan of cinema in general.\nHas quite the media presence, and his dalliances with various Beijing opera singers have made him a favorite of tabloids."

He has worked closely with Jiang Baili in drafting plans to deal with a Japanese invasion, as the only thing he despises more than the Germans is Japanese domination over Manchuria.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nStill maintains contact with many former subordinates in the League.

Instead, he was selected by Zhang Zhidong to join his new Hubei Military Academy. Xiao graduated in 1909, and used connections to Cao Kun’s family to stay adrift in the turmoil of the Xinhai revolution, then using them to become governor of Hubei. He consolidated his rule over the province, and helped organize the ‘Hubei Generals’, an informal group of textile manufacturers, the main industry of Hubei. He narrowly survived an assassination attempt in 1926 carried out by enemies of Cao Kun, and was drawn further and further into the Zhili sphere during and after the German intervention. He still maintains his hold over Hubei, modernizing the province while still working with Beijing.\n§YImportant Notes:§L\nHis connections within the 'Hubei Generals' give him a large amount of clout within Beijing, as Hubei is one of the few provinces that are industrially profitable."

In the 1911 revolution, he did not obey orders to suppress the rebellion, and instead pushed for a constitutional monarchy. After the revolution, he was appointed by Yuan Shikai as Governor of Suiyuan. In 1917, he participated in the activities of Duan Qirui against Zhang Xun. In 1920, he joined the Zhili Clique because he was a relative with Wu Peifu and Feng Yuxiang, and his close personal friendship with Cao Kun.

Du's exact role in the events of 1911 have been heavily disputed, with some claiming he was initially loyal to the Qing, and other accusing him of being a key figure in organizing the Wuchang Uprising. The story as told by Du himself and his Zhili allies has been heavily revised to put him on the right side of history. From 1926 and forward he served as Wu Peifu's handpicked governor of Hubei province, initially struggling to oppose the Kuomintang's invasion of Zhili controlled territory during the Northern Expedition. After the Zhili Clique managed to turn the tide of the war, Du assumed full control of Hubei, managing to stabilizing the war torn province into a loyal stronghold of Zhili influence.

Here, he became acquainted with many future Zhili Clique generals. Quickly promoted through the ranks, Wu stayed largely isolated from many of the political turmoils that ensnared fellow naval officers, and has a reputation of being somewhat ‘apolitical’ - or the closest to apolitical one can get in this period in Chinese history.

Leading the naval reforms after the peace treaty was signed, Sa was largely oblivious to the larger political maelstrom brewing in China. During the Wuchang uprising he faced a full-scale mutiny, and retired to Shanghai rather than either fire on his own men, or betray his country. He briefly served as Acting Premier in 1920, before taking the largely ceremonial position of the Governor of Fujian in 1922, where he essentially planned to retire. Here, he became acquainted with the Zhili clique and began to advise Wu and other, junior members of the Navy on modernizing the aging fleet.

Two years later, Zaixun succeeded Zaiyi as a beile of the Prince Rui peerage. In 1908, he was made an acting junwang (Prince of the Second Rank) but remained nominally a beile. In 1909, Zaixun was appointed as an acting Navy Minister in the Imperial Cabinet headed by Prince Qing. Later, he was sent to Europe and the United States to study the navies of the Western powers. After returning to China, in 1911, he became a full Navy Minister. Following Puyi's autocoup, he has come out of retirement to serve again as Navy minister. Despite never holding a battle command in his life he has been granted an admiralship. It is yet to be seen if he can competently command a warship in battle."

Only 17 during Puyi's restoration, the corruption and scandal that plagued the new empire greatly dismayed the impressionable young man, and on the suggestion of a friend he attended clandestine meetings of the Young China Party. From those meetings he attended the Baoding military academy, where he quickly stood out as both politically and militarily shrewd. Along with Fang Zhejian he assembled a group of young cadets dedicated to reforming the Empire. Interestingly, Ling was not a rabid anti-monarchist, and quickly appreciated how Wu Peifu and the Zhili had manipulated Puyi to serve as a legitimizing symbol of the regime."

Cobbling together a small sum of money, they sent the young boy to the local provincial secondary school. Unfortunately for Fang, warlord soldiers arrived in the provincial capital and burned the school, nearly killing Fang. The young man was left with a scar running down his leg and a burning hatred for warlords and the chaos they inflicted on the poor of China. After taking the entrance exams to Baoding Military Academy, he joined the Young China Party branch at the campus, though his sympathies lay more with the NCERA. He led one of the squads that arrested and executed senior Zhili leadership during the coup, and the command experience he picked up there made him stand out so much to Li Bingzhi that he promoted the young man on the spot."

POLITICS_MLACERDA_SPO_DESC:0 "Hailing from inner Minas Gerais and born in 1887, Maria Lacerda de Moura was raised by her anticlerical, spiritist parents in the somewhat larger paulista town of Barbacena, and began her political and social history shortly after becoming a full time teacher, campaigning for nationwide education reform and literacy efforts. She was publishing books as early as 1918 and started to author articles 8 years before that, and during this period that she began to be influenced by anarchist and syndicalist thought. Despite issues with suffragette movements, whom she saw as 'not fighting for enough change', she has always been one of the foremost feminist activists in the country, something that no doubt influenced in her choice as Chairwoman by progressive minded delegates, but she also has held a position among the most respected lefitist academics and authours on São Paulo. Now, São Paulo's first head of state has the daunting task of leading the continuing socialization of the government, rising demands of officers and the ever contentious Congress of Trade Unions, as some still rose issues regarding her birthplace, but her experience and fame seem to indicate she is more than prepared for the task; or so the nation hopes."
POLITICS_ISIDORO_DIAS_SPO_DESC:0 "One of, if not the most, respected military officer in all of former Brazil, Isidoro Dias Lopes has always been held in high regard in his adoptive home of São Paulo. While his task as President is a thankless one, he is one of the very few men to be respected all across the political spectrum, and thus has the gravitas necessary to ensure that São Paulo's transition into a sovereign state goes as smoothly as possible. However, time stops for no man, and a cloud of uncertainty looms overhead, as the power vacuum Isidoro will leave behind when he dies will certainly have colossal consequence for the young republic and its people's hopes."
POLITICS_JANIO_QUADROS_SPO_DESC:0 "Born in Mato Grosso do Sul in 1917, Jânio da Silva Quadros is one of the leading members of the new generation of Social Democrats that grew up and lived through the worst of the Black Monday crisis and its damaging fallout. The volatile years that followed allowed for the relatively young law school teacher to firmly establish himself in the political scene in São Paulo, decrying the corruption and inefficiency that has always plagued the state's government even before independence. His populist, aggressive campaign, that didn't even spare members of his own party, resonated with the people, who gleefully sang along to his slogans of ''Brooming'' the Paulista politics of the old, decrepit elites of Brazil. Despite all his ambitious plans, he still a democrat and constrained by constitutionale limits, but that has not stopped his enemies accusing him of Syndicalism and treason alike."
POLITICS_MANUEL_TOLEDO_SPO_DESC:0 "Perhaps the oldest political actor of great relevance in the nation, Pedro Manuel de Toledo has a long and rich political career that began almost concurrently with the rise of the republic itself. A staunch defender of liberty and the republic, he was involved in numerous revolts and conspiracies against the status quo, and wrote extensively on matters from secret voting to state autonomy. Of these revolts, his role in the large scale uprising in São Paulo is of great importance, as he saw the federal meddling as a direct attack on republican principles; he does not make great effort to hide his satisfaction on São Paulo having finally ''gotten rid of the dead weight pulling it down'', as he comptemptly calls the other former Brazilian states. Having somewhat recently ended a term as president of São Paulo, Toledo decided he was ready to become president of a sovereign, independent state now, even while well into his eighties. His age is seen as his main obstacle by the people, but politics is rarely that simple, and his presidential victory did not grant his party full control of the lower house, which might very well be an issue unless he is willing to work with some of the more virulent opposition politicians. A lawyer but chiefly diplomat by trade, he personally opposes any kind of foreign military adventures by São Paulo, but intends to respect all existing treaties regardless."
POLITICS_CARDOSO_MELO_SPO_DESC:0 "A paulista born in 1883, José Joaquim Cardoso de Melo Neto has always been an accomplished law and policy-maker. His terms as teacher of law were left behind when he joined politics more intensely after the revolt against Rio in his state in 1927, but he was active in a minor scale for a full decade prior in minor legislatures and activities. Having since been a staple figure in the Brazilian parliament, he has found himself now as President of São Paulo, albeit not in the way he expected this to pass; for São Paulo is now an independent state, instead of being primus inter pares of Brazil. As he has to juggle the ever scheming paulista elites and the demands of foreign nations, his task may seem daunting at first, but popular support for the new republic and the plans to modernize the nation have granted him plenty of political capital to deal with domestically."
POLITICS_JULIO_PRESTES_SPO_DESC:0 "A representative of a powerful and traditional family in São Paulo, Juilio Prestes debuted in the political arena in 1909 as a state representative in the parliament of São Paulo. He quickly distinguished himself, and even led troops into battle against mutinous military men twice before becoming a federal representative, where his liberal character gave him admiration from many. A friend and supporter of Washington Luís, Prestes was devastated by his sudden assatination and rallied behind the cause during the coming crisis and conflict, but was glad that it ended as quickly as it did. He gained renewed political vigour afterwards, and claims to be trying his best to uphold the legacy of his friend Washington, even if his dream of a united Brazil seems now forever condemned. Following the defeat of Brazil's military and the establishment of the Republic of São Paulo, Julio found himself as the clear frontrunner to become the first president, and his victory in these snap elections again renewed his vigour to uphold the liberal and positivist principles he defended throughout his life, despite claims of fraud and foreign interference by some of his opposition."
POLITICS_BERTOLDO_HOS_SPO_DESC:0 "Bertoldo Ritter Klinger, like many officers currently living in São Paulo, was born in the then Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, and garrisoned several locations across that country, including Rio. His actions and service during the Interstate War are quite noteworthy, as is his is exemplary record of always standing up for what he believed was the right thing, as his career was often set back by his participation in a variety of mutinies with an even greater variety of motivations, from opposing mandatory vaccination to better conditions in the barracks for infantrymen. His position at the forefront of such popular causes, and his staunch replublican beliefs, have been decisive factors on making the officer the first president of the Republic of São Paulo, where he is seen a stabilizing factor amidst the constant bickering of the nation's oligarchs and powerful families."
POLITICS_SALGADO_HOS_SPO_DESC:0 "Júlio Marcondes César Salgado was born in Pindamonhangaba. São Paulo, to family with a long tradition in military duty and Paulista politics, he himself a relative of Inácio de Siqueira Salgado, the baron of Itapeva. He has a long service record, started at age 16, and has fought both in the Interstate War and against the ever frequent Syndicalist and Tenentist uprisings in his state, and his veterancy has put him in a condition of being the commander-in-chief and nominal head of state of the newly declared Republic of São Paulo, at least until 'order is properly restored', but few doubt his tenure will hardly be a short one. Having led his state's forces in battle against the rest of Brazil before, Julio isn't exactly phased by the rapid changes brought by the break up of Brazil, and sees São Paulo's freedom as a positive happening for its people. However, unrest is not yet over in the state, and few can predict what foes the new republic might face abroad in such dangerous times."
POLITICS_LOBATAO_DA_MASSA_DESC:0 "A native of Taubaté, José Bento Renato Monteiro Lobato is among São Paulo's foremost intellectuals and authors, and has always had a penchant for getting his nose into politics since a young age. While he is known by most younger Paulistas as the author of beloved children's books and his escapades while campaigning for nationalization of the Brazilian oil sector, the political class knows his radical and often erratic rhetoric dates back many years before he was thrust into power. A member of the São Paulo Eugenics Society, he has always advocated for harsh measures to maintain what he views as a pure society, and has even written books with highly prejudiced concepts behind them, and now openly praises the activities of the KKK, something he had previously done in private. His economic stances are no less extreme, defending radical nationalization and industrialization programs; he has for decades argued against foreigners getting access to his nation's wealth. His belief in a harsh, 'dog eat dog' view of diplomatic affairs also is his north when dealing with other nations ,especially his so called 'benefactors', whom he sees as a necessary ally to rid São Paulo of its 'worst elements' through an intense immigration incentive program. Said abrasive rhetoric has certainly not fallen in deaf ears, but has also led to an escalation of social and racial violence across São Paulo, but it remains to be seen if this dog is all bark, or if Lobato's bite will truly leave its mark."

This rivalry began when the young Ibn Saud was ejected from his tent in Riyadh by the Rashids. Never a pawn of Emirs, ibn Saud's father rallied the destitute men of the coastal Emirates to the great goal of his dynasty, Wahhabism. The Rashids were then ejected at the cost of many men, including their only western ally.

Following the assault on Zhang Xun in Beiping, Song deserted Yuan to join the KMT, and threw in his loyal divisions under their government. In 1925, Song requested Chiang governorship of Shandong should the province be claimed. The subsequent Northern Expedition fell apart for Song in 1929, and he held Linyi in Shandong against Zhang Zongchang. Any hope of reinforcements were dashed by 1930, depriving Song of legitimacy. A solution to this crisis in confidence came when Song heard the Duke Yansheng was in mortal danger. Living in the Mount Tai Miao, the descendant of Confuicius was threatened by the newly-arrived Yiguandao, which desputed his orthodox religion.

POLITICS_ZHANG_TIANRAN_DESC:0 "Tianran aspired to nothing in his life until he was introduced into the cult of Lu Zhongyi. Lu Zhongyi was the leader of a small group of religious syncretists called the Yiguandao in 1918. Lu Zhongyi had always planned for his sister Lu Zhongjie to succeed him to lead the Yiguandao, and had even recognized her supposed divinity as the reincarnation of the Buddhist God Guan Yin. A theological schism occured after the passing of Lu Zhongyi in 1930, wherein Lu Zhongjie took followers loyal to her out of the Yiguandao and relocated to Henan, where they remain to this day. Tianran, having the full trust of his members as well as a newly divined wife Sun Suzhen, began to tell startling revelations. In 1922, Tianran had built a shrine on Mount Tai, which grew until it encompassed the other monasteries on the mountain. By 1924 Mount Tai had become the year-round home for Zhang Tianran and his inner circle. A spirit writing session that same year foretold Emperor Puyi was in danger of being poisoned, and a trip to Beijing was planned. Tianran amused and flattered Emperor Puyi with promises that the Yiguandao would reinforce loyalty to the Qing through charity and warfare if need be. The first Red Spears and Big Swords arrived to Mount Tai in 1925. The greatest catch was Tianran’s supposed conversion of Zhang Zongchang in 1935."

Arriving in Shanghai to pledge allegiance to the Republic, he fell in with Feng Guozhang and joined the Zhili Clique when they emerged in 1917. When the Fengtian and Zhili Clique turned on each other in 1920, Zongchang was withdrawing his forces from across Northern China back into Shandong. This allowed Zongchang to commit most of his forces to the Fengtian Clique when Zhang Zhoulin made peace with Sun Yat Sen in 1926. Zongchang ordered his army again to retreat into Shandong when the Fengtian Clique needed him most. This retreat made Shandong into his prison as well as refuge, where he was an illegal but tolerated occupying force under the shadow of the Qing. An ability to utilize railroads effectively as well as the unusual charisma of a man referred to as “filthy” by even his allies carried him through to victory. As medicine was out of his reach financially, a bout of sickness drew him up the 6,600 steps to a Yiguandao doctor. Zongchang eventually met the Yiguandao’s Honored Teacher, Zhang Tianran. Whether it was his sickness or the lack of anything else to do up on Mount Tai, Zongchang promised Tianran that he would follow the esoteric lifestyle espoused by the cult for his health."

Li's first major decoration was in fighting the Wuchang Uprising of 1911. An association with Anhui general Qu Tongfeng guided Li towards clique politics during the republican years. Like Qu Tongfeng, who was cast out of the Anhui Clique for corruption, Li was set adrift and found his way into the Fengtian clique in 1924. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin reassigned Li that year to Zhang Zongchang, who was fighting in Zhili. Li was initially impressed with Zhang Zongchang's ability in spite of his lack of manners, but this appreaisal turned sour by 1928, when Zongchang became entrenched in Shandong. Li, despite his history of corruption, could not properly pay his division on taxes collected honestly in Shandong. Li, having taken inspiration from the decleration of Xue Dian as the Yiguandao's minor Emperor in Shandong, decided to present himself as spiritually enlightened. Li publicly began training in Wudang swordsmanship, and named himself 'the Magic Sword' to provide an air of mystery.

This betrayal led Feng Anbang into the Anhui Clique, and served as an infantry commander for them until 1924. This relationship ended when Feng Anbang was accused of taking bribes, leading to a forced retirement to Shandong. Feng's experience commanding infantry was not forgotten, and he was hired by the incoming Zhang Zongchang to train his army in 1931. In exchange, Zongchang forwarded a pardon for Feng's crimes from Zhang Zuolin, which enables Feng to move freely once more.

The guilt of losing to the westenrers drove the disgraced Zhang into the army of Yuan Shikai, whose ambitious goal of becoming an Emperor felt like more of a natural evolution for Zhang than republicanism. After Yuan died, Zhang fell in with the Anhui clique, and briefly served under Zhang Shuyuan as an administrator in Shandong in 1918. Zhang eventually failed his leader again after his regiment fell fighting in Hunan. This left Zhang Huaizhi destitute again, and the only people who would take him was the Yiguandao.

After living half of his life abroad in the west, Antoun returned to his homeland in 1925 to find the dream of democratic Lebanon dead. In Lebanons's rubble, Antoun founded an organisation called Natural Syria, dedicated to a non-sectarian independent Syria that could stand against Ottoman and Western Imperialism. Sharing only a distaste for imperialism, Antoun rejected the message of the syndicalists as divisive and rejected the Ba'ath ideals. Antoun sees Natural Syria as the homeland of ally Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis and Lebanese regardless of race. In his writing, Antoun claims that he will merge the best parts of socialism, nationalism, and patriotism under the Zawbaa."
POLITICS_FAWZI_QUWU_DESC:0 "Captain of the 12th Ottoman corps of Mosul, Fawzi had proven his bravery to the Turks. Where many heard the call of Faisal's Arab Revolt, Fawzi heard only the commendations from General Otto von Kreiss. When the Turks were victorious, they made Fawzi a Pasha. Although showered with praise, Fawzi refused to call himself a Pasha. His current role as military governor is unique among the vilayets as he exerts considerable control over the soldiers in his command."
POLITICS_ADIB_BIN_HASSAN_SYR_DESC:0 "Sami Al Hinawi has spent his career avoiding the easy paths to power. Never renouncing his Arab name in the Ottoman Military, his loyalty earned him the right to use his birth name. The allure of the Arab Revolt never reached him in during his time in the Jerusalem Vilyet. A possible alliance between his officers and the emerging SSNP was rejected on the same basis that the easy way to power is a trap. Time will tell whether this stalwart commitment will pay off."
POLITICS_SHUKRI_QUWATILI_DESC:0 "Among the several branches of Al Fatat in the Arab world, none would be as successful as Syria's. This is due to the careful manoeuvring of their leader, Shukri al-Quwatli. Despite his exile from Syria twice, he has again returned and collects his allies in preparation for a new type of Republican government. Shukri's position in Syria is an intermediary between the liberal burghers and conservative landowners that hold judicial power in Syria."
POLITICS_SULTAN_ATRASH_DESC:0 "Sultan Atrash is relied upon by the Syrian people not because he is a great unifier. Atrash openly admits that he seeks autonomy for his Druze people against the wishes of his own allies. This push for autonomy of Syria's minority groups is however unilateral. Atrash wishes to rebuke pan arabism and protect Syria as a nation of minorities."
POLITICS_NAZIK_AL_ABID_DESC:0 "Once exiled to Cairo in the wake of a Turkish crackdown, Nazik al Abid has pulled off an incredible achievement other Arab feminists like Tarab Abdul Hadi could only dream of; for she was elected head of state of Syria. Her work establishing the International Red Crescent and her liberal position towards veils has finally paid in dividends for her and for women across Syria, as her notoriety has put her in a prime position to lobby for their rights in the country."
POLITICS_SABRI_ASALI_DESC:0 "Sabri al-Asali began as an Arab member of the Ottoman Parliament in the capital. Where many of this contemporaries joined secret societies and stocked weapons, Al Asali knew that legislation would lead to Syria's freedom. When the pen signed Syria's independence, he was in Cairo in Hal'il meeting with heads of state. It is through the outside in that Sabri al-Asali assumed power in Syria. He may be out of touch with the common Syrian, but his commitment to economic ties with the Arab world set Sabri apart from his peers."
POLITICS_MICHEAL_AFLAQ_DESC:0 "Michel Aflaq was in Paris during the Syndicalist revolution. Swept up in the socialist organisations, he joined the Commune's government as an informal student. There he studied trade unionism with Saladin al Bitar, and they both decided that Syria was ready for revolution in 1925. The revolution to be, a renaissance or Ba'ath, never materialised. Michel was unable to form trade unions in Damascus or Mosul, so he returned to Paris in 1930 abandoning the Ba'ath party. His return as of late as an emancipator and the forced creation of a trade union council in Damascus means his power is backed up by his superiors in the Internationale more than it is backed by Syrian supporters. This will not stop Aflaq from realizing the dream of Ba'ath however, a united Syrian proletariat."
POLITICS_SYNDIE_JBS_DESC:0 "A Sheikh is not the first person the International expected when they asked Syria to elect their first leader among the syndicates. While it is true that Muhammad al-Ashmar's first station was a Mufti, he is now a leader of the people. His influence within the mosques in reinterpreting Islamic law and rejecting Secular syndicalism in favour of voluntary Zakat from all sets him apart from any other branch of socialism in Syria."

POLITICS_NICHOLAS_ROERICH_DESC:0 "Raised by the aristocratic Roerich family of St. Petersberg, Nicholas has expressed interest in both the aesthetic and spiritual side of socialist revolution. This interest led Nicholas first into the Arts, where he graduated from St. Petersberg University and the Imperial Academy of the Arts in 1897. Nicholas became immersed in Russian avant garde art, which included working with the legendary Igor Stravinsky and Vaslav Nijinsky. The October Revolution ended the social peace that Nicholas had known, and set Nicholas closer to social conservatism and orientalism in opposition to Vladimir Lenin.\nNicholas Roerich fled to the United States and joined the Theosophical Society, a spiritual movement that shared Roerich's admiration of undeveloped nations as 'more spiritually pure' than westernized counterparts. Roerich visited the Theosophical Society in both the Bhaatiya Commune and British Dominion in 1930, and had a startling conversation with Gandhi. Gandhi expressed to Roerich that Vladimir Lenin was not against traditional culture, but against corrupt leaders of traditional institutions.\nNicholas Roerich decided to take his family to visit Tibet through the Shimla mountains, and received a second calling in the mountains. A sherpa guiding Roerich remarked 'Is it true, that Lenin was not against Buddhism?' This led to a religious experince in Nicholas, which ended the expedition when he spoke of this in Lhasa. Nicholas began describing Vladimir Lenin as 'Mahatma Lenin' and was forced to leave Tibet by the Ganden Phodrang for this heretical idea. Back in Bharatiya, Nicholas was alerted to a possible revolution in Tibet eminating from Sikkim. In Sikkim, Nicholas Roerich combined his revelations with an endorsement from Gandhi to form the Sacred Union Party, a revolutionary party dedicated to saving Tibetan Buddhism through esoteric leninism."
POLITICS_9TH_PACHEN_LAMA_DESC:0 "The 6th Panchen Lama was born Choekyi Nyima into the Thuben class in Shigatse, Tibet. Raised and educated by the prestigious Tashi Lhunpo Monastery, the young Choekyi Nyima was predestined to be the 'Great Scholar' under the Dalai Lama, and was for a time well respected by the Ganden Phodrang. As a young scholar, the 6th Panchen Lama met with radical lama Agvan Dorzhiev, who taught him the Prayer to Shambhala. This prayer was intended to collect the allies of Buddhism together to the center of the world, the fictional city of Shambhala. Political realities came in 1924 when the 13th Dalai Lama was modernizing his army. The Dalai Lama demanded more taxation from the Panchen Lama as part of his feudal duties. When the Panchen Lama refused, The Dalai Lama cut off the Tashi Lhunpo Monastery and confiscated the Panchen Lama's property. The resulting conflict forced the Panchen Lama to flee Tibet to Mongolia in 1924.\nThe Panchen Lama, seeing Mongolia as unable to aid in his return under Baron Ungern, left for Bharatiya in 1931. In Bharatiya, the Panchen Lama connected with the other exiled Tibetan nobles Pandatsang Rapga and Thubten Kunphela. These two exiles had connection in Kham, and had aligned themselves with exiled KMT generals to form the Tibet Improvement Party. The Panchen Lama, seeing no othr way to return to Tibet save for an invasion, joined the Tibet Improvement Party and began publishing commentaries of Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles of the People. The storm of the revolution saw the Panchen Lama promise to preserve the existence of the Ganden Phodrang while removing their ability to choose the Kashag."
POLITICS_TSIPON_LUNGSHAR_DESC:0 "Tsipön Lungshar comes from a family that has served the Dalai Lama since the 18th century, and has deep connections to Lhasa. Lungshar was choosen to supervise the elite education of four nobles called the 'Rugby Four' in the UK prior to the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Lungshar stood in between the more radical nobles like Thuben Kunphela and Trimön in the early years of the Regency. It was Lungshar who accused Thuben Kunphela of orchestrating a foreign infiltration of Tibet in 1933, leading to his exile. However, Lungshar also opposed the power of the Regency, especially their strongman Trimön. Trimön orchestrated a trial where Lungshar was accused of being a socialist, then blinded before being exiled to Sikkim. The revolution saved Lungshar's life, and enabled him to return to Tibet and found the Kyicho Kuntun, a moderate political party that wishes to balance the needs of democracy with the traditions of Tibet."
POLITICS_TSARONG_DZASA_DESC:0 "When the 13th Dalai Lama decided to modernize the army in 1923, he put nobleman Tsarong Dzasa in charge of the newly created Dmag-Sgar. Tsarong previously had a very successful career leading the Dob Dobs in defending Tibet from the Qing during the Xinhai revolution. Defeating the Qing earned Tsarong the name 'Hero of Chaksam', and he used his popularity to increase the national budget for Tibet's army. This indirectly caused the expulsion of the Panchen Lama in 1924. The death of the 13th Dalai Lama left the country in the control of the Regency, led by the 5th Reting Rinpoche and Trimön. Tsarong was demoted from Commander-In-Chief to Civil Engineer and Treasurer, but this failed to stop his popularity. Trimön was initially happy when Tsarong left for Utsang, along with his Young Tibet movment, but now Trimön sits in the Potala prison while Tsarong has effectively assumed his position.

The Reting Rinpoche stood behind Trimön's continuation of the tax increases, and stands as the most legitimate leader of Tibet until the 14th Dalai Lama is found.

Trimön returned to Tibet to become the Comissioner of Eastern Tibet, where he irritated the Kashag with his staunch isolationist stance. In the final year of the 13th Dalai Lama, Trimön happend upon the macinations of Lungshar, and personally persuaded the aging Dalai Lama to order Lungshar blinded for his liberal schemes. Trimön used this political affair to become a close confident with the regent, the young Jamphel Yeshe Gyaltsen. Trimön influenced the young Regnet towards his isolationist view of both China and India, and the new Reting Rinpoche reciprocated by appointing Trimön Commander-In-Chief of the Tibetan Army.

This status made him able to arrange for advanced gunnery training in the British Raj, as well as lessons in English and Hindu. Dingja was appointed General in 1923, and was demoted in 1925 due to his liberal viewpoints. Following the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Dingja attempted to organize the pruchase of weapons from the Britihs Raj, but was denied by the new Commander-In-Chief, Trimön. To ensure that Dingja did not upset Lhasa further, Trimön assigned Dingja in 1935 to lead the Dob-Dobs of Shigatse, ostentibly to protect them from a possible return of the Panchen Lama."

POLITICS_SHUMYATSKY_DESC:0 "보리스 슈마츠키의 부모는 자신의 고향을 떠나지 않았다는 이유로 시베리아로 강제 유배당하게 됩니다. 이 사실은 슈마츠키의 뇌리에 생생히 남아 있으며, 그에게 항상 페트로그라드 차르 정권의 부패를 상기시킵니다. 볼셰비키에 가담했던 슈마츠키는 러시아 내전이 끝남과 동시에 러시아를 떠날 수밖에 없었고, 이제 트란스아무르 내에서 영향력 있는 정치인이 되었습니다. 자신의 사상이 우경화 되고 있다는 지적에도 불구하고 슈마츠키는 트란스아무르를 복지국가로 탈바꿈시킨다는 목표를 계속 추구하고 있습니다. 볼셰비키 선동가로 활동했던 경험은 그가 대통령 선거 동안 과반이 넘는 표를 얻게 만들어주었습니다."
POLITICS_MERKULOV_DESC:0 "친일 임시 연해주 정부의 전 지도자였던 메르쿨로프의 내각은 세묘노프의 트란스바이칼 국가에 통합되었습니다. 이제 콜차크가 더이상 앞을 가로막지 않고 블라디보스톡에 민주주의가 복원되면서, 보잘것없는 농민의 아들 메르쿨로프는 트란사무르를 번영으로 이끌기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. 시민들과의 광범위하고 개인적인 접촉은 대선에서 그가 과반수의 표를 얻는데 도움을 주었습니다."
POLITICS_WOJ_DESC:0 "체코슬로바키아 군단의 지도자이자 러시아 내전의 영웅인 보이치에호프스키는 브레스트-리토프스크 조약을 받아들이기를 거부했습니다. 화가 난 그는 러시아 공화국 정부와의 모든 접촉을 끊고 그의 지지자들을 찾아 트란스아무르로 떠났습니다. 콜차크 제독의 오른팔이었던 세르게이는 자신의 '친구'를 배반하고 살해했습니다. 악당 제독보다 덜 공격적이고 야심이 강하며, 숙련된 베테랑인 보이치에호프스키는 서쪽으로 진격할 준비가 되었습니다."

POLITICS_DUKE_GIUSEPPE_DESC:0 "Archduke Joseph Ferdinand of Austria has waited a long time to sit in the throne he was promised in the Treaty of Rome. An accomplished commander and a hero of the Weltkrieg in Austria, he was still unable to coordinate a defence against the rising republican and later syndicalist threat in he uneven terrain of Tuscany, and later retreated to Lazio to avoid being encircled. He never really saw the title of Grand Duke as much more than a promise for many years, but his long army career will probably have an impact in his reign. A pompous and proud man, he is eager to learn about the lands he now considers his, even if his sometimes obvious questions regarding landmarks make him almost feel like a noble a tourist rather than a Duke. Thankfully for him, a goverment of local officers and politicians oversee most of the boring bureocracy."

POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last twenty years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a member of the Italian Federation and now sovereign nation. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after six years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many others work to maintain, the matters of the constant syndicalist threat and the lack of a male heir of his body, weigh heavily on him. The nascent feelings of powerlessness, even in his current position as a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

POLITICS_ADOLF_FRIEDRICH_DESC:0 "Once could hardly find a place in the world which Adolf Friedrich, the first and only Duke of the United Baltic Duchy, has not seen. An erudite, veteran of the Prussian Cuirassiers, a passionate hunter and an avid car racer, he's undertaken personal pilgrimages to the Middle East, East Asia and Africa, travelling thousands of kilometers on foot and horseback, throughout most of his life. Africa and its lush wildlife hold a special place in his heart, however - he's crossed Africa from east to west, left his name upon a volcano in Tanganyika, and ultimately landed a job as the Governor of Togoland before the Weltkrieg. While definitely not a soft administrator, Adolf Friedrich displayed great interest in the lives and culture of the Togolese natives, even taking the time to learn the Ewe language. \n\nAt the end of the Weltkrieg, his experience as a colonial governor and great prestige among the German upper class led to Adolf von Pilchau's Regency Council offering the throne of the United Baltic Duchy to him. Adolf Friedrich agreed and arrived to Riga in spring of 1919, where he announced that he shall safeguard the ancient rights and privileges of the Baltic nobility and do everything in his power to be a good ruler. For the most part, Duke Adolf Friedrich is a passive monarch who dedicates his institution to patronage of the arts, sciences, and sports. He's been recognized as the best racecar driver in the entire Duchy, surpassing all of his fellow fans of the sport. Years of experience have given him plenty of political acumen, however, and, recognizing the weakness of his new realm, he's begun to speak out more often, expressing the need for reform."

POLITICS_JOHN_NANCE_GARNER_DESC:0 "친구들에 의해 '선인장 잭'으로 알려진 존 낸스 가너 4세는 텍사스 출신의 변호사이며 하원 의원으로 오랫동안 지냈던 미국의 새 대통령입니다. 그는 민주당 지지자이며, 약간 보수적인 정치인입니다. 그리고 가장 중요한 것은 그가 민주주의의 열렬한 지지자라는 것입니다. 이 텍사스 출신 판사는 좌파나 우파와 타협할 이유는 없다고 생각합니다."
POLITICS_HERBERT_HOOVER_DESC:0 "전 미국 상무부 장관이자 현재 미국의 대통령인 허버트 후버는 미국 역사상 가장 미움받는 사람 중 한 사람으로서 그 자리를 굳혔습니다. 첫 임기 동안 대공황을 더 심각하게 만들기만 했던 것에도 불구하고, 1932년 하원을 통해 재선된 것은 광범위한 분노를 불러일으켰습니다. 대통령에게 있어서 슬픈 현실입니다. - 경제를 회복시키려는 그의 모든 시도는 실패했고, 상황을 진정시키려는 노력은 상황을 더 악화시킬 뿐이며, 그의 당마저 그를 외면하고 있습니다."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MACARTHUR_DESC:0 "외국 정부들과 자신의 국민들에게 미움받는, 미합중국의 첫 번째 독재자인 총사령관 맥아더는 약하지 않습니다. 급진주의 국가들을 제거하기 위해 미국 지배층의 부름을 받아서 온 이 장군은 국가를 자신의 연대를 지휘하듯이 다스립니다 - 질서와 엄격한 규율 그리고 그에게 반대하는 모두에 대한 강력한 처벌을 통해서 말입니다. 그는 자신이 진정으로 미합중국을 구하기 위해 이곳에 왔다고 믿고 있지만, 건국의 아버지들은 그의 행동을 지지할까요?"
POLITICS_HUEY_LONG_DESC:0 "루이지애나 주지사인 휴이 롱이 정확히 어떤 사람인지 말하기는 어렵습니다. 일부 사람들은 그의 '재산 공유' 계획이 새로운 옷을 입은 생디칼리슴이라고 말하는 반면, 다른 이들은 그의 비민주적, 족벌주의적 정치 방식과 경쟁자를 제거하기 위해 준군사단체 '미닛맨'을 이용하는 것이 그의 국민대중주의적 자세의 신호라고 지적합니다. 어찌됐건, 롱 대통령은 서민들의 사랑을 받고 있으며, 때로는 오만하게 보일 수도 있지만 그의 카리스마는 이례적이며 남부에서의 입지는 과소평가될 수 없습니다."

POLITICS_HENRY_WALLLACE_DESC:0 "아이오와의 찢어지게 가난한 농부라는 사회적 위치는 결코 헨리 월리스가 어린 나이에 세상을 보고 통찰력을 얻는 것을 단념시키지 못했습니다. 월리스는 주요 혁신인 하이브레드 옥수수 품종을 발명하여 막대한 부를 얻었고, 그렇게 얻은 재산으로 월리스는 세계 일주를 하게 됩니다. 헨리는 인도를 방문했고 그곳에서 당시 러시아에서 인기 있던 기독교 아나키즘과 사회주의의 요소를 이끌어냈던 힌두교 사상인 신지학(견신론)을 알게 되었습니다. 이러한 사상은 결국 월리스를 주류 사회주의로부터 멀어지게 했고 그는 미국으로 돌아와서는 농민노동당에 입당했습니다. 월리스는 그 누구보다도 실용적인 경제학자이자 미국에 절실히 필요한 농업개혁을 시행할 수 있는 농업전문가입니다."
POLITICS_JAMES_MURRAY_DESC:0 "A great controversy surrounded the election of James E. Murray during his election campaign. Tabloids and Republicans all came at Murray claiming that he cannot run for President due to being born in Canada. The truth of these statements may never be known, but his life prior to attending NYU is shrouded in mystery. His life began in earnest when Murray won the Governorship of Montana in 1933. His term as a Democrat was marked by an unusually cooperate relationship with unions and his bold belief that economic reform must disrupt a market if the market is failing."
POLITICS_ALBEN_BARKLEY_DESC:0 "Alben draws from over thirty years of political experience within the Democrat party and his own smart judgement. While Alben supported Wilson's reforms, he opposed McAdoo's attempts to reverse those policies. After several failed national election bids and a steady voting record, Alben was the right piece on the chess board in this election to gain the White House for the Democrats."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSELL_DESC:0 "The final ascent into the White House by Richard Russell Jr. is the final stroke in a long game that extends even before his time in the Democrat party. Russell Jr. has accumulated the right combination of titles in the US Navy, in the Georgian House of Representatives, and the US Congress to secure universal respect. His focus that de-segregation should happen entirely on southern terms proved popular with a national audience. Time will tell whether this position is sustainable."
POLITICS_GLEN_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Being President was just as much a surprise to Glen Taylor as it was to the voting public. The man that had wanted at one point to be a wandering preacher and then a country singer had finally reached a position that befitted his skills. Taylor was known in Congress as a compassionate economist and advocate of progressive policies and singing to children on the steps of the Capitol. Taylor's compassion fuled his opposition to segregation, and despite his eccentricities he has endeared himself to the American people, which is all he ever wanted."

POLITICS_EARL_WARREN_DESC:0 "Young Earl Warren thought his career was doomed when his father Mathias was blacklisted for joining a strike, but instead it motivated the young man into excelling past this stigma. This prior stigma motivated Earl into joining numerous fraternities and lodges in order to intermingle with the people that stigmatized his father, as well as serving in the military. These connections paid off and sent Earl into a life of public service and eventually reached the Governor seat of California in 1932, where he steered the declining Progressive movement towards the political center away from the even more declining West Coast Socialist Party. Earl became a progressive entryist within the Republican party, pushing for national desegregation."
POLITICS_CHARLES_MCNARY_DESC:0 "Charles McNary stood behind the foundation of the Republican party when it was under attack from all angles in 1936. A Progressive at heart but also a pragmatist, McNary was seen within the party as an insurance against the Northwest descending into radicalism, which also made him allies with an ally of Entente interests in North America. In fact, his company provided electricity to a significannot portion of Western Canada by the 1940s due to this relationship."
POLITICS_HARRY_TRUMAN_DESC:0 "세계대전 당시 미국이 그들의 중립과 고립주의 정책을 연장하기로 결정한 그 순간, 해리 트루먼이 대학 졸업장과 법학 학위를 포기하면서까지 준비했던 전장에서의 영광이라는 꿈은 좌절되고 말았습니다. 중앙아메리카에서 오랫동안 복무한 그는 현지에서 직접 경험한 게릴라 전술의 위력을 몸소 깨달았습니다. 트루먼은 이때 습득한 대게릴라 전술을 혼란스러운 미주리 주에 가져왔고, 1936년 혼란으로 피해를 입은 도시들을 구제하려는 상원을 도왔습니다. 이 공로를 인정받아 민주당 내에서 급격히 영향력을 쌓은, 이제 명백히 정치인이 된 트루먼은 뉴딜 정책의 지지자이기도 했습니다. 여기서 가장 주목할 만한 것은 그가 보수주의자들을 상대로 한 군 내부의 인종차별 철폐 운동을 공개적으로 지지한 것이었습니다."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_HARRIMAN_DESC:0 "Coming from a prominent business family with ties to international trade, William Harriman was able to establish several successful businesses in New York and became an important player in interstate trade. As the federal government has jurisdiction over those transactions, Harriman joined the Department of Commerce. A tactical minded approach to foreign policy and the goal of promoting America's ideology against the radicals that threatened her abroad resonated with Americans and pushed his career upwards."
POLITICS_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "The decision by Strom to turn the Conservative Manifesto into a raison d’état for the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party was a risky move. Strom had spent decades within the Democratic Party attempting to oppose the overreaching powers of the Federal Government, and ensuring that the party never officially endorse desegregation. This gamble has now paid off as Strom Thurmond has been elected President."
POLITICS_HAPPY_CHANDLER_DESC:0 "The turning point in Happy Chandler's career came during his intermission in politics to become the Commissioner of Baseball. A term as Governor had established Chandler as a respectable and industrious Democrat with a firm hand on the party line. This stint as Commissioner of Baseball saw a historical decision to allow integrated baseball teams, which led to the end of segregated baseball. This only further elevated Chandler as a Senator and made his decision to carry this support into the Conservative wing of the Democratic Party even more important. His insistence that fiscal conservatism and the race question were not tied together stood against Strom Thurmond's line..."
POLITICS_JOHN_BRICKER_DESC:0 "An advocate for limited executive power and a non-interventionist interpretation, John Bricker is as old fashioned a Republican as they come. Bricker's career prior to his presidency was that of a rabble raiser and dissenter within the Republican Party railing against suspected socialist sympathizers and opposing the use of executive power to push economic reform. The country as a whole having come close to populist or authoritarian dictatorships just a few years prior."
POLITICS_HAROLD_STASSEN_DESC:0 "While the senior Republican Party leadership like Willkie and Dewey had preoccupied the 1930s with the minutia of the 1936 crisis, Harold Stassen was serving in the US Navy and being exposed into the wider world. An important lesson learned is the importance of international cooperation as opposed to the tariffs that his fellow Republicans were pushing for. A firm opponent of international syndicalism, Stassen believes that laissez faire economic policies must be replaced by strategic economic cooperation There is no need to hold onto undemocratic institutions such as segregation which only feeds syndicalist arguments."
POLITICS_DWIGHT_EISENHOWER_DESC:0 "1915년, 유망한 사관생도 아이젠하워가 중앙아메리카에서 새로운 군사 교리를 시험하려 했었던 들끓는 열정은, 사관학교 동기인 현지 장군들이 형편없는 수준의 반란군을 이겨내는데 실패하면서 사라졌습니다. 사관학교 동기인 다른 현지 장군들은 독재와 급진주의에 대한 충동에 빠졌습니다. 아이젠하워는 연방정부와 각을 세워 민간정치의 영역에서 벗어나려고도 했습니다. 아이젠하워는 정치인이란 '대학 출신 왕의 똥개'라고 생각해서 정치인이 되기 싫어했습니다. 그러나 아이젠하워가 이런 생각을 가진지 약 4년 후, 그는 대통령 자리에서 취임선서를 하고 있습니다. 아이젠하워가 감독하던 군 내 인종차별 철폐에 대한 국가적 합의가 이런 상황을 만들어 냈습니다."
POLITICS_ADLAI_STEVENSON_DESC:0 "The reputation of Adlai Stevenson's father, that of an isolationist, dogged Adlai Stevenson II well into his political career. This position among the Democrats was put to the test with the American First Party, which depleted the party rank. Adlai stood to his roots during this most contentious time and persevered. As Governor of Illinois Adlai reformed the police force to be less at odds with socialists and even defended their rights to organize in the face of the Red Scare. Most doubted Adlai's ability to win against the respected General Eisenhower, but through an in kind appreciation from socialist voters Adlai won in the end."
POLITICS_JOHN_SPARKMAN_DESC:0 "Born in a log cabin and raised on a farm, John Sparkman had a very relatable upbringing. A rapidly ascending legal career and political clubs later and Sparkman had become the Democratic Representative for Huntsville. His victory being especially important in the fateful Year of 36 as he beat the AFP's candidate. Sparkman was instrumental in opening education up to immigrants and women in the South. Silent on social matters and bolstered by his support of science education, Sparkman spoke out against defensive US foreign policy, and eventually left for the Constitution Party, where his reputation put him on the fast track to presidency."
#Actually James Eastland not Harry Cain
POLITICS_HARRY_CAIN_DESC:0 "Son of the Mississippi Delta District Attorney, James Eastland was sidetracked from politics for the first three decades in order to run a plantation. An advocate of sharecropping who profited from their work until his plantation quadrupled in size. Eastland stood up in the Senatorial race against the Klan's candidate, and won. Against the Conservative Coalition, Eastman supported the Fair Deal legislation in his home state while voting for it in Congress. As his reputation and passage into the Constitution Party carried much weight, he successfully lead many Democratic voters to his campaign as the closest thing the party could offer to a national candidate."
POLITICS_CULBERT_OLSON_DESC:0 "Culbert Olson had faced both the stigma of running as a Mormon politician, and running as an atheist in his lifetime. In California as Governor, Culbert had to deal with long standing rumors that Mormons had a blood feud with the US Government. Olson's superb term as Governor in passing health care legislation and allowing non-SPA socialists to organize. By the time of the national race, Culbert had come out as an atheist, and faced a second uphill battle. The party stood by him, and ultimately his portfolio allowed him to reach the White House."
POLITICS_EMMETT_ANDERSON_DESC:0 "Hailing from Tacoma, Washington, Emmett T. Anderson was a successful printmaker before politics. During the Crisis of 36, Emmett ensured that presses for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer got out during the strike in Seattle. Emmett also ran his own pamphlets during the crisis decrying the Seattle Democrats as allies of the Silver Legion, and pressed to a peaceful end to the strike. After this the Republican Party got wind, and Emmett was elected to Congress. Eventually his actions were taken up on a national level by Republicans, and became a rallying cry against Democrats that made the difference during the election."
POLITICS_JOHN_GELLATLY_DESC:0 "오리건 주 벤턴 카운티에서 파산한 이후, 존 아서 겔라틀리는 책임감 있는 재정 보수주의자로서 자신을 표현해왔습니다. 1918년 워싱턴 주의 상원의원으로 선출된 이후, 겔라틀리는 1920-30년대에 걸쳐 여러 차례 주지사로 출마했고, 마침내 36년의 위기 동안 부주지사 자격으로 주지사직을 계승했습니다. 태평양 합중국의 건국자들은 신뢰할 수 있고 문제의 소지가 없는 공화당 후보자를 필요로 했고, 겔라틀리는 그 조건에 부합하는 사람이었습니다."
POLITICS_HOWARD_HUGES_DESC:0 "Son of an All-American family of ministers and inventors, Howard Hughes broke out of the Midwest by demonstrating a knack for engineering. After the tragic death of his parents, young Howard was thrust into a family fortune and a medical facility in Maryland. Using this vast fortune, Howard created the Summa Tool Corporation, a maker of fine industrial tools. The proceeds were funneled into Howard's Hollywood scripts, including the Academy Award winner 'The World Is Yours'. Expanding finally into Republican politics in California, Howard stood out among a crowd of old money. From RKO to a line of passenger aircraft, Howard was elected under the promise to finish Boulder Dam in Colorado and electrify the states."
POLITICS_FRANK_MERRIAM_DESC:0 "남북전쟁 참전용사의 아들인 프랭크 메리엄은 아이오와에서 태어났고 중서부 지방에서 인생의 계획대로 법조 경력을 쌓아갔습니다. 캘리포니아에서의 공화당의 급부상을 보자마자 프랭크는 자신의 직업을 서부쪽으로 옮기기로 마음먹었습니다. 메리엄은 캘리포니아에서 사회당과 롱아일랜드인의 파업을 물리쳐냈고, 심지어 우프톤 싱클레어가 주지사 후보로 지명되었을 때 반격까지 했습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고, 전통적으로 공화당 언론들은 메리엄의 세금 개혁에 반대했습니다. 맥아더가 권력의 정점에 오르자, 대부분의 공화당 언론들은 최고 경영자 허스트에 의해 모든 공화당원들을 비난하라는 주문을 받았습니다. 메리엄은 허스트와 맥아더에 대한 대중들의 항의의 표시를 통해 행정부수반의 자리를 확보할 수 있었습니다."
POLITICS_FLETCHER_BOWRON_DESC:0 "A California native and veteran of the Nicaragua War, Fletcher Bowron has a unique relationship with Latin Americans among Republican politicians. The first mayor of Los Angeles to support Cinco De Mayo parades, and an advocate of imprisoning radicals on suspicion. This coupled with Bowron's pursuit of organized crime impressed hardline republicans enough to put him in a greater office."
POLITICS_ROBERT_TAYLOR_DESC:0 "Robert Taylor Jones began as a civil engineer out of Tennessee. The most significannot project Jones was on was the Panama Canal. The boom of civil constructions out west drew Jones into Arizona, where he entered Democratic politics on a constructive platform. Serving as Governor of Arizona during the Crisis of 36, Jones countered the SPA and AFP candidates who sought to push the state into rebellion. Sadly, rebellion was forced upon the state when MacArthur came, and several democratic politicians betrayed the republic for autocracy. Thankfully Jones had contact with the true loyal Democratic Party, and campaigned for national office."
POLITICS_CLARENCE_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Clarence Martin came into prominence during a consequential Washington State election of 1932, which unseated many Republicans from state office. Clarence may have come in during a major shift, but his credentials in Washington included fostering small business and his unusually respectful discourse. Clarence on principle refused to exaggerate or appeal to populist tendencies in his election campaign, and distinguished himself in the Washington Senate by sponsoring necessary civil works projects. As the Democratic Party was able to wrest the civil works initiative from Republicans across the West, Clarence reaped the benefits politically and received more votes in 36 than Garner in Washington. The desertion of some Democrats to MacArthur only made Clarence's loyalty stand out, and his nomination to the executive chair that more likely."
POLITICS_OSWALD_WEST_DESC:0 "West was luck that the provisional government set up after MacArthur's rise did not specify natural born Americans, as he was born in Canada. Starting out as a Land Agent for Oregon, Oswald West was always diligent with his work. As Governor, West saw passage of Women's Suffrage, Worker Rights, and even state Prohibition, all strengthening the Democratic Party in the state. Taking the initiative to finance a State highway System without Federal money, West successfully pushed public projects. A more fervent advocate of conservative democratic laws on alcohol and even authorizing sterilization as punishment for breaking morality codes."
POLITICS_CHARLES_SPRAGUE_DESC:0 "A newspaper magnate and business owner, Sprauge got his start in Oregon politics as a newspaper commentator. Reprinted nationally and famed for his advocacy of small business, internationalization, and fiscal conservatism, many expected him to enter into Democratic politics. Sprauge instead ran as a Republican, and successfully capture democrat voters who supported a fiscally conservative but active Fair Deal. A surprising number of SPA also voted him into Governorship, as he supported their employment programs. This position he encouraged within the Republican Party, and eventually allowed him to gain support throughout the West."
POLITICS_RALPH_CARR_DESC:0 "A follower of Hoover's Republican Party, Ralph Carr's politics in Colorado were fiscally conservative and socially mixed. While Carr did deploy the National Guard to end the Green Mountain Dam Strike of 36, within the PSA Carr refused to imprison radicals. Going so far as to pardon several AFL labor leaders that were arrested without charges. Ultimately a Constitutionalist in a time of crisis where others were stretching legal boundaries. Carr was able to use this as leverage within the Republican Party to secure nomination and ultimately the election."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_LEE_DESC:0 "Joseph Lee was one of the first hard right Utahan Republicans, being elected only shorty after Mormons were allowed into Congress. While others resisted the draft on religious grounds, Lee joined the military and eventually fell on hard times after veterans’ pensions dried up. Running for Governor as a Republican and promising to promote Veteran Pay, Lee had also become acquainted with the old boys’ network of politics. This old boy’s network almost led to his dismissal after he was caught in an illegal gambling den by pro-AFP sheriff W. Skousen. Lee continued to advocate for fiscal conservatism and for admission of all religious right groups into Republican circles, which eventually got him nominated for the highest office."
POLITICS_MONRAD_WALLGREN_DESC:0 "Wallgren's career prior to politics was a combination of business management and pool sharking. A personable and approachable attitude helped jump-start his political career in Washington, especially during the close election of 36. The State Senate saw Wallgren's take an active role in national security, and advocate restricting press of radical elements, Wallgren stood firm as formerly Democratic papers were blacklisted along with SPA and AFP ones after they began supporting MacArthur. Wallgren's opposition eventually forced him out of the Democratic Party while in office, to which he responded by joining the up-and-coming Progressives."
POLITICS_CLYDE_TINGLEY_DESC:0 "Clyde Tingly came to New Mexico to heal his wife's TB, which was worsening in the Ohio weather. Tingly became incensed at the Republican rule in New Mexico, and so began a career in politics and advocacy for health-care reform. A supporter of early Fair Deal proposals, Tingly flew into office on the promise that a new governorship would allow for better usage of state funds. Albuquerque began recovering from the Great Depression under tingly even as most of the nation fell further, and his dedication to health care legislation pushed him into national politics where he became a Progressive."
POLITICS_ARTHUR_LANGLIE_DESC:0 "After a decade on the Seattle City Council. and another four years in the State Senate, Arthur Langlie was one of the youngest nationally recognized politicians in Washington history. Running against and losing to Monrad Wallgren, Langlie recouped and ultimately ingratiated himself into the Republican Party enough to win the nomination. Seen by many as a common man and exemplifier of the immigrant spirit, Langlie answers the Progressive claims to represent immigrant rights."
POLITICS_DOUGLAS_MCKAY_DESC:0 "Beginning work before he was out of High School, McKay thought his apex would be a used car dealership in Salem, Oregon. Instead, the Republican party encouraged him to run for local and then state offices, eventually being elected to the State Senate in 36. This climactic year saw McKay willingly leave his old supporters behind for the Progressives. An advocate for the national highway system, fiscally moderate Fair Deal policies, and a support for public works has moderated some of the Progressives more radical elements, and helped them take liberal Republican voting districts."
POLITICS_DANIEL_THORNTON_DESC:0 "Active in the 4-H and agrarian rights program, Daniel Thornton moved to Colorado from Texas in order to run a cattle ranch. A brief career in the State Senate combined with his strong personality made his campaign as a Republican to Governorship fairly easy. Known for his Stetson hat, cowboy boots, and smoking pipe, many reports have called Thornton the 'Republican Garner'. The media seemed to place him at odds with Richard Nixon during the election, but their mutual understanding to allow the elder politician to run made the difference at the end."
POLITICS_BOURKE_HICKENLOOPER_DESC:0 "Coming to the West after MacArthur's coup, Bourke initially had very little public support within the provisional government. Partnered with J. William Fullbright, Bourke helped the Republicans whip into shape, and pushed for an isolationist policy towards Canada and Japan. Seen by many as a patriot of a country on the brink of dissolution, Bourke won office by assuring a hard stand against all traitors to the American Republic."
POLITICS_VICTOR_MEYERS_DESC:0 "A multi-talented if not disparate man, Victor Meyers has been called the 'Pagliacci of Politics' in his early days. Back when his political career competed with his musical career. Insisting that the Democrats oppose Prohibition in Washington, he rode aboard a beer wagon during his Gubernatorial campaign. After this failed he began mixing Progressive policies with his natural talent to draw attention to himself. Promising tribes across the West voting rights, advocating pensions, child welfare and unemployment pay, Meyers was at times taken seriously and other times laughed at. A unique proposal for building single-pour concrete housing to solve the homeless issue proved to be both eccentric and effective. Ultimately the Progressives and the American people took him seriously enough to elect him into office."
POLITICS_ANDREW_HOCKENHULL_DESC:0 "A quiet and unassuming politician, Hockenhull rose through the ranks of New Mexican politics through his strong adherence to the Democratic Party line. So, his switch to the Progressive Party in 1928 was a pragmatic switch. Although he did not win the Governorship in 1936, Hockenhull persisted in the public service until the Progressives were forced to run him."
POLITICS_RICHARD_NIXON_DESC:0 "A native Californian and an obstinate quaker, Nixon attempted to join the FBI after college. After failing to do so, Nixon became a lawyer for the major oil companies of California. Nixon began a feud with fellow Republican Earl Warren, which persisted into the national political scene. Nixon took jobs prosecuting politicians in the Pacific States who were suspected of radicalism, and had a good winning record against socialists. Finally Nixon defeated Warren within the Republicans by promising him the Governorship of California in exchange for the National Nomination."
POLITICS_GEORGE_CRAIG_DESC:0 "Born in Brazil, Indiana, and trained to be a lawyer, George Craig was classmates with his eventual electoral rival, William Jenner. Craig would eventually compete with Jenner for the Republican Party nomination after his service during the Crisis of 36. Craig's service constituted defending the American Legion of Clay County against the SPA, which informed his later anti-socialism. As Governor of Indiana, Craig reformed the state government, and refused funds for the national highway in favour of local contractors."
POLITICS_VAL_PETERSON_DESC:0 "A school administrator in Nebraska for the first twenty years of his career, Peterson's introduction into politics came when he entered the US Air Force, and was assigned to trained with Hugh Butler. Butler eventually recommended him to Nebraska Governor Dwight Griswold. Peterson succeeded Griswold as Governor, and worked his way up the Republican Party power structure. Eisenhower recognized a fellow soldier and elevated Peterson within the Party, where he became a nationally recognized politician and presidential candidate."
POLITICS_JOHN_WINANT_DESC:0 "A life filled with difficulty prior to his ascent into office, John Winant's fortunes turned often. From dropping out of Princeton due to inability to pay, to the US Air Service. His military rank had distinguished himself enough to be elected Governor of New Hampshire, while also losing his remaining fortune in the Great Depression. Made Ambassador to Canada, Winant became torn between his duty and an affair with MP Churchill's daughter Sarah. This relationship was broken off, and ultimately his contacts in Canada made his election to the Liberals surer. The chaos of 36 continues to press upon Winant's mind however."
POLITICS_HERBERT_LEHMAN_DESC:0 "As of his inauguration, Herbert Lehman is the first Jewish Head of State in American History. Born into the storied Lehman family, and served in the US Army general staff, Lehman got his start supporting Al Smith's presidential campaign. Lehman served the rest of FDR's term after his death in 1921, and subsequent terms as Governor. Lehman opposed the conservative wing of the Democrats and opposed Eastland while addressing Congress. The Crisis of 36 forced Lehman out of NYC and into the provisional capital of Boston, where his shrewd dealings allowed him to secure safe passage of refugees into New England from the CSA."

POLITICS_CHRISTIAN_HERTER_DESC:0 "Born in Paris, and moving to Boston at a young age, Herter came into wealth via marriage to the Pratt family. Sent to the German Embassy, Herter would frequently recommend America intervene in the Weltkreig to no avail. His return saw him becoming Governor of Massachusetts, and the establishment of essential diplomatic ties with Canada that came into play in 37. Herter continues to advocate America's entry into the Entente, the liberation of democratic France, and the final justice of dismantling the German Empire. "

POLITICS_DENNIS_ROBERTS_DESC:0 "A quiet but integral member to the Democratic establishment, his cooperation with the Canadian Liberal party saw his rise through a Canadian sponsored election campaign. This campaign emphasized his loyalty to Rhode Island, his Naval service, and his voting record in favour of civil rights."
POLITICS_PETER_GERRY_DESC:0 "A protégé' of MP Lyon Mackenzie King, great grandson of VP Elbridge Gerry, and inheritor to a vast fortune, Gerry already had a leg up in politics. Becoming the Democratic Whip in the 1920s while a Senator for Rhode Island, Gerry worked his way up the political and social ladder. Marrying into and gaining the support of the Vanderbilt family helped Garry finance bailouts for Rhode Island businesses. MP King convinced Gerry to join the Liberals in 1940 in order to advance their common interest in social liberalism, which eventually paid off in his presidential campaign."
POLITICS_SHERMAN_ADAMS_DESC:0 "A career that spans Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and ultimately the executive chair. Serving as the Republican Speaker of the House in 1940, Sherman pushed through Old Age Pensions laws and worked towards a balanced budget Fair Deal road-map. This ultimately proved popular with Americans after decades of indecisive economic policy, and was used heavily in Sherman's presidential campaign."
POLITICS_ROBERT_BRADFORD_DESC:0 "A Republican in a strongly Democratic Massachusetts, Bradford's combination of fiscal conservatism and social liberalism helped make the case for his term as Governor in 1938. There Bradford successfully prevented strikes from going violent and used public funds to build homes to solve the housing issue. Bradford chaired a Silent Guest program during the turmoil of 36, asking Americans to donate the cost of a meal to the public relief for refugees from Macarthur. This charitable attitude continues into his term in the executive office."
POLITICS_MAURICE_TOBIN_DESC:0 "Tobin's career nearly ended when he was indicted for malpractice that caused the Coconut Grove fire of 1938. Tobin was charged with refusing to allow a club to be closed in order for safety measures to be installed. Tobin learned from this tragic mistake and became a rare Democratic supporter of unions. The union vote helped elevate Tobin within the Democratic Party, where he protected organization rights, and worked this into a reconciliation position during his national campaign."
POLITICS_PAUL_DEVER_DESC:0 "As a lawyer, Dever made a career in Boston defending business practices of corporations. This all changed when Dever enlisted in the US Army, and served alongside mixed race divisions. As he found out that most of these soldiers were in the Liberal party, Dever entered into politics under the Liberals. An uphill battle against Democrats in Massachusetts commenced that saw Dever promise veteran benefits and welfare extension."
POLITICS_GEORGE_AIKEN_DESC:0 "Aiken, the stalwart Republican and advocate of state-controlled Fair Deal legislation. Aiken in the State Congress passed laws to protect debtors during the Great Depression from losing their all-in debt collection. As Governor, Aiken instituted a pay-as-you go system for road maintenance that worked better than Fair Deal highways in New Hampshire. As a result, Aiken was chosen to run for the party nomination against conservative Republicans."
POLITICS_THOMAS_HART_DESC:0 "An admiral during the inter-war period, Hart had built a reputation of personal bravery and the ability to maneuver among politicians stateside. maneuvering helped by his marriage of his daughter into the Wilson political family. Ultimately Hart decided to run in national elections as a Democrat, appealing to the impoverished voting base of his native Connecticut."
POLITICS_CHARLES_POLETTI_DESC:0 "Unlike some of his more privileged Republican counterparts at Harvard, Democrat Charles Poletti was not born into one of the leading WASP families of the Northeast. The son of Italian immigrants, Poletti attended college on a scholarship, waiting tables to pay for textbooks. Quickly moving up the ranks of the Democratic party, Polletti's rustic charm enamored him with working-class voters across the country. Now President, Poletti has an ambitious reform agenda of racial integration, expanding welfare, and an aggressive anti-syndicalist international stance. Whether his domestic reforms will earn the support of his more conservative counterparts remains to be seen, however."
POLITICS_NELSON_ROCKEFELLER_DESC:0 "While some pundits are saying the name 'Rockefeller' alone catapulted Nelson to the presidency, Rockefeller's ascendancy to the highest office in the land was no given. Ivy League-educated, and initially working mainly in the business world, the radicalism among other Republican candidates encouraged Nelson to run for the presidency as a check on his more extreme counterparts. Using his family network to seize control of the nomination, Rockefeller's progressive approaches to health-care, welfare, and the economy may be the key to helping unite a divided country."
POLITICS_HENRY_LODGE_JR_DESC:0 "Born into a prominent political dynasty with roots in both New Jersey and Massachusetts, it was no surprise that Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. decided to enter national politics. With a strong family network to rely on, he quickly built a strong power base among the powerful WASP families of the Northeast, catapulting him to the Republican nomination, and now the presidency. More moderate and diplomatic than other Republican candidates, it remains to be seen which direction he will take America in internationally..."
POLITICS_OWEN_BREWSTER_DESC:0 "Hailing from the quiet forests of Maine, Owen Brewster has emerged as a national leader in the anti-syndicalist movement. While initially supporting Huey Long and the AFP in the early 1930's, Long's rejection of the Klan, close allies of Brewster, led to him rejoin the Republican party. Brewster is infamous in Maine, and across the country, for his open courting of the Klan, who were influential in his early gubernatorial and Senate victories. Now President of a divided America, it remains to be seen whether he can reconcile his divisive past with a new view for the future..."
POLITICS_STYLES_BRIDGES_DESC:0 "Formerly a teacher, Styles Bridges became the youngest governor in America when he emerged victorious in the 1932 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. Bridges then entered the Senate, earning a name as a ruthless anti-Syndicalist, not above using blackmail, treachery, and deceit to achieve his goals. In one of the most infamous incidents of the early 1930s, launched a major slander campaign in an attempt to label a leading SPA Senator as a 'rampant and notorious homosexual' and a 'traitor to the moral values of our nation'. This sensationalist attack earned him the enmity of Reed and the SPA, but enamored him with those opposed to Syndicalism. Now President, Bridges can turn his attention to stopping Syndicalism around the globe."

When the war was over, he formed the 'Centro Obrero Socialista' which would start the process of creating the 'Partido Socialista de Uruguay' in 1910, with Frugoni as its general secretary. He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalize, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."

In 1920 he was chosen as director of the Partido Nacional and was the president of the CNA from 1925 to 1927.\n\nWhile his reputation is far from perfect, with multiple conflicts with more radical and progressive factions within the PN, he has proven in the past that he has a genuine concern for the well-being of the Uruguayan citizens and workers.

POLITICS_LACERDA_TOT_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Frederico Werneck de Lacerda was born in 1914, the year the weltkrieg started, and his very name is significant to understand him; Carlos comes from Karl Marx, Frederico from Friedrich Engels, as his father was a socialist activist as well who greatly admired the duo; In time, he followed in his father's footsteps, and joined the CGT and became a full time leftist activist as early as 1932, when he put his law degree on the backseat to focus on the political realm entirely. Long involved in the Demoratic Left and before that the CGT, he found himself rapidly rising in the ranks of brazilian syndicalist circles, thanks to his no nonsense attitude and oratory talent; albeit some claim this is due to his father's influence, not his own talent. His faith in syndicalism is unabated by the crises that followed the past decade on the world, and he took an active part on bringing it to his home. Now, has taken up the great responsibility of leading his new nation, and to finish the fight against the capitalist rot of former Brazil for good, and seeks to implement extensive reforms on almost all matters of state. However, his somewhat aggressive demeanour may result in issues both domestically and abroad when it comes to close negotiations."
POLITICS_MINERVINO_OLIVER_RJM_DESC:0 "Like many of Brazil's poor, Minervino de Oliveira began to work as a child, and from his earliest years of adulthood he already was an influential union member, and also was an early member of the Brazilian Syndicalist Party and contributed to leftist newspapers. By the time the New Republic arose, he was a natural candidate to enter the political arena, and he entered Rio's city council in 1928. In the next decade, his staunch defense of workers rights and support of strikes garnered him many admirers and even more enemies. In 1936, his support to the Democratic Left front of João Mangabeira was a key point in the ideologically charged and contentious race. Thrusted into his new position by the liberation of his land, Mangabeira is the first of hopefully many leaders of this relatively young nation, and hopes to create a legacy of equality and prosperity that will contrast with the terrible legacy left behind by Brazil and its political cronies."
POLITICS_CARLOS_LUZ_RJM_DESC:0 "Carlos Coimbra da Luz was born in 1894 in a small town in the state of Minas Gerais, but later moved to the capital of Belo Horizonte to study, but the man always considered the town of Leopoldina, where his residence is located and where had had multiple terms as mayor. Having only recently joined the national stage of politics, Luz became a federal representative only recently in the 1936 elections with the ED, but since then has managed to maintain a steady political career, but always distrusted the further left members of that alliance, whom he saw as spies for foreign countries at best. An accomplished man who has performed varied roles, such as teachers, police captain and bank manager, Luz both understands the economic realities of the nation's hinterlands and the poverty that it's small towns have to endure, and has always positioned himself in favour of a less centralized taxation system, which is an oddity in his own party."
POLITICS_JK_RJM_DESC:0 "Hailing from the city of Diamantina in Minas Gerais, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira is the mother of a Mineiro father and a Czech mother, his middle name being the germanized spelling of Kubícek. After his father's death very early on his life, he began his studies, and eventually graduated from medical school and volunteered to aid in medical service during the Interstate War, and began his by now very long political career. Now faced with the challenge of ruling a nation wracked by war and in dire administrative straits, JK, as he is known by the people, has to not only deal with the ever competitive oligarchic politicians, but also with the ever looming threat of debt, as most taxation infrastructure did not make it past the war. But he also has big plans for both Rio and Belo Horizonte, cities in dire need of extensive public works, but already many in his opposition call these planes a ''hurricane of spending'', and yet he remains undeterred. Opposition to said remodeling is going to be especially complicated in Rio, where many attempts to do so have been thwarted in the past decades by numerous mayors and presidents."
POLITICS_TANCREDO_NEVES_RJM_DESC:0 "Born in 1910 in the city of São João del-Rei, southern Minas Gerais, Tancredo de Almeida Neves started to take an interest in politics as early as age nine, and already as a young man he opposed the then ruling party of his home state in the crisis that sparked the Interstate War. While he at first tried to volunteer for opposition militias, his remarkably poor aim and physical disposition had him rejected, and he spent the war at home, while having difficulties finding a job during the economic depression that hit the nation. Some years after the  interstate war, he joined the Republican party and began the slow climb through it's ranks, becoming a representative at city hall and the state legislature before heading to Rio's parliament. While his loyalties certainly lie with the Republicans, his somewhat moderate stances on key issues gave him a meaningful leg over other candidates, in what was a fairly contested election, even if the wanton violence of the war has been long left behind. His stances on economic and social issues are also why he has a relatively stable control of the upper and lower houses, but the complicated landscape left by the war may well surprise even the most skilled of politicians."

However, said endeavours are certainly easier planned than followed through, even with a relative control over the ever turbulent politics of Rio and Minas, there is no shortage of opposition for the so called radical ideas put forward by Afonso."
POLITICS_ARAKEN_OLIVEIRA_HOS_DESC:0 "Born and raised in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Araken de Oliveira has always had the interests of Brazil at heart throughout his distinguished military career. A war veteran and respected officer, his current position as head of state is in no doubt due to the fact that only the remnants of the brazilian army can maintain law and order throughout Vera Cruz. While the suspension, at least for now, of any kind of elections for executive power is indeed a harsh measure, harsh measures have to be taken if this young nation is to succeed in re-establishing the rule of law in both its cities and hinterlands, a task Araken has to undertake for the sake of his home."
POLITICS_BELISARIUS_PITY_DESC:0 "Belisário Augusto de Oliveira Penna was born in Barbacena, Minas Gerais, in 1868, and began his political career as a city councillor in Juiz de Fora, and only in the 1920s he projected himself outside of his home state, positioning himself in favour of right wing tenentist uprisings. For most of his life, he was a doctor and has a belief in scientific principles being applied to politics and governments. While a supporter of radical integralism, he often found himself marginalized even among that radical movement due to his beliefs regarding eugenics, a concept which he pioneered in Brazil, and he was for many years a member of the Central Eugenics Committee. These viewpoints have also granted him many allies and admirers that share similar beliefs, and now he and his associates are in a prime position to apply their ideas as practical principle, to ensure the great cities of the land like Rio are finally cleansed of its poverty and superstition that hide under the guise of 'local culture'. Belisário is also a supporter of utilizing political prisoners as a workforce, a controversial and divisive viewpoint even among the right winger clique that now form his cabinet."
POLITICS_BIG_MOURA_JR_DESC:0 "Olympio Mourão Filho was born in 1900, in Diamantina, Minas Gerais. Having followed a fairly standard military career, his first active combat duty was during the interstate war, where he was among the defeated officers that sided with the federal government. He has since completely and utterly lost faith in the very concept of liberal democracy, and has written books on the subject of a new kind of state, an ''Integral Democracy''. His republican beliefs have kept him somewhat distanced from the AIB, even if they did enjoy his full support in their ideals of dismantling the carcass of the republic as it currently stood. To him, an organic democracy is the conclusion of his studies and ideology, which also changed as the war took a turn for the worse. Now in a position to truly rule and liberate the lands of Vera Cruz from the blight of marxism and liberalism, Mourão leads the newly formed integralist movement in conjunction with similarly minded officers, even if many of the more monarchic elements have been tossed to the wayside, and will do everything in his power to ensure that his political mantra, where the Army, Navy and Paramilitary Militias sustain a united and strong integralist state where faith in God and in the nation are the principles to be maintained, instead of idolatry of wealth and syndicalism."

However, Lagrosillière continued his socialist advocacy in the Caribbean, continuing to become a politician in the West Indies Federation after the Weltkrieg.\n\nIn 1919, he made an electoral alliance with Fernand Clerc, a Béké industrialist on the island, which alienated him from his old socialist allies that criticized his 'alliance with capitalists'.

After working his way through high school, Aimé Césaire journeyed to the Commune of France in 1931, disgusted with the colonial system of the West Indies and seeking to pursue the kind of higher education he had been unable to attain on his home island. During his sojourn at the Sorbonne University, he joining with a cadre of other black students, eventually founding a newspaper dubbed "L'Étudiant Noir" which promoted anti imperialist ideals and railed against the exiled French Republic's treatment of their colonial subjects. Aimé also coined the term Négritude, a literary movement promoting a revitalisation of African and Caribbean culture, as well as condemned the irreparable damage caused by the "decadent, morally degenerated parasites" who had oppressed his people. Due to his increasing conflicts with fellow students and teachers in the Commune, which he attributed to racial tensions and prejudice, Aimé eventually chose to return back to the West Indies Federation, just in time to bear witness to the people of the Caribbean cast off their chains. Invigorated by the struggle for liberation, he directed his revolutionary zeal and anti colonial fury towards building up and impressive line of credentials, penning radical treatises and holding fiery speeches on what he desired and demanded the new socialist government must due for the victims of imperialism.

His family was poor and he received little schooling in his early years. In 1912, after the Xinhai Revolution, Burhan accompanied Tatar merchants to Dihua in Xinjiang and worked as an apprentice and store-clerk. In 1914, Burhan was able to apply and receive Chinese citizenship from the Republic of China on account of his family's ancestry. He spoke Uyghur, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, Turkish and some Arabic and acted as the interpreter for Xinjiang Governor Yang Zengxin. Burhan's relations to the Turkic community soured as a result of working under Yang Zengxin, and fellow Ughiers began to ostracize Burhan. Burhan's meager position in Yang's administration meant he was unable to mend this distrust, and the Ughier community's drift towards rebellion alienated Burhan further. Ultimately Burhan choose to attend courses at Baoding Army School starting in 1929, allwoging him to be hired by Yang as both an administrator and officer.

After the success of the revolution, he became governor of Guizhou and would later return to his home province of Yunnan in 1913 to replace Cai E. When Yuan Shikai announced his ambitions of becoming an Emperor, Tang immediately seceded with the support of the likes of Cai E and Li Liejun, who would spearhead the National Protection War alongside Tang. With their victory in the National Protection War, Yunnan became one of the main hegemons of the continent.\nSince then, Yunnan's glory days have long since faded away. Tang has led one failed expedition after another, with his failure in defeating Sichuan causing him to almost be deposed by Gu Pinzhen in a coup d'etat in 1921. However, the failure of the Northern Expedition became a blessing for Tang's control over Yunnan. With the threat of the Zili Clique and their German Patrons looming in the distance, the presence of the surviving NRA members as well as Tang's own forces have largely deterred them from taking action against a seemingly hostile Republican province. However, Tang's flamboyant and over ambitious character have largely alienated many of the officers residing in Yunnan, and his control over the province is much weaker than it seems from the outside."

Alongside most of the remaining 3rd NRA army, he returned back to his home region of Yunnan, beginning to build up a new career within Tang Jiyao's administration.\nWhen Tang's government fell, Zhu Peide seized the oppertunity to rally the remnants of the Rightist Kuomintang and denounce Long Yun's takeover.

The young Yi general has served with the Kuomintang, fought with the Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang of Indochina, and now lead a daring coup against his former comrades.

He joined a local militia and fought in the Xinghai revolution, climbing through the ranks until he was serving under Tang Jingyu as commander of the Fifth Army, within the Yunnan Clique. His rise to power was helped by the close comradeship he held with his superior, as well as his alleged half-brother Lu Han. Yet in time, these friendships would be tainted with political rivalry and a heated competition for power in the declining revolutionary movement. It has taken many sacrifices, many betrayals and certainly regrets, yet Long Yun has now risen to lead the Yunnan Clique as its new warlord.\nLong's hold over Yunnan is tenuous but determined, he holds plenty of ambitions to remain a leading figurehead for the coming years, yet just like how he ousted his predecessor there's a distinct risk his own subordinates could turn on him at any minute. This is not helped by Long's ethnic background as a member of the Yi minority, although it has helped foster friendships between his administration and his kinsfolk.

At nine years of age, he was taken in by a wealthy uncle and later sent to study at Yunnan Military Academy. His time at the academy saw him enlist in the Tongmenhui, the predecessor to the Kuomintang. The next years in Zhu De's life were a turbulent series of travels throughout China, fighting at various revolutionary fronts with the National Republican Army, serving various political factions and building up a great network of connections. From Sichuan to Shanghai, Tibet and even a brief stint as a student in Berlin, the roads of fate eventually lead Zhu De back to Yunnan. In recent years he fell afoul of the warlord Tang Jiyao's despotism, being driven to resign his position in the National Republican Army and promise to abstain from politics rather than face an umpteenth journey around the Asian continent.\nZhu De had perhaps expected to spend the rest of his life as a teacher at the Yunnan Military Academy, yet the news that Tang's government had fallen, and that all hell was breaking loose in Yunnan convinced him resurface from obscurity.

POLITICS_YUNNAN_LI_XIN_DESC:0 "Li Xin initially attended a German Private school in Kunming, where after he would study at various universities around the country. He first studied agronomy in Nanjing's South Eastern University, but was transferred to Beijing Agriculture University. During his stay in the Northern capital he became increasingly interested by foreign political thought, studying the failed Bolshevik movement in Russia and the now ascendant Syndicalist ideology in Europe. Throughout the 20s he grew increasingly closer to Syndicalism and later with other radical students at the university to form a political group named the "Renovation Society" in order to promote leftist views. After graduating in 1926, he traveled to Guangzhou and attended a lecture held by the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang on Agricultural Socialism. Although Li was at this point enamoured with Syndicalism, he accepted a request from the political representatives to join the Communist Party and help organise a political movement back in his home province of Yunnan. Dubbed the "Yunnan Special Branch", this group was initially meant to collaborate with its superiors but lost contact with the mother party following the failure of the Northern Expedition.\nLi, as one of the key figures in the group began to apply the same ideological currents which had dominated the Renovation Society, building an underground intellectual society of Syndicalist radicals in the heart of Kunming. This lead to a large schism between those loyal to the Special Branch's original beliefs, and Li's Syndicalist influence, eventually leading to Li's party founding 'Xindianshe' or 'The New Society' as a separate group. Despite his revolutionary convictions, Li has managed to remain below the radar of Tang's government. Initially several warlords in Yunnan were aware of his leftist beliefs, but had little reason to persecute a simple agricultural scholar. That all changed when Li Xin journeyed to various Yunnanese tin mines, hoping to organize the workers into a union. He even disguised himself as a miner, toiling away in hopes of growing closer to the proletariat. After organizing a wildcat strike in 1929 Li was almost arrested and executed, which forced him to go into hiding. Since then he has continued to grow his political influence, hoping to once more unite the Yunnanese workers and show the warlords what power truly lies in the hands of the proletariat."

Early on he began to associate with radical student groups, getting to know several influential figures such as Li Xin and Li Dazhou. While many of his comrades dabbled in studying the newly resurgent Syndicalist movement that was sweeping through Europe and America, Wang remained a committed Marxist. He later joined Li Xin's "Renovation Society", a leftist group which promoted socialist ideology at Beijing University. During this time he witnessed many of his comrades be repressed, arrested and even executed by the Beijing government, driving him down a vengeful and authoritarian path. Much like his colleague Li Xin, he met with members of the Chinese Communist Party and Leftist Kuomintang, being similarly instructed to travel back to Yunnan and organize socialists within the province. The hope was to topple the warlord Tang Jiyao's hold over the south west, by founding a 'Yunnan Special Branch' of the Communist Party that could ferment revolution.\nYet the Special Branch was nearly annihilated when the Northern Expedition failed, and its superiors among the CPC and Leftist Kuomintang ended up scattered to the wind. Worst of all for Wang, his own comrades now began to turn on him. Rejecting the old authorities they had followed and beginning to rally around Li Xin's own syndicalist views. Outraged, Wang seized control of the special branch and moved to expel Li. During his tenure as leader of the underground revolutionary society, he worked to regain contact with whatever remnants of the Kuomintang or CPC might still be organized and continuing the fight in China. After years of silence and falls leads, he finally found them. The ZhongTeJu, and through a series of secret meetings, encoded messages and risky plans, the Yunnan Special Branch was restored to its original purpose: To ferment revolution against the Yunnan warlords. Despite his new superiors and the schism with his old comrades, Wang remains diligently committed to one single goal, revolution before all."

The constant struggles and repeated failures of the Kuomintang to consolidate their hold over China eventually lead Fan to retire from the military, taking up work as a doctor in Kunming. He was content to remain as an apolitical civilian, until he caught Tang Jiyao's attention. Already familiar with each other from their time in the revolution, Tang managed to convince his old comrade to return to the army. Fan has now traded in his robes and rickshaw for a uniform and rifle, attaching himself to the recovering republican movement."

After graduating from the Kunming Academy in 1924, he decided to join the KMT in Guangzhou and continued his study at the Whompa Military Academy. However, frustrated with the hidden corruption within the Nationalist Government, he left for Shanghai to work after graduation. In 1929, he was invited back to Yunnan to serve as a tutor in the Kunming Academy. Since then, he has become a leader of the progressive wing of young Republican officers in the Kunming Academy, calling for anti-corruption and reducing poverty."

POLITICS_YUNNAN_ZHAO_XINGWU_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 19th, 1898\nBinchuan County, Yunnan, Qing Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§L\nZhao travelled to Kunming and attended Yunnan Law School in 1917. Although he was too young to participate in the Xinhai Revolution or the National Protection War, the stories of what was happening around China thrilled him. During his stay in Kunming he began reading political literature, both the more mainstream democratic manifestos but also digging into forbidden communist propaganda that had been outlawed under the warlord Tang Jiyao's rule. After attempting to organize political activities among his fellow students, he was expelled from the school. Outraged at this censorship, Zhao decided to leave Yunnan and join the Kuomintang's armies to the east. During the coming military campaigns he served as an officer under Zhu Peide, distinguishing himself thanks to his analytical mind and aptitude for strategic thinking. It was also around this time he first joined the Communist Party of China, but his hopes of working with fellow socialists both within the party and the Kuomintang was short lived. The failure of the Northern Expedition broke the democratic and socialist movements in southern China, forcing Zhao to flee back to Yunnan alongside his superior Zhu Peide. During his exile, he distanced himself from both the the other rightist Kuomintang exiles. He began to correspond and meet with various members of the now scattered leftists, becoming a key liaison to them in Yunnan. Zhao has gone from leading students, soldiers and now exiles, but despite it all he still maintains a great skill for leadership and a zealous devotion to socialist ideals."
POLITICS_YUNNAN_GONG_SHOU_DESC:0 "The latest in a long line of Yi Tusi, a form of regional hereditary chieftain in the old imperial bureaucracy, Gong Shou rose to prominence thanks to his unscrupulous political flexibility and zealous defence of the southern minorities' autonomy. Although initially born with the name Dāo Yuè Chūn, he served as Tusi of the Nandian Prefecture up until the Xinhai Revolution. Sensing political change sweeping through China, Shou changed his name to Gong and began to promote an elaborate story that his family were in reality descendants of Ming dynasty soldiers who had occupied Yunnan. The decision to pass himself off as a member of the Han ethnicity earned Shou a considerable degree of influence in the post-revolutionary political climate, which he used to campaign against the attempted land reforms that would weaken the Yi people and their Tusi's autonomy. Although it landed him a stint in prison, he was later released and continued to live with this unique ethnic duality, spending some days as the Han politician Gong Shou and others as the Yi Chieftain Dao YueChun."
