 POLITICS_FERDINAND_I_DESC:0 "1887년, 페르디난트 폰 작센코부르크고타가 불가리아 공으로 선출되었다는 소식은 실로 믿기 어려운 것이었습니다. 전임 공작 바텐베르크의 알렉산더르가 퇴위했을 당시, 이 숫기없고 별난 오스트리아-헝가리군 장교를 적격자로 상상한 이는 거의 없었습니다. 이후 50여년간 가파른 오르막과 내리막이 있었지만, 결국 페르디난드는 불가리아의 가장 오랜, 또한 가장 위대한 통치자로 자리잡게 되었습니다.\n\n페르디난드의 성향은 전제적이고 권위적이었지만, 그는 터르노보 헌법 하의 제한된 민주주의를 수용했습니다. 그 대가로 공국의 외교정책을 장장 수십년에 걸친 오스만과 발칸의 인접국들과의 전쟁으로 이끌어, 불가리아에게 “발칸의 프로이센”이라는 별칭을 선사했습니다. 그런 와중 1908년에는, 불가리아 제3차르국 차르의 칭호를 수여받고 동로마 제국의 황위를 주장하는 것으로 권위를 드높였습니다. 비록 제2차 발칸 전쟁으로 그의 야심은 잠깐 좌절되었으나, 잔혹했던 세계대전은 차르가 영원한 대불가리아를 재건할 수 있도록 허락했습니다.\n\n이제 나날이 노쇠해가는 페르디난드는 권력의 대부분을 보리스 왕세자에게 위임했습니다. 하지만 그는 여전히 불가리아인들에게 중요한 상징으로 남아 있습니다. 위대한 재건자, 불가리아 제3국가의 모든 영광의 기수인 그가 지휘봉을 잡고 있는 한, 불가리아의 번영은 끊이지 않을 것입니다."

 POLITICS_BORIS_III_DESC:0 "1894년 1월 30일, 101발의 축포와 함께 페르디난드 1세의 장남인 보리스 폰 작센코부르크고타의 탄생이 포고되었습니다. 절대다수 정교회 국가의 왕세자로서 태어난 보리스는 즉시 전국적인 주목을 받았습니다. 러시아 제국의 축도에 이어, 페르디난드는 아들이 정교회 세례를 받고 불가리아식 이름을 가질 것을 천명했습니다. 어린 시절 왕세자는 불가리아 표준 교육과정, 여러 언어, 사관학교 훈련부터 심지어는 증기기관차 운용법까지 다분야의 교육을 철저히 받았습니다.\n\n발칸전쟁과 세계대전에서, 연대장을 거쳐 불가리아 육군 참모총장의 보좌관으로 복무한 왕세자는 큰 충격을 받았습니다. 참호를 시찰하며 비대하고 빈곤한 불가리아군이 콜레라로 고통받는 모습을 목도한 그는 점점 평화주의적 신념을 가지게 되었습니다. 소문이긴 하지만, 부왕이 세계대전 참전을 반대하는 왕세자를 꾸짖으며 며칠 간의 가택연금을 명령했다는 이야기가 돌기도 했습니다. 전쟁이 끝나고, 그는 평화로운 전후 환경에서 왕세자로서의 책무를 계속해왔고, 현재에 들어서는 이미 나날이 노쇠해가는 부왕을 대리한 집무까지 수행해왔습니다. 차르가 퇴위한 이제는 본인이 왕좌에 앉아 그렇게 할 뿐입니다.\n\n보리스 3세는 여러 면에서 아버지와는 다릅니다 - 페르디난드는 전제적이고 권위적인 군주였지만, 보리스는 진중하고, 차분하면서도 이미지 관리에 적극적입니다. 거의 모든 사람과 친구가 될 수 있는 사교성은 덤입니다. 보리스는 아버지보다 협상과 양보에 더 개방적일지도 모르지만, 만약 기회만 생긴다면, 아버지보다 훨씬 확고하게 국가를 장악할 수 있을 것입니다."
 POLITICS_STAMBOLIYSKI_DESC:0 "소작농 출신의 농학자, 알렉산다르 스탐볼리스키는 수십 년 동안 불가리아 정계의 급진주의자로 활동해왔습니다. 그의 정당인 불가리아 농민국민연합은 터르노보 제헌회의나 스테판 스탐볼로프 독재정권 계통이 아닌 최초의 정당으로, 대신 농촌 소작농들에게서 확립된 이념을 기반으로 하고 있습니다. 마르크스주의 논증을 차용하여, 스탐볼리스키는 불가리아에서 가장 많은 노동력을 기여하는 농만아 불가리아를 통치해야만 한다고 선언하고, 이에 따른 국가구조의 개편을 요구했습니다. 스탐볼리스키는 불가리아 최초로 군주제를 부정한 정치 인사였고, 따라서 그의 경력에는 언제나 박해가 함께해왔습니다.\n\n세계대전이 시작될 무렵, 그는 오스트리아-헝가리에 맞선 세르비아인의 투쟁을 지지하면서, 자신은 불가리아인이 아닌 "남슬라브인"이라고 선언했습니다. 1년 뒤, 그는 과격한 반전주의적 발언으로 종신형을 선고받았지만, 몇 년 후 풀려났습니다. 1923년 바실 라도슬라보프 총리가 의회 농민파의 협상 끝에, 그들의 지지를 받는 대신 스탐볼리스키를 사면하기로 약속한 결과였습니다. 그러나 스탐볼리스키는 세르비아 혁명이 시작되자마자 세르비아로 도망쳐 다시 군주제에 저항하기 시작했습니다. 세르비아에서 그는 다른 공화주의 야당들과 접촉하고 사회주의자들과 연합했습니다.\n\n자신이 구상하는 불가리아를 실현할 기회만을 갈망하는 스탐볼리스키는 "농민민주주의"에 대해 말하고 있지만, 사실 통상적인 민주주의는 그의 이상과는 거의 들어맞지 않습니다. 불가리아를 농민이 지배하게 되고, 스탐볼리스키가 그들의 호민관이라면, 그가 절대적인 권력을 쥐는 것은 당연한 일 아닐까요?"
 POLITICS_GEORGIEV_DESC:0 "Colonel Kimon Georgiev was born to a middle-class family in the short-lived Principality of Eastern Rumelia, before its unification with Bulgaria. Much like his peers bereft of wealth, he enrolled in the Military School and graduated as an infantry lieutenant. His career in the Bulgarian Army saw him fight in both of the Balkan Wars and the Weltkrieg, during which he lost one of his eyes. No longer able to command his unit from the front lines, he was appointed as an instructor and later into the army staff, allowing him to create the Military Union - an organisation of active and reserve Bulgarian officers seeking to represent their voice in politics.\n\nMuch of the 1920s passed without note for the Colonel, working as an army instructor, commanding units against Serbian chetniks in Macedonia and teaching in the Military School. The Serbian Revolution and the subsequent political events in Bulgaria changed all that. Alongside the Military League, Georgiev fully endorsed the authoritarian regime of Konstantin Georgiev and was appointed as Minister of Railways and Telegraphs in his cabinet. When the Prime Minister fell, Georgiev vehemently defended him. Not only was the State Protection Act a necessity to him, but the failures of the parliamentary regime increasingly frustrated him.\n\nGeorgiev turned to his comrades, especially Damyan Velchev, and the two founded the Zveno political circle in 1928, with the goal of a new, stronger regime for Bulgaria. Unlike the discipline of the Army, politicians are irrational, immoral and short-sighted - so surely, it falls to the good men of the Army to put things back into order. With or without the antiquated regime on the throne."
 POLITICS_DOCHEV_DESC:0 "Born in Shumen in 1908, Ivan Dochev grew up in the Greater Bulgarian dream, and was the son of a reserve officer. Unlike his father and many of his peers in the National Legions, Dochev did not pursue an army career and enrolled to study law at the University of Sofia instead. Although poverty and problems with the law forced him to interrupt his studies several times. The activist students of Bulgaria were the first to recognise that there was something rotten to the core with their beloved Bulgaria. In spite of the half-hearted speeches and rallies to display Bulgarian greatness, the country was poor, weak, and politically paralysed. The great revolutionary upheaval in Europe did not miss Sofia, emboldening not just socialists, but also those who saw it as a disease.\n\nDochev battled his Serbia-sympathetic coursemates in the streets of Sofia after the Serbian Revolution and joined the organisation "Rodna Zashtita". Soon disillusioned with it, Dochev rallied his peers to a splinter group, the Union of Bulgarian National Legions. Vehemently nationalist, xenophobic and openly militant, it swiftly absorbed its fellow radical organisations and turned into a hegemon of the far-right, and Dochev was their "Bulgarian Codreanu". As the head of the Legions, he travelled across the country and, if the rumours are true, met one of the commanders of the Ohrana in the Osogovo Mountains, who offered his endorsement to the young student.\n\nThe Fourth Balkan War caught Dochev straight out of university, and alongside thousands of his peers, he served in the front, his resolve only growing stronger and his bitterness turning even greater when he learned of the humiliating peace. No longer was he merely a young student thrust into political life - he was now a veteran, and alongside thousands of veterans he marched, to bring his country back on track, no matter how much it costs."
 POLITICS_VASEV_DESC:0 "Of his comrades, Manol Vasev stands out not just due to his dedication to anarchism and Syndicalism, but also his relative mystery. "Manol Vasev" is not his real name, it is Iordan Sotirov, and was born either in Kyustendil, or in the unidentified village of "Tahandzhik", in 1898. As a young man, Sotirov was involved in the tobacco worker trade union movement in Kyustendil and rose to lead the trade union movement in the region. After Konstantin Georgiev's rise to power, he organised strikes of tobacco workers and fled Kyustendil after crackdowns began. He was sheltered by fellow anarchist leader Delcho Vasilev in Haskovo - here, Sotirov erased his old identity and became Manol Vasev, once again involving himself in the revolutionary struggle.\n\nAfter the Georgiev era and the subsequent years of growing royal control, Bulgarian anarchists and syndicalists changed their strategy. The Bulgarian labour movement was too small and weak to build a revolution on - however, the impoverished peasantry was in constant threat of rebellion, and could be channelled to their needs. Mass peasant strikes in 1932 led to the establishment of the Agricultural Professional Confederation "Vlasovden", a congress modelled after trade union congresses in Western countries which was intended to prepare the Bulgarian peasantry for revolution. This Confederation also experimented with communal practice, establishing agricultural cooperatives under Syndicalist principles in the Haskovo region and drawing the ire of local authorities.\n\nArmed peasant militias, aligned with Vlasovden, played a key role in the revolution which overthrew the Tsar after the Fourth Balkan War - and for once, the Bulgarian syndicalists could finally put their theory in practice, showing the world that Syndicalism can be adapted far and wide, not just in the industrialised West."
 POLITICS_DIMITROV_DESC:0 "Georgi Dimitrov was born to the family of a Bulgarian refugee from the southern Balkans in the aftermath of the Treaty of San Stefano, fleeing to the newly established Principality. Here, they lived poor factory worker lives, and all of their sons eventually became socialists, although only Georgi survived. In 1900, he became secretary of the Sofia Union of Printers, and joined the newly established Narrow Socialist faction of the BRSDP in 1903. During the prewar period, he organised trade unions in Bulgaria, and was elected to the Sŭbranie on a socialist platform in 1915. Dimitrov's career as a parliamentarian was short, however, as he was stripped of immunity and arrested two years later for protesting the treatment of wounded soldiers.\n\nTwo years later, Dimitrov was released and went into exile, eventually reaching the Commune of France and reconnecting with the rest of the party leadership. Though the success of the French revolution was inspirational, Dimitrov soon turned into a critic of the Communard regime, publishing treatises on how the French system cannot be adapted by more backwards states, such as Bulgaria - if a revolution takes place in Bulgaria, then a strong revolutionary vanguard must first dedicate itself to the modernisation of the country, and only then progress towards "Western socialism". The Narrow Socialists adopted his theses.\n\nPersonality wise, Dimitrov is hardly a flattering picture, described as having "the coarse and calculating realism of the Bulgarian peasant" and changing his mind on who to flatter and who to criticise depending on who is in power. Still, however, he is a determined revolutionary, and the fall of the Tsardom allows him to pursue his vision for Bulgaria at last."

Back in the late 19th century, the cleavage between the liberal and conservative factions in the Constitutional Assembly in Tarnovo was the defining difference between parties - and while those days are long gone and who stood for what in 1878 is no longer relevant, the People's Progressives claim heritage to those who stood by the Prince and for a responsible parliamentary system so many years ago.\n\nTheir leader, Atanas Burov, has gained a reputation as a strong supporter of civil rights and maintaining the Tarnovo Constitution - a stance which has since led him to negotiate with the Petorka. Feeling confident in his sway over the incumbent coalition, Burov has thus requested a meeting with the Prime Minister, and presented his wish to see the Second Concentration take a stand for democracy. Not only should they not surrender even more power to the Tsar, but they have a moral prerogative to defend the document which signalled Bulgaria's rebirth as an independent state.\n\nHow does Stainov reply?"

The setting of the meeting was a visit and inspection of one of the Bulgarian Army's newly modernised cavalry divisions, who the General assured will play a leading role in any future war against their enemy in Belgrade.\n\nGeneral Zlatev aimed to assure the Prime Minister regarding any of his fears - they are not a Codreanite clique, far from it, and do not seek to involve themselves with the poisonous rhetoric of the regime in Bucharest. Rather, they see themselves as technocrats, masters of the craft of politics who will be able to transform the country for the better, if only they are able to have a say. The Prime Minister does not even have to imagine this as a violent revolution - there is no need for the Tsar to lose his head, or for all of Bulgaria's political tradition to be tossed out of the window. Zlatev can personally assure Stainov that he will do whatever it takes to prevent "dangerous radicals" such as Damyan Velchev from getting their way - all he wants from the politician is his support in their hour of need.\n\nWhat does Stainov say?"

Run by the aforementioned family, Bŭklovi rapidly expanded credit during the 1930s, riding off the wave of the economic miracle in Germany all while offering loans to more and more untrustworthy debtors. This might not have been an issue a few years ago, as the profits from their operations would be more than worth the risk, but now this overconfidence has bitten them back, millions of leva in loans are expected to never return to the bank, and its own debts mount by the day.\n\nA collapse of the bank is imminent, and would likely lead to the collapse of Bulgaria's financial system.

Vehemently nationalist, anti-capitalist and anti-semitic, they are clearly inspired by the similarly named regime in Romania, even if they recognise that they are Bulgaria's biggest enemy.\n\nThe destitution across Bulgaria following the Black Monday crisis has empowered the Legions. Not only that, but its leader Ivan Dochev and other Legionaries took advantage of the crisis, organising massive rural relief actions to aid the peasantry in their hours of need. Thousands of Legionaries have marched to the countryside, aiding the peasants in their harvests and propagandising their ideals along the way.\n\nAt the moment, the Legionaries are an ally of Zveno - however, this alliance is brittle, and it's no mystery that the radicalised young officers have their own agenda."

A staunch advocate of a pro-German course, Zhekov also finds considerable common ground with the movement there. Of course, the old retired general was still somewhat hesitant, because of his typical conservatism.\n\nGeneral Hristo Lukov was a lot more dedicated in his follow-up article - and the rumours say that he is directly involved with the Legionaries, even possibly considered as an alternate leader if they ever seek to make themselves more presentable to the general population. Both of these commanders were greatly critical of the current regime, of course - almost to the point of shunning democracy entirely.

This faction rebuilt the power base of the original BZNS and even negotiated a release of their original leaders, including Stamboliyski himself, for a brief period of time in the 1920s.\n\nThe Serbian Revolution once again broke the party in twain, and Stamboliyski alongside the republican members of the party moved to the underground due to their unabated support for the revolution in Belgrade. Later events led to further splinters in the large, yet divided Agrarian movement. Today, five parties calling themselves BZNS exist in Bulgaria, although only three are relevant - "Vrabcha 1" and "Pladne" are legal and are represented in the Petorka, the latter a bit more radical than the former, and "Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski", or BZNS "United", which operates in the underground, openly cooperates with socialist forces, and declares itself fighting for a Bulgarian Republic.\n\nIt was believed that these factions had drifted apart significantly - however, as political battles grow tense across the nation, Bulgarian police are starting to reveal... connections between the underground BZNS and their seemingly moderate and innocent counterparts in the Sŭbranie.

It might even be necessary to alleviate the pressure on the economy and prevent additional bank runs.\n\nKnowing his importance in the system, Burov now offers the Prime Minister a deal - he will personally ensure a smooth transition in the Bulgarian financial sphere, even taking the measures to lessen the monopolistic ambitions of the BTB to ensure long term economic health - while in exchange, the Prime Minister will allow a vote on abolishing the State Protection Act.

The Stamboliyski faction of the Agrarian National Union, working underground, has been agitating in favour of the strike.

Still, as the two had common enemies, they found it acceptable to leave these issues behind for some time.\n\nThe defeat in the Fourth Balkan War has ended well for Zveno, its political strength faltering, while the Legionaries have only grown during said time. Unwilling to accept the catastrophic defeat, they call for a repudiation of the treaties with the Pact and vengeance for a so-called "stab in the back" to the Bulgarian Army, which was about to win the war and yet was betrayed.

Already, several orders for nationalisation have been issued, mainly directed to the tobacco and alcohol industry, but the ambition of the Zvenari extends further. Kimon Georgiev and Damyan Velchev have ambitions to turn the Bulgarian economy into an organ of its state, and give examples across the world where state-planned industrialisation has yielded great results.\n\nThey are opposed by their conservative allies, however, who believe that the current economic structure of Bulgaria should not be upset too much.

This goal of national rejuvenation can be interpreted differently from person to person, however.\n\nThe republican members of Zveno, gathered around Damyan Velchev, see the Directorate as a tool to completely reshape Bulgarian culture. They lay down totalitarian goals for the institution, envisioning mass application of media, control of information and distribution of correct ideological material in order to imbue Bulgarian people with obedience, loyalty, and discipline. This is denounced as delusion by other members of the clique, however, who call for the Directorate to instead take up the call of moral crusade.

How far this centralisation will go, however, and what form will the Zveno regime take in the future are still up to debate.\n\nWhile conservative members of Zveno would prefer to just create an autocracy, presumably with the Tsar still in charge, their opinion is not shared by everyone. The core republican faction sees value in not merely absolute leadership, but one with an empowered bureaucracy below it. The issue with old Bulgaria was the incompetency of the administration, they say, therefore Zveno's regime should pursue complete rationalisation of the political system and an emphasis on technocratic rule."

Historically, the Legionaries are a royalist movement, professing their loyalty to the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, even though the controlling nature of their monarchs and German birth make this stance rather eclectic.

Burov explained his reason for visiting simply - the Tsardom will not survive at this rate, a fact which neither of them can accept. Obviously, the Tsar does not want to lose his throne, while Burov believes that the alternative, a military-enforced republic, will be even more nighmarish.\n\nInstead, the politician offers a pact - full support not only by his party, but the entire Bulgarian democratic spectrum, in exchange for a new page in Bulgarian history. Not only does he demand the restoration of the Constitution of Tarnovo, but also full constitutional reform which will transform Bulgaria into a full constitutional monarchy. The role of the Tsar will be minimised to a ceremonial role, no different from the British monarchs. It will be an end to half a century of the Tsars' efforts to consolidate power, ended in a stroke.\n\nFinally, Burov assures that he and the other leaders of the constitutionalist movement have enough contacts and backing among civil society and the military to ensure a smooth transition, with no threat of a military coup."

It was first founded in 1933, and received a head-start with the donation of hundreds of thousands of lev by the engineer Virgil Ionescu, which even earned him a promotion to lead the branch first in Constanta and then across all of Dobrogea. Though it officially declared itself to be a branch of the party in Bucharest, in practice, it was autonomous due to the difficulty of controlling this branch behind the tense Bulgarian-Romanian border. This autonomy has led to the Dobrogean Iron Guard working alongside local parliamentary Romanian parties, under the premise that all Romanians must work together, not unlike the PNR in Transylvania - an awkward situation considering the Iron Guard's stance towards the old parliamentary parties in mainland Romania.\n\nCiting the organisation's collusion with foreign elements, vehement anti-Bulgarian rhetoric, and their plotting against the security of the Bulgarian State, the authorities have finally dissolved it. Its headquarters in Constanta were raided by police, several of its leaders, including Ionescu himself, were arrested, and its property was seized.

Lacking a strong local industry or the materials for one to develop naturally, Bulgaria resorted to promoting development via state directorates, controlling the distribution of resources, establishing strong protectionist laws and controlling the local financial sector. The first Prime Minister to fully dedicate himself towards economic development was Konstantin Stoilov - and his goals were ambitious. Seeing the industrial titans of Northwest Europe as an ideal, he declared that Bulgaria needs to one day become "a Belgium in the Balkans".\n\nIn spite of this, industrial development in Bulgaria has been insufficient, and the Balkan Wars completely disrupted it. Only the late 1920s saw an industrial boom start anew, and even it was meagre. In 1932, the People's Bloc government formed a board of Bulgaria's most esteemed economists, those who believed in an etatist economic system, at least, and drafted them to make a plan for a massive breakthrough industrialisation project.\n\nThis board included figures such as Todor Vladigerov, Konstantin Bobchev and the Historicism-influenced Bulgarian Economic Society. Though somewhat hesitant about full state intervention and calling for the need to include private initiative into the project, their draft is the most comprehensive document on the future of the Bulgarian economy by far - and has been accepted by the Ministry of National Economy as their guide.\n\nEnvisioning massive state-guided development in the fields of agriculture, industry, transportation and city design, it has rightfully been dubbed "The Great Etatist Project"."

Their plans are long and their ambitions are great - Zveno does not see itself as a yet another tinpot military clique nor as a mere National Populist dictatorship, their reformist goals are, if they are to be believed, of a unique Bulgarian direction. From their ivory tower in Sofia, Zveno envisions a thorough transformation of Bulgarian society, turning the nation into a clockwork machine. Irrational tradition will be uprooted, pointless distractions will be cleansed, little cracks and imperfections will be swept away, and a nation as efficient as an assembly line shall be built.\n\nAlready, however, tiny rifts are starting to form within the political circle. The faction of Zveno currently in charge, led by Kimon Georgiev and Damyan Velchev, see their ideology as a means to assume complete control of the state - overtaking even the Tsar himself, whom they see as a relic of the outdated past, and establishing a republic. This falls to direct opposition with the conservative wing of the circle, led by Pencho Zlatev, who are primarily composed of civilian politicians and outsider generals recruited to ensure the success of the conspiracy - their ambitions are nowhere near as totalitarian, and the Tsar still figures in their calculations.\n\nOne final factor to consider is the Union of Bulgarian National Legions, tentatively allied with Zveno and promoting their cause of political centralisation in civil society - sometimes with... rather violent means. Though they are of no threat right now, a great collapse of public legitimacy could lead to... something worrying."

Though Khan Kubrat and his successors did lay the foundations for the First Bulgarian Empire, they say, the Turkic-descended nomads eventually merged with the local Slavs to form the Bulgarian nation - which was, fundamentally, a Slavic one. This belief is not held by Dimitŭr Sŭsŭlov, a historian - or so he claims - who has long fought for a reimagining of the Bulgarian national identity. A lawyer by trade and a veteran of the Weltkrieg, he has gathered a small elitist circle of intellectuals and officers named the "Bulgarian Horde" to proliferate his ideas.\n\nAccording to Sŭsŭlov, Bulgarians are not Slavs, but rather a separate Indo-European branch which has played a key role in the history of Europe. The Bulgars, and their ancestors, the Huns, were not Turkic nor were they mere nomadic tribes - rather, they were the flagbearers of a long-forgotten civilisation that could challenge Rome in its height and ultimately settled in Bulgaria. Sŭsŭlov continues his works by stating that this legendary Hunnic origin requires Bulgaria to return to its roots - to grant full prerogatives to the King, do away with Western parliamentarism and create a traditional, absolute state.\n\nHis historic theories are fringe and denounced as pseudo-science by many - however, Sŭsŭlov's works find a home among the Bulgarian far-right."

Inspired by the success of the IMRO in Serbia, they have announced their presence as the Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation. Fighting the deplorable conditions of the Thracian Bulgarians, officially proposing a free Thracian state while really just seeking to reclaim these lands for Bulgaria, the ITRO stages terror bombings, assassinations, and village attacks without restraint."

However, there were politicians and philosophers, such as Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski and Ivan Meštrović, who included Bulgaria into the equation - and the activist officers composing Zveno hold some affinity towards the concept as well, although in a less... selfless light.\n\nKimon Georgiev, Damyan Velchev and their peers see Yugoslavism as the step forward for a truly Greater Bulgaria - by embracing Yugoslavism, it shall be able to paint its assimilationist tendencies in the Western provinces as merely seeking Yugoslav unity, and even use this as a banner to rally under for a challenge to Austrian hegemony."

Unlike their peers in the former Fatherland Front, the Syndicalists do not have a strong oppressive apparatus with which to maintain stability across the nation even in such a case of growing internal unrest - thus, an oppressive apparatus came to power.\n\nThe Federation of Anarchist Communists of Bulgaria, a Sorelian-inspired front for anarchist chetas organised in the Bulgarian mountains by Vasil Ikonomov, has taken advantage of the instability and seized power in Bulgaria in a swift stroke."

 bulgariaflavour.10.t:0 "The Third State Court"
 bulgariaflavour.10.d:0 "Established in 1880, the State Court, or Court of the State, is a non-permanent institution tasked to try large numbers of current or former government officials for egregious crimes committed against the state. Moribund for decades, it has now been revived with the publication of the Law on Punishment for the Perpetrators of the National Catastrophe. The Bulgarian nation demands someone to pay for the suffering it has endured during the Fourth Balkan War, someone who was responsible for the nation's inability to avert the catastrophe.\n\nThe Bulgarian army failed in battle during the war, and conservative army officers point to the wide-scale reforms initiated right before the war as the culprit. They say that the reforms of General Rusi Rusev proved inadequate in battle and only caused confusion in the military at a moment when tried and tested methods were necessary. Teodosi Daskalov, having commanded the armed forces during the war, is also likely to be imprisoned if the military-focused axis wins.\n\nAnother side claims that it was the civilian administration which brought Greater Bulgaria's undoing. Having grown decadent and corrupt over the interwar years, the politicians turned blind, unable to see Serbian and Romanian rearmament before it was far too late to react. Judges favouring this side call for a mass crackdown on dozens of opposition political figures and a full purge of the administration, even if it means our state economic sector, managed by these bureaucrats, will suffer greatly."

Thankfully, however, elections in Bulgaria no longer resemble the chaos of the parliamentary years, but are instead controlled and disciplined with the approving gaze of the Tsar. No parties are allowed to compete and only independent candidates have been allowed to stand for election, banded into pro-government and opposition camps.\n\nThe election has yielded an overwhelming majority for the supporters of the Tsar, and [BUL.GetLeader] has congratulated the returning cabinet with a stunning electoral victory."

 bulgariaflavour.12.d:0 "Riding from the north and sweeping across the mountains of the peninsula, numerous conquerors in the Balkans have tried to seize Constantinople and proclaim themselves as the new Emperor of the Romans - of them, few were as successful as Simeon the Great, who led the First Bulgarian Empire to its greatest territorial extent. Recognised as an "Emperor" by the Orthodox Church, he came close to seizing Constantinople itself and absorbing the Byzantine Empire, had it not been for his unfortunate death. Even today, he is still remembered as one of the most illustrious Tsars of Bulgaria, and the legacy of his claim upon Rome has not been forgotten.\n\nIt was one of Ferdinand I's dreams during the Balkan Wars - to seize Constantinople, unite the two coasts of the Bosphorus Strait, and restore the Byzantine Empire under Bulgarian shoulders. Though defeats in the Balkan War have tempered these ambitions, the Fourth Balkan War has reignited.\n\nFew could have imagined Bulgaria to be able to win the War so easily - in months, no, weeks, the Belgrade Pact has been completely vanquished, and the Ottoman Empire, foolishly expecting their stab in the back to succeed, has been driven behind the Sea of Marmara. The weakened, ageing, yet still ambitious Tsar has arrived to Constantinople for a victory parade - here, with the advice of his generals, he made a short speech, proclaiming that "what had been taken away from Simeon, he has restored". Today, Bulgaria shall no longer be a mere Tsardom. Today, it has asserted its claim to being an Empire."

 bulgariaflavour.13.t:0 "The Universal White Brotherhood"
 bulgariaflavour.13.d:0 "Founded by Petŭr Dŭnov after the Weltkrieg, the Universal White Brotherhood is a movement of occultist esoteric Christianity, and claims itself to be the successor to and unifier of "the three great traditions from the Bulgarian lands" - Ancient Greek Orphism cults, the work of Cyril and Methodius, and the Bogomilist movement. The "Universal Brotherhood" in its name is a sixth supranational race, which will be an organism of evolved human souls and extrasensory beings (angels) accomplished by studying the works and following the tenets of Dŭnov's teachings. Though it also has a racialist character, claiming that the souls of the white race, and specifically the Slavs, are the closest to reaching "the sixth race", it does not significantly pronounce these tenets.\n\nWhile the existence of such a pseudo-religious brotherhood would be of no concern to us, Nikola Nedev, one of the leading generals in the Bulgarian Army, is a personal friend of Dŭnov, and has been a member of the Universal White Brotherhood for a few years now. Recently, the General has been growing increasingly involved in the organisation, and has lapsed on his duties as General, which some say has had a negative effect on his ability to lead. Should we finally do something to curtail the growth of this Brotherhood, perhaps by getting city majors to refuse hosting for Dŭnov's speeches and getting Nedev to resign, or is this really not an issue?"

 bulgariaflavour.14.d:0 "Ferdinand I, Tsar of the Third Bulgarian Tsardom, has passed away at the age of 87 in the Royal Palace in Sofia. An active, if authoritarian monarch, Ferdinand has presided over the most tumultuous period in Bulgarian history, from the humble beginnings as a mere principality still under the Ottoman Empire, to a glorious rise until the eventual unification of all Bulgarian peoples in the Balkans. Though this hegemony over the Balkans eventually turned out to be not as durable as imagined, Ferdinand's accomplishments cannot be underestimated regardless. Whether you love him as the greatest ruler of Bulgaria since the Middle Ages or despise him as an autocrat, you have to recognise that his reign has left Bulgaria changed to its fundamentals.\n\nThe crown of Bulgaria has been inherited by his son Boris, a seamless transition, as the Crown Prince has fulfilled much of his father's duties for the past two decades. Boris III is expected to reign over a new era of Bulgarian history, as the world around it changes again, and its waves will surely pick up the Balkans as well."

 bulgariaflavour.15.t:0 "The Balkan Union"
 bulgariaflavour.15.d:0 "Much like in the rest of Europe, the nineteenth century was an age of nationalism in the Balkans, where Serbs, Bulgarians, Greeks, Albanians and others began dreaming of independent nation-states - and yet, albeit weak, a concept of a Balkan Federation always persisted. Sometimes it took a narrow form, limited to the South Slavs and thus entangled with the Yugoslav project, other times, such as in the original proposal by the Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, as a federation of all Balkan states. Sometimes it was proposed as a way to alleviate the ethnic tensions in the region, especially regarding the Macedonian question, other times it was seen as a way for Balkan peoples to collectively resist foreign aggression.\n\nBy the 1930s, a full federation is only limited to the socialist movement - however, concepts of Balkan integration still float about, and Bulgarian politicians such as Aleksandŭr Stamboliyski, Yanko Sakazov, and the Radical Democratic Party have spoken out in favour of it. The abandoned Serbian-Bulgarian Treaties of 1904 have served as a possible blueprint for economic and political Balkan integration - by abandoning trade barriers, establishing diplomatic cooperation and uniting to a military alliance, peace in the Balkans might still be possible.\n\nPerhaps one day, the Balkan states can still unite to one peaceful superpower. Until then, however, Bulgarian victory in the Fourth Balkan War should be enough to force the other Balkan states into cooperation."

 bulgariaflavour.17.d:0 "The formation of Yugoslavia has led to significant changes in the Bulgarian political spectrum, as the integration of the rest of the South Slavic lands has completely upended the nature of the state. The old 'Zveno' ('Unit') label, signifying the military clique's dedication to strength and rationality, has lost its lustre - after all, what better proof is there of the success of Zveno reforms than the fact that they have just defeated the Austrian Empire in battle?\n\nSupporters of the regime have begun to band under a new banner - the "United Yugoslavia" Political Circle, whose stated purpose is now the defence of "united Yugoslav national interest" against internal and external enemies alike. An official proclamation by the "Zveno" newspaper soon after the formation of Yugoslavia proclaimed the regime's approach to Yugoslavism - ripping a few pages from Integral Yugoslavist theory, the newspaper stated that cultural differences between Yugoslavs are a historical construct and a strong, centralised state is necessary to erase them. If unified not just physically, but spiritually, "the Yugoslavs" may become the flagbearers of a new great power in Europe, or at least a power capable to resist France, Germany and Russia alike.\n\n"United Yugoslavia" has attempted to reach out to Serbian and Illyrian intellectuals, as well as politicians, to recruit them to the administration, with little success. From start to finish, the Yugoslavist project will inevitably be a Bulgarian supremacist project - and while Bulgarian military might will certainly retain this construct for a decade or two, how long can millions of Serbs and Croats be controlled by sheer force alone?"

 bulgariaflavour.18.d:0 "The beginning of the Great Etatist Project has attracted criticism from foreign and domestic economists alike. In their eyes, such an escalation of state intervention in the economy will only destabilise it, and the idea tha it could possibly turn Bulgaria into a modern industrial power is ridiculous. These critics have received a harsh response from the University of Sofia, however, whose longtime professor of political economy, Aleksandŭr Tsankov, is a noted supporter of the Great Etatist Project.\n\nThough Tsankov was not a member of the economist board tasked to draft the plans for the project, he has been involved in state economic institutions in the past, most notably in the Directorate for Economic Care and Public Foresight during the Weltkrieg. Though Tsankov acknowledges some problems with the wartime directorate's work, he writes in his response article that a return to free-market economics would be ridiculous. To him, free-market capitalists are ideologues of economic systems that have outlived their time.\n\nTsankov finishes his article by responding to another common critique - that the Project is socialist - by stating that this is no cause of concern, as "socialism must by necessity become a little bourgeois, and the bourgeoisie - a little socialist"."

 bulgariaflavour.19.d:0 "When the State Protection Act was adopted, it was not merely the minority communities or underground socialists who suffered. Free speech has been curtailed and Bulgarian literature has struggled since. While the Republican Revolution in Serbia led to an explosive revival of avant-garde art and literature, such as the Zenitist movement, Bulgarian literature has increasingly struggled to breathe. The government of Konstantin Georgiev, as well as subsequent governments, looked down on Symbolist, Expressionist or even the unique Diabolist currents, and instead cooperated with the Zlatorog magazine, edited by Vladimir Vasilev, who was much more cooperative with creeping authoritarianism.\n\nThe Bulgarian literary community has endorsed the designs of the Petorka, joining the campaign against the State Protection Act and against the censorship of literature. The poet, journalist and translator Geo Milev stands at the forefront of this literary movement. Milev was a socialist in his youth, dedicating poems to the French Revolution and to the struggle of Bulgarian communists, but he matured and moderated over time - still, however, he is a noted progressive and a supporter of the Broad Socialists. The Petorka's campaign against the Act has revived one of Milev's poems from 1926, in which he challenged the still rather recent Act:\n\n"To be able to suffocate the proud consciousness, the voice that cries out, the eternal truth that lives forever - everyone discovered a single ax - today's rulers of Bulgaria invented the "State Protection Act", to kill everything that cannot die!""
