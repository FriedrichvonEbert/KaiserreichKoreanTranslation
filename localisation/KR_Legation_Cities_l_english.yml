 LEC_FRANCIS_FESTING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 28th, 1902\nDublin, United Kingdom\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nGraduated from Sandhurst in 1921. Festing was looking at a promising career in the British Indian Army or at Eastern Command, having served as Aide-de-Camp to John Burnett-Stuart, former General Officer Commanding, Madras District right up until the even of the revolution. Now like most of the British officer corps who lacked a Syndicalist bent he finds himself drifting between the old colonies. Lacking the budget to commission him the Empire elected not have him continue service in any of the extant dominions and thus he has wound up living with old army chums in Shanghai, where there's nobody to tell you to stop wearing the old uniform and a good chance of a stiff gin in the morning."
 LEC_WILLIAM_FAIRBAIRN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 28th, 1885\nRickmansworth, United Kingdom\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA former Royal Marine and police officer in one of Shanghai's red light districts, William Ewart Fairbairn is most notable for his frankly frightening collection of scars accumulated from hundreds of street fights in the line of duty and for organising the SMP's specialist anti-riot squad. Known as "Dangerous Dan" Fairbairn is a master of boxing, wrestling, savate, jiujutsu, judo and kung fu, which he has used to develop his own style of combat known as Defendu. According to police records he has over 500 confirmed non-training fights both armed and unarmed under his belt, as well as a custom-made bullet-proof vest designed to stop bullets from a 7.63×25mm Mauser. He now spends most of his time encouraging other members of the Volunteer Corps to remember the basics of CQC."
 LEC_REGINALD_TYRWHITT_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 10th, 1870\nOxford, United Kingdom\n§YNaval Career:§L\nEnrolled as a cadet on the HMS Britannia in 1883, Sir Reginal Yorke Tyrwhitt rose through the ranks and eventually served during the Weltkrieg as commander of the Harwich Force, the squadron which fired the first shots of the war in 1914. Its most famous action under Tyrwhitt's command was the Cuxhaven raid, where sea-planes played a key role in attacking a German port from the air and escaping with no casualties. Tyrwhitt's only major blemish is his commendation of Captain John Knowles Im Thurn prior to his mismanagement causing the Plymouth Riots in 1925. Holding the position of Commander-in-Chief, China, in 1926 during the Northern Expedition Tyrwhitt is at least partially responsible for the evacuation of British forces to Australia and the subsequent "protection" of Hong Kong by the Germans, an act for which he has never quite been forgiven by his fellow Britons."

Shanghai's reach goes beyond her limits, and beyond the thirty mile "neutral zone" that has become a haven for criminals, all the way up the Yangtze in a sprawling path of railroads, factories and telegraph lines that forms the beating heart of Chinese industry. Money comes and goes like water in the cities at all levels of society.\n\nTo the north Tianjin is the world's entrepôt for Beijing and a thriving hub of railway speculation for all of China, to the south is old Hong Kong: a last guttering ember of British glory kept alive by her fine harbour and access to southern China. At the beating heart of it all lies Shanghai, a diamond plucked from the hands of China and polished to a mirror shine. The Paris of the East is in its heyday, the streets hum with electricity, the opium dens curl with mysterious smoke and the westerners spend money like it is going out of fashion and make it just as fast.\n\nAll of course, is not as it appears.

Now that Transamur no longer disputes our claims to be the one true Russia, however, the Chair has decided to call for a vote on whether or not to restore our rights.

Over this time, they became closely allied with the Germans and the AOG, which provided the Clique with much wealth but also was its undoing.

Meanwhile, Hunan and the Federalists in Liangguang have abandoned the League, hoping to wait out the storm and strike at an opportunity. To many, it seems that the Zhili order is failing.

City commissioners vehemently objected to this decision, as well as many bureaucrats, but the ambassadors have left the Council chamber and returned to their own residences, guarded by national troops.

Now that the eastern [TRM.GetNameDef] is indisputably the only Russia remaining which has any interest in maintaining its position in Tianjin, however, the ambassador from Vladivostok has urged us to restore voting rights to his government.\n\nSince this is quite a substantive matter, it is technically supposed to go through the Legation Council.

Pabst and starring superstars such as Christl Mardayn, Louis Jouvet, and Raymond Rouleau, the film depicts an exiled French aristocrat (played by Christl Mardayn) working as a cabaret singer in Shanghai to support her daughter’s education. Adapted from a novel by Oscar Paul Gilbert, critics have noticed that the film is a commentary of China’s fractious and political state while also highlighting the hedonistic lifestyle of European expatriates and exiles crammed in Shanghai’s international quarters. The main protagonist’s exiled background serves as a reminder of the exiled Britons and Frenchmen in Asia, with their countries fallen to syndicalism. The film also highlights the crime and glory of the Shanghai nightlife featuring a mysterious and conspirational organisation called the Black Dragon, which follows a charismatic and nationalistic leader named Cheng, who is determined to drive out westerners and foreign influence China.\n\n Unlike most films centred on Asian themes, the Shanghai Drama boasts an impressive cast of Asians since much of the filming was done beyond Shanghai’s international settlement. Regardless of the film’s political undertones, it is considered a box office success, with critics praising Mardayn’s performance and Pabst’s filmography."

Popular items amongst fans of dacai include borscht without beets, baked lasagna with cheese, and deep-fried pork chops with Worcestershire sauce and beef burgundy. In addition to the western dishes, traditional Chinese food serves as a replacement, such as Chinese wine in the absence of western wine or shark fin soup.

The film holds allusions to the national struggles plaguing China, including modernisation issues and the disruption of national unity.\n\nThe film stars the popular Chinese actor Zhao Dan and the iconic singer Zhou Xuan (famous for songs such as Blooming Flowers Full Moon) and is set in the slums of old Shanghai. Xiao Chen (played by Zhao Dan), a trumpet player, falls in love with the singer Xiao Hong (played by Zhou Xuan), an immigrant from the Fengtian Government in Manchuria, and her older sister Xiao Yun. Xiao Yun is forced into prostitution to make a living while Xiao Hong works as a singer at a teahouse. After a misunderstanding that gives the impression that Xiao Hong is unfaithful, Xiao Chen discovers she and her sister are to be sold off to a wealthy gangster named Mr. Gu. The legal fees to stop the transaction are too much for Xiao Chen, so he and the girls attempt to flee Gu’s grasp. While Xiao Hong manages to escape, Xiao Yun is caught by Gu but refuses to reveal her sister’s whereabouts. In a violent confrontation with Gu, she is fatally wounded, but by the time her friends and sister return, they can do nothing; they are simply too poor to afford a doctor.\n\nThe film’s telling and powerful depiction of social disparity is an open critique of the corruption and poverty caused by Shanghai’s colonialist state.

Well known all throughout China due to the box office successes from Shanghai and her silent acting ability, word has it that over 100,000 people will be attending her funeral in Shanghai.\n\n Born to a working-class family in Shanghai without much of a father figure, Ruan spent her early life working as a housemaid with her mother. In 1926, to help make ends meet, she signed up for the prominent Mingxing Film Company and made her first film at 16. However, her first real break came in Spring Dream of an Old Capital in 1930, which was a massive hit throughout China. She continued to play leading roles in other popular hits such as Love and Duty (1931), Little Toys (1933), and The Goddess (1934). However, with the arrival of actual “talkies” in China (films featuring voice instead of silent acting), her popularity began to erode. Her tumultuous private life was exploited heavily by tabloids and gossip, and her divorce from her husband became one of vindictive coverage. At the age of 28, she has committed suicide with an overdose of barbiturates - her suicide note only declaring that “a gossip is a fearful event.” Needless to say, her death has significantly impacted the people of China, who were enamoured with her skilful acting and charisma.

A harsh critique of life in Hong Kong, the book portrays the wealth disparity between the local Chinese and the wealthy westerners.\n The author is the 23-year-old Zhang Ying, a Chinese woman of aristocratic lineage and educated bilingually. Born in Shanghai in 1920, Ying, better known as Eileen Chang, lived a life of comfort. However, arguments and bickering were frequent in the Ying household due to her father’s opium addiction and extramarital affairs. After her mother returned from France to study, Chang was exposed to the literary works of the French writer “George Sand” (Amantine Dupin), the famous French feminist who had a profound impact on Chang. In 1939, Chang was accepted to the University of London in the Union of Britain for an academic scholarship. Still, due to the war in Europe, she decided to study in Hong Kong instead. And thus, in a time of uncertainty, disorder, and war in China, Chang moves between Shanghai and Hong Kong.\n\n Much of her writing has to do with life in the Legation Cities. Her first book, “Love in a Sinful City,” is set in her contemporary Hong Kong and Shanghai and deals with life in the Legation Cities in a period of uncertainty. As the war rages on in Europe, resources are becoming increasingly scarce in the Legation Cities, and tensions are emerging regarding the unequal relationship between the wealthy westerners and the local population. According to critics, her writing has illustrated what life was for the ordinary Chinese people and how life persisted despite the severe inequalities and the stress of being at war. Her latest book, “The Golden Cangue,” features stirring metaphors such as the moon, familial hierarchy, cangues, and footbinding to illustrate the decadence of the idle rich in Shanghai. Given her young age, critics have also remarked that her literary maturity seems beyond her. Her works written in the Chinese vernacular have also been translated into English, attracting her fans in the English-speaking world."

Mulan turns down an offer to serve in the imperial court and instead goes home, reverting back to her feminine persona. She marries Yuandu and the two live happily ever after.\n Written and produced despite the censorship laws of the Japanese, the film is full of subtle patriotic themes and has become extremely popular among the local Chinese. The character of Mulan has been compared to the leader Song Qingling and its talks of fighting against barbarians has resonated deeply within the local Chinese."

 lec.155.d:0 "The Open Door policy that kept peace and order between the ambitious western nations and Japan in China has finally ended. With tensions in the world rising due to the events in Europe and Asia, the inevitability of conflict arriving on the Asian continent has led the Legation Cities to join the [LEC.GetFactionName]  faction in a great break from the traditional non-alignment of the cities. This places the treaty ports firmly in the [LEC.GetFactionName] sphere of influence, the Legation Mandate has ended with the nations of the international alliances withdrawing their troops and ambassadors from the Legation Cities. Businesses scramble as this effectively places the treat ports under the economic sphere of the [LEC.GetFactionName]. While this marks an end of an era, this may also lead to unforeseen consequences as now all bets are off, and the Legation Cities are open to foreign aggression or perhaps even demands from the Chinese."

At the head of this alliance is crime lord Du Yuesheng, better known as "Big Ears Du".\n\nYuesheng's iron grip on the opium trade out of Shanghai is long established, and with the establishment of the Legation Cities the route has been opened for him and the Green Gang to muscle in on Hong Kong. The triad gangsters who thrive in the Chinese districts of Hong Kong have pushed back strongly against this attempt, culminating in a clash today between them and Green Gang men at a pleasure house in Hong Kong. Reportedly at least fifty people were involved in an armed clash with machetes, knives and pistols before the police were able to break it up. This has only served to highlight the ongoing problem of criminality in the cities and its potentially destabilising effect."

After his bodyguards and companion were shot he was subsequently torn apart with axes in an act of mob violence.

Our files tell us the following: Du Yuesheng was born in a poor Chinese village in what is now the neutral zone in 1888, at the age of just four his mother had died in childbirth, his father was dead and his sister sold into slavery. He returned to his village to live with his grandmother. Returning to Shanghai at the age of fourteen he worked at a fruit stall until he was fired for theft, whereupon a job as a bouncer at a brothel brought him into contact with the Green Gang. From there he was introduced to Huang Jinrong, the highest ranked Chinese detective in the former French, now German, concession of Shanghai. Jinrong's wife saw potential in the boy and had him assist on a number of large opium deals, gradually expanding his remit and network of contacts, as well as his wealth. \nIn 1924 when Lu Yongxiang, then in control of most of Shanghai, had Huang Jinrong locked up for publicly beating his son Du found himself filling his shoes and in control of most of the German Concession's criminal enterprises. While Jinrong was released thanks in part to the Green Gang's close relationship with Zhejiang warlord Du would forever more be the most prominent Shanghai gangster. \nDu is colloquially known as "Big Ears Du" for obvious reasons and has an outgoing and gregarious personality, generous to friends but ruthless to foes. The leader of several legitimate businesses, a few of which aren't fronts for illegal dealings, Du is also the head of the Association of Chinese Tax Payers, sits on the board of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and is the sponsor of at least one major temple in Shanghai."

Our files tell us the following:Huang Jinrong has been a perennial feature in the Shanghai underworld since 1892, when he joined the police force of the French Concession at the age of 24. Retained and promoted due to his skills as a sleuth, a lack of competent administrators eventually lead the Germans to appoint him Chief of Police in their new concession after the French were removed. Adapting smoothly to his new role the only hiccup came when he was imprisoned illegally for beating Lu Yongxiang's son, which saw Du Yuesheng rise to prominence as the foremost member of the Green Gang in the concession and placed Huang in his debt. \nJinrong is for his part a patient man, seemingly preferring to let the younger Du run the show while he enjoys the vast wealth being his loyal second-in-command brings him. His ex-wife Lin Guisheng was said to be the true brains and ambition behind many of his operations, however in the aftermath of the formation of the International Mandate Jinrong expertly saw that the Green Gang in the German Concession became the dominant group in all of Shanghai, so there must be more to him than just a vast address book."

Born in Zhejiang province right on the outskirts of Shanghai and a graduate of the province's military academy, Xiaolin came to Shanghai in 1912 already well-connected with the provincial warlords that surrounded the city. From there he put those connections to use, working then under Huang Jinrong. With the help of the warlord armies the gang secured control over the trade routes running down the Yangtze river and gained a stranglehold on the city's opium trade. \nWhile he might be key to their prominence, Zhang Xiaolin was passed over by Huang Jinrong and Lin Guisheng for the honour of taking over the most prominent role as head of the Green Gang, a fact Zhang has always resented. As a result of his resentment a growing rift is noted between him and Du Yuesheng, who further distrusts Zhang for his violent nature and the lurid tales about how he treats those who cross him. It may only be a matter of time before the split becomes official, and either Xiaolin or Yuesheng has to go..."

We could easily earmark him as our candidate for High Commissioner of the Legation Cities, and thus find a way to make him accept his removal and replacement by Mark Aitchison Young, a more loyal civil servant currently stationed in the West Indies Federation.

 lecbrits.20.d:0 "Our agents have emerged from Governor Smith's house with startling news: the British are trying to both take back Hong Kong for the Crown and reclaim their voting rights on the Legation Council. These would drastically change the status quo of the Legation Cities and Hong Kong, radical changes that Governor Smith would prefer to avoid. He has assured our investigators and the Commissioner that he would be willing to obfuscate British plans to reconquer Hong Kong, if necessary, though he expects a healthy stipend in return."

 lecbrits.25.d:0 "The Australasian Confederation has been ruled by the authoritarian hand of Governor-General Birdwood for twelve years. Now, however, it seems that the Crown has granted leave for new elections to be held. It is unlikely that radicals, even if elected, will be allowed to remain long, and so this news has bought the British some support in the Cities."

 lecbrits.26.d:0 "Canberra has been organising the British in our territory with a view of retaking Hong Kong or reclaiming the British voting rights.

High Commissioner [LEC.GetLeader] and several other ambassadors and representatives to the Legation Council stood at the end of the dock to meet him. After some brief formalities, the Prince and his entourage got in a taxicab and drove quickly to the Peninsula Hong Kong hotel, citing his daughter's seasickness as the reason for the hasty departure. It is anticipated that he will have several meetings with important British officials and businessmen in Hong Kong throughout the month-long stay, as well as some tours about the city and its outskirts. Given the Prince's dislike for large public gatherings, however, it is unlikely that he will advertise these outings much."

 lecbrits.30.d:0 "Today, a thousand volunteers from across the British Empire in Asia arrived in Hong Kong to sign up for the defence force. Many of them were officers in Australasia, India, and Malaya, so they received officer commissions for the defence force as well. Unfortunately, both their presence within the defence force and the ceremony that accompanied the new recruits has lead to an up-tick in British patriotism and allegiance in Hong Kong."

 lecbrits.32.d:0 "The British have appeared to have mustered everything they could in the Legation Cities for an operation to reoccupy Hong Kong. Earlier today, a flotilla from the Royal Navy entered Victoria Harbour demanding that the governor of Hong Kong meet with the British at the Peninsula Hotel to discuss the “restoration of order” and immediate return of the former Crown Colony. No troops have disembarked from their ships, stopping this from becoming a full invasion. Still, it would appear that the situation is quite dire. We can, however, refuse their negotiations and ask the governor to hold out for a bit longer until we can bring reinforcements."

Now we have an opportunity to rectify that mistake, and the British lobby has been pressuring us to grant them their rights back.

We were never even granted any voting rights on the Legation Council, even though our concessions were the most numerous. Now, though, it seems the Legation Council has rectified their mistake.

 lecjapfeud.1.d:0 "For the most part, the buzzing streets of Tianjin have been spared from the turmoil that has afflicted the rest of China. While anything but calm, this Paris of the Orient has been more accustomed to fireworks than the battles-scarred cities to the west. Today however, the citizens of the city had their daily affairs interrupted as they were treated to a taste of the region's conflicts right at their doorstep.\n\nIt quickly became evident that this was no ordinary heist or criminal dispute as shots were exchanged in a busy street crossing near the diplomatic quarters. Four groups of men in suits, numbering about a dozen total, were exchanging fire before taking off. They managed to escape by mixing in with the panicked crowds, successfully using the general chaos of the situation to evade law enforcement. Two of the criminals were left dead on the ground, and with nothing to tie anyone to a motive or an organisation for the time being the police are left struggling to solve this one. Although an embarrassment for the Tianjin police department, the chief of police has ordered an increase in police presence in the area to root out the gangsters. At the very least, we should be thankful that no innocent people were injured in the crossfire."
 lecjapfeud.1.a:0 "Catch those crooks!"
 lecjapfeud.2.t:0 "Escalation of Sectional Disputes"
 lecjapfeud.2.d:0 "Mere days after the last skirmish, Tianjin was rocked again by another gun battle, this time within the diplomatic quarters itself. Luckily, the increased police presence prevented a repeat of the last public shooting. Their findings in its aftermath are, however, quite alarming.\n\nOnce more, the criminals had gathered in a similar fashion. Only this time, the Tianjin Police Department were able to both observe them before the crime and intervene as things went south. Two gangsters met one-another outside of a cafe and spoke to one another, exchanged a briefcase, and were then assaulted by a group of six men armed with revolvers, seemingly vying for whatever was in the suitcase. What followed almost seemed like it would be more befitting of a crime flick than real life as the stick-up was met by half four armed crooks on either side of them opening fire at the presumptive thieves as they realised all too late that their victims weren't alone. Even worse for all of them, the police were quick to intervene before any further tragedies could be had, and luckily enough all men gave up the moment they realised that they couldn't fight their way past half of Tianjin's police force. While most were tight-lipped about it, the contents of the briefcase gave away that the men are hired guns from local Triads acting as middlemen in a larger dispute, although the contents of the briefcase didn't give away who or what right away. After the suspects were subjected to lengthy interrogations, however, one eventually snapped and ratted them all out. They were acting on behalf of the Japanese embassy, but it gets more convoluted from there on. One group were acting on behalf of the navy attaché, another group from the colonial office, and yet another acting for the Japanese foreign affairs department. We suspect that more departments of the Japanese may be involved as well, but we have no concrete proof at the time being.\n\nThe fact the Japanese have factional disputes is not news to us, but it hasn't gotten this bad in public before. Now comes the difficult choice in deciding how to deal with this situation. We could intervene directly into the matter, although we should be mindful that doing so could open a bigger can of worms than simply letting this factional dispute die down on its own would."

Various officers in the police force have come forward, but they all seem to fall on two sides of the same debate. There are the ones that want an official intervention through public channels, and another group that insists that keeping things out of the public eye is essential. During the discussions, both sides made salient points. The prior put an emphasis on adherence to rules and that matters of this importance should be handled professionally and that not doing so would be tantamount to 'stooping to their level'. The other side countered by leaning in on practicality and the better chance of success if things are handled with discretion, noting that the Japanese factions involved are likely to merely dig in their heels if publicly pressured.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the decision was made to..."

After several weeks of trying, it's likely that continuing with this approach won't yield any different results either.\n\nAfter this fiasco, most seem ready to cut their losses and drop the issue, albeit reluctantly. A small but vocal contingent insists, however, that if they're insistent on hiding their activities then there most be a good reason for it, urging that we investigate them in secret."

Needless to say, we ought to consider our choices carefully as we can't afford another blunder. Our first option is to hire Huang Jinrong, a Chinese detective with underground ties that has worked with the council in the past. Our past working relation coupled with him not harbouring any political biases for or against the Japanese makes him an obvious choice to some. His ties to the underground can, however, be seen as a double-edged sword if we're unlucky.\n\nIn the light of these concerns, some say that it would be more prudent to go for someone with a cleaner record. They have suggested the expertise of both American and German investigation bureau's operating in the region. While they have outstanding track records and are likely to thoroughly and professionally investigate the matter, their expertise lies more in white collar crime and may therefore be less suited for dealing with the Triads. There is also the matter of potential political biases, which we also need to consider. We only have one shot at getting to the bottom of this, so we have to make this investigation count."

After a long period of radio silence he's finally contacted us again only to inform us that he's managed to turn up nothing but dead ends. While the long period without results has no doubt been as frustrating to him, he insists that the trial has gone cold, likely due to the amount of heat that the last fight and the public humiliation brought on by our publicly applied pressure. While a conclusive end to the investigation seems unlikely at this point, if what he says is true it should at least mean that we're not going to see any further escalations on this matter. Be that as it may, the investigation continues."

The suspicion was raised when he seemed to deliberately and repeatedly omitted details in his recent reports which the Tianjin police knew to be the case. Because of this, the investigation is now turning around towards the supposed investigator himself with the Tianjin police department already on the case.\n\nIt may not have gone as planned, we have at least found our crook and been able to start shutting down the Triad activity tied to this case. If nothing else, the investigation has managed to direct the heat against the Chinese criminal interests in the cities. This should also push the Japanese fighting behind the scenes, at least for now, as their alleged Triad contacts are feeling the heat."

Lothar Eisenträger, a major German figure in the legations, has been implicated in this affair. Having had ties to the Japanese businesses that were financially tied to the disputes, the eyes of the law enforcement are now on him and the illicit financial activities he was tied to. As an added bonus, the heat being brought down on these business ties seems to have forced the Japanese factions to settle their disputes behind the scenes rather than on the streets."

Although under the control of the Japanese Consulate, the China Agency would be an obvious choice as it would provide a direct and discreet channel of communications with the Japanese. Some claim, however, that approaching them would mean that we'd be dealing on Japanese terms. Although unorthodox, they suggest that going through the Triads using the leads we got from our earlier investigations. Going through them, we could be able to put more direct pressure on the Japanese in our dealings with them as they have relied on these Triads to do their inter-factional dirty work for now."

Our options, based on the information we got from the arrests that the police made earlier, seem to be either Du Yuesheng or Zhang Xiaolin. Du is lower on the rung and has a notable role in the red light scene in Shanghai. Allegedly, some of the hired guns answer to him. Zhang on the other hand is probably the largest crime boss active in the Legations. Anything that could be tied to the Japanese involvement has likely passed through him at some point."

The fighting reached a fever pitch in recent days, and only the arrival of more police from other parts of the Legations seem to have had a marginal calming effect on things. Their investigators seem to believe, however, that a more likely reason for the gradual decrease in violence is because one of the factions is close to winning."

The fact that the Japanese military, navy, colonial department and foreign ministries have severe differences is no secret, but through a series of difficult negotiations we've managed to help resolve their disputes behind the scenes. With the conflict defused, business as usual soon returned to the cities.\n\nAlthough some are unhappy with this development as it means that the infighting that put a cap on the growth of Japanese influence has diminished thanks to this new inter-agency cooperation and bolstered role of the China Agency, most are just happy that further tragedy was averted."

The 1936 election has borne a strange result, the election of the Progressive Floyd Olson on a National Unity ticket. It would seem that, hoping to preserve American democracy, the Republican and Democratic Parties have temporarily united to defeat the radical threat. While the National Unity Party’s overriding focus is internal stability and not diplomacy or power projection, that very focus has convinced many investors in the Cities that the Americans will remain a stabilising presence for years to come."

 lecyankded.9.long:0 "It seems that the new president of the United States, [USA.GetLeader], has pacified the socialists and associated unions and strikers in the north. Enraged with these actions, the rightist radical Huey Long has risen up in the South, though unlike the last time the South rebelled he has declared he has no intention of seceding, but instead intends to restore 'rightful American values' to the nation.

 lecyankded.11.d:0 "As many have anticipated since the crisis in American politics began, the United States have fallen into civil war yet again. This has created a power vacuum in the Far East, as America was one of the strongest proponents of the status quo, and its embodiment in the Legation Cities. With them temporarily out of the picture, the very fundamental nature of the Cities will undoubtedly change radically. The first thing to be decided by the Council is what the new voting arrangements for America are, and more importantly which America we are to recognise. If the American voting rights are removed, it is likely that a new High Commissioner will then be elected by the Council. What is sure is that these will be uncertain times for the Mandate."

 lecyankded.13.d:0 "The only change in leadership in the Legation Council’s short history has been the replacement of Stirling Fessenden with his chosen successor, Nelson Johnson. Then, in the heyday of the Cities in 1932, there was no doubt in any ambassador’s mind that a continued American presence was needed, and the transfer of power was smooth. Now, however, with the American civil war raging, the American China Marines withdrawing from Shanghai, and China in chaos, things are different.\n\nWith the invocation of Article 14, High Commissioner Johnson has chosen to step down temporarily, in order to ensure a fair vote. The Council then unanimously voted in Erwin von Zach, the Austro-Hungarian delegate, as the temporary High Commissioner, and the politicking began. The Germans and Japanese delegations, each of which were receiving constant communications from their government instructing them to secure the post of High Commissioner, argued constantly that their opposite number and America were both incapable of protecting the consular powers interests in the Far East, and that only their nation could successfully keep the peace.\n\nThough the American ambassador at a critical time to his country’s fate, Mr Johnson himself appeared quite worn out, and the voice of America in the chamber was mostly provided by Patrick Hurley, the current Deputy Commissioner. He argued that the United States was sure to emerge from the civil war even stronger than before, and that they would surely come to Shanghai’s aid at any time. This notion was almost universally derided throughout the Council, and Pyotr Tiedemann, the Russian representative, was heard to mutter to his neighbour that ‘the Americans are a spent force in Asia forever.’\n\nAny effect the surprise of proffering his own nation as a dark horse candidate might have provided was soon robbed of him, as the British ambassador rose to speak. He dealt eloquently with the American conflict, and Mr Johnson was seen to give his first weary smile of the session. Acting-Administrator Smith also dealt ably with the Japanese and German ambassador’s criticisms of his home country’s status on the Council. Who better, he argued, to preside over the Council than a member with no vote? This was met with quiet consternation from the German and Japanese delegations, but Mr Hurley was seen speaking to Acting-Administrator Smith as the Council adjourned. After dinner, Ambassador von Zach motioned for a vote, and the ambassadors took their seat once more. In the end, it seems the Council believed..."

The Legation Council had to vote on a new High Commissioner to lead the Mandate into the future, and it seems they have chosen for the incumbent American High Commissioner, [LEC.GetLeader], to stay in the role.

While the civil war’s eventual victor would be well placed to claim their voting rights on the Council, recognising one faction or another would surely lead to international condemnation, as we could hardly satisfy every power and their desires. Helpfully, we have an easy precedent to follow to our north, where both Vladivostok and Moscow claim the title of the true Russia, and as such Russia’s seat on the council.

Huang Jinrong is the obvious choice to lead the crackdown but his criminal connections could compromise the status of the council. While the Chamber of Commerce has put itself forward as a more 'moral' alternative, many commissioners doubt their capabilities."
 lectianjap.12.a:0 "Huang Jinrong will lead the crackdown."
 lectianjap.12.b:0 "The Chamber of Commerce is a more palatable choice."
 lectianjap.13.t:0 "The Crackdown Succeeds!"
 lectianjap.13.d:0 "Good news has reached Shanghai! The crackdown against the China Agency has went exceptionally well despite the best attempts by the Japanese to obstruct us. With the China Agency defanged and its operations limited solely to its more legal avenues we have removed one of the larger thorns in our side. While the Japanese are internally seething, there is little they can do now."

 lectianjap.14.t:0 "The Crackdown Fails!"
 lectianjap.14.d:0 "Terrible news has reached Shanghai! The crackdown against the China Agency has gone horribly wrong! The organisation was able to successfully hide in the deep underbellies of the city and obscure its more illegal operations. While this will have little short-term effect, in the long term Japan will be able to regroup and bolster their operations."
 lectianjap.14.a:0 "Well that's not good..."
 lectianjap.15.t:0 "Help From The Green Gang"
 lectianjap.15.d:0 "While it is unfortunate we have to ask for help from common gangsters, with the Japanese proving unwilling to cooperate, we have had to turn to less than orthodox means. By offering to turn a few blind eyes, The Green Gang has agreed to do some investigation work for us and has come to the conclusion that the Japanese are using the China Agency to funnel arms to their contacts in the Chinese interior with the Legation Cities as the smuggling point. While this evidence is flimsy at best we could use it as a prerogative for a more... official investigation."
 lectianjap.15.a:0 "This could prove very interesting..."
 lectianjap.18.t:0 "Shanghai Says Yes!"
 lectianjap.18.d:0 "Great news from Shanghai, the Mandate has agreed to give us a green light to further operations in Tianjin. It seems that their economic woes were just too much to maintain security in the city.

 lectianjap.19.t:0 "Japanese Troops Garrison Tianjin"
 lectianjap.19.d:0 "It seems that economic woes have gone down hard on the Legation Cities and they have decided to outsource much of their security operations to the Japanese to keep their economy afloat. While there is little we can do to stop them, there has been uproar in the council over the shifting balance of power and with calls for Japan to not abuse their position in the city."
 lectianjap.19.a:0 "Worrying, to say the least."
 lectianjap.20.t:0 "Shanghai Refuses!"
 lectianjap.20.d:0 "Terrible news has come out of Shanghai! The International Council has refused to give us a green light to further expand military operations! This is a major blow to our plans to take over Tianjin and we will now have to wait for the China Agency to orchestrate more attacks before we can make our demands again."

 lectianjap.21.d:0 "Earlier today an explosive device was detonated in the port city of Tianjin, killing scores of civilians and wounding many more. The police have claimed that this is simply a case of the anti-concessionist violence though the native Chinese are adamant that 'dark forces' are at work, with some wondering if this has any relation to our recent involvement of Tianjin. Obviously the military has claimed it has nothing to do with them."

 lectianjap.22.d:0 "Members of the Japanese delegation have petitioned the mandate to grant Japan a green light to begin security operations in Tianjin.

While the Japanese have court-martialled the officer and are attempting to distance themselves from the plot, this serves as a politically embarrassing incident."
 lectianjap.23.a:0 "Hurray!"
 lectianjap.24.t:0 "The Germans Return"
 lectianjap.24.d:0 "The German investigation returned with little luck, having apprehended only a few of the typical miscreants, none of which had shown any initiative or intelligence to construct the bomb and plan out such an attack. After successive interrogations the men were released and we find ourselves with no leads or clues. The Germans have admitted that their 'sources' have failed and promise they'll catch them next time."

 lectianjap.25.d:0 "The Legation Council has gone bankrupt, spelling an end to the International Mandate. Now, as Shanghai devolves into street fights and chaos, the outlying cities of the Mandate are left unprotected. In Tianjin, rioters and gangs have mostly been suppressed, and the city police are slowly regaining control, aided by our troops and prominent Triads, all of whom are trying to secure the city for one faction or another.\n\nThere is not much time before Beijing hears the news, and they are almost guaranteed to try and take the city if they can. We have one opportunity to secure the city for ourselves before they can mobilise - should we take it?"

 lectianjap.29.d:0 "The Japanese have recently occupied Tianjin, and have been deliberating the fate of the city. Happily for us, they have decided to restore the city’s administration to the rightful Chinese government, and our troops have already moved into the city. This is a great day for all Chinese!"

 lectianjap.30.t:0 "The Occupation of Tianjin"
 lectianjap.30.d:0 "With pro-Japanese forces having gained control of the Legation Council, they are now beginning to exert their influence. The Legation Council has not only recognised us, they have invited our troops into Tianjin to "secure the city" from the threat of the hostile illegitimate Chinese government. Though our troops can now enter the city and we effectively administer much of the city, most of the profits Tianjin generates still go to Shanghai."

This is one of the first times Xiaolin has attempted an independent operation in a different city from Shanghai, and this operation could reveal his style of conducting a gang. What will he order his men to do?"

Xiaolin's men, intercepted by the rival gang, opened fire almost immediately, killing several and wounding many more. While they are a step closer to securing the dockyards of Fuzhou, their reputation has suffered."

 lecfuzhou.3.t:0 "Heroin Production Goes Local"
 lecfuzhou.3.d:0 "Zhang Xiaolin, an important member of the Green Gang, has created a domestic Fuzhouan heroin production, making it unnecessary for him to smuggle the heroin from Shanghai, thus making his operations far more secure than they are currently."

 lecfuzhou.5.d:0 "The Green Gang has taken over much of the shipping in Fuzhou, especially of the smuggling of drugs, with them finally being able to push out more smaller local Triads.

 lecfuzhou.5.a:0 "They better leave legal shipping alone!"
 lecfuzhou.6.t:0 "Drugs Proliferating"
 lecfuzhou.6.d:0 "Drugs have become more and more common in Fuzhou, with the police being unable to stop the spread of them, with the most popular drugs being opium and heroin. Many of the new drugs are being produced in Fuzhou, though Shanghai remains the hotbed of drug creation."

 lecfuzhou.7.t:0 "Zhang Xiaolin's New Powerbase"
 lecfuzhou.7.d:0 "Zhang Xiaolin has established Fuzhou as his new power base for his smuggling operations, giving him and the Green Gang a sizeable advantage over other, more local, Triads. He is using his new power base already to expand his smuggling operation elsewhere within China. Many within the government ask how we should respond to this new development, as he may be an useful ally, though some say his new rival and former partner Du Yuesheng could be a more valuable one. Some propose that the best course of action is simply to try and eradicate his gang from Fuzhou, now that he has proved himself a disturber of the peace."

 lechotung.1.t:0 "Strange Things At The Vermillion Society"
 lechotung.1.d:0 "The Vermillion Society is a collection of various clubs, informal groupings, secret societies and organisations made up of wealthy and influential men in the Mandate, often from Chinese or mixed-race backgrounds. The Society's nationalist leaning is an open secret and their funding of nationalist organisations throughout China is somewhat in the open, though it has never been confirmed to be true. The Society provides somewhat of a headache to the council and represents in the broadest terms Chinese influence in the Legations. Recently, Mandate financial auditors have discovered numerous irregularities in the funding of the Society with the trail leading back to Hong Kong. While there is no evidence as to whether or not this is simple tax evasion or a much grander conspiracy, we should investigate and see where the clues take us."
 lechotung.1.a:0 "Let's see where this goes..."
 lechotung.1.b:0 "Oh I don't know anything about tax evasion."
 lechotung.2.t:0 "The Hotung Connection"
 lechotung.2.d:0 "Our investigations have borne fruit and the paper trail leads back to none other than Sir Robert Hotung of Hong Kong. Hotung is one of Hong Kong's more influential businessman and is widely respected in the city and the Mandate at large. One of the richest men in Hong Kong, Hotung controls much of the city's largest enterprises and was able to expand his influence when the British were partially evicted. Hotung is a notable Chinese nationalist and was involved in the founding of the Vermillion Society when his Hong Kong based Chinese Club merged with similar groups, with Hotung still acting as the de facto chairman of the Hong Kong branch and is by far its most notable figure.\n\nDespite his leanings Hotung is ironically one of the larger supporters of the Legations among the Chinese crowd, seeing no contradiction in his support for both Chinese nationalism and the perceived safety of the cities. Despite all this it seems the old man is despairing at the situation of China and has began desperately funding nationalist organisations across the spectrum including the fledgling KMT, the Fengtian Government and Chen Jiongming's Federalists. While funding these organisations is not illegal, tax evasion is and it gives us an opportunity to crack the monetary lifelines of some of the Legations greatest existential threats."
 lechotung.2.a:0 "Sir Robert would surely understand."
 lechotung.3.t:0 "Questions Need To Be Asked"
 lechotung.3.d:0 "The initial investigation into the KMT connection regarding Sir Robert has not gone particularly brilliant. The investigation team has been unable to locate any KMT members beyond the usual low-ranking miscreants, all of whom are unaware to the greater workings of the Kuomintang machine. To make matters worse the KMT appear to be onto us and have since retreated to the shadows. If this investigation is to go any further we'll need to call in some help. China Agency operatives are notoriously efficient, though they may meet the same end as the Mandate investigators. Du Yuesheng is a known KMT sympathiser and could very easily lead us to the KMT cells in exchange for a favour or two..."

 lechotung.4.t:0 "The Japanese Are On The Case!"
 lechotung.4.d:0 "After some drawn out negotiations, we have finally come to an amicable agreement with the Japanese. In exchange for offshoring the investigation to the China Agency, we'll look the other way on some of their more... illicit operations. While not exactly ethical, it does allow us to get to the bottom of this mystery and at a bargain too."
 lechotung.4.a:0 "All for the greater good, right?"
 lechotung.5.t:0 "The KMT Cell In Shanghai"
 lechotung.5.d:0 "The Japanese have come to us with some interesting results and have exposed a KMT cell operating in Shanghai itself. While this was always suspected, to finally have a confirmation as well as an insight into their operations. While much of the cell was able to escape and regroup, this proves some promising news for us."
 lechotung.5.a:0 "This better not get buggered up."
 lechotung.6.t:0 "Du Yuesheng's Collaboration"
 lechotung.6.d:0 "While it has always been an open secret that Du Yuesheng has sympathies for the KMT, with help from our allies in the China Agency, we have finally been able to prove his illegal involvement with the group, primarily in supplying weapons and counterfeited documents. This proves as both a blow to the KMT and primarily to Du's operations."
 lechotung.6.a:0 "The noose is closing in..."
 lechotung.7.t:0 "Cracked The KMT!"
 lechotung.7.d:0 "Great news! It seems our allies have held up and we have successfully taken the fight to the KMT managing the break their monetary lifeline. In the short-term this will not effect the wider Kuomintang but it does break their operations in the cities and has proven a heavy blow to the Vermillion Society."
 lechotung.7.a:0 "Hurray!"
 lechotung.8.t:0 "A Dead End"
 lechotung.8.d:0 "It seems the China Agency was not as resourceful as we had expected. During an operation in Shanghai, KMT XinTeFa agents were able to escape with important documents, destroying what had been left behind. While this serves as a boost to th Vermillion Society and to the Kuomintang, it at least damages the Japanese with heads beginning to role in Tokyo."

 lechotung.9.t:0 "Into the Dragon's Den"
 lechotung.9.d:0 "Du Yuesheng is a known sympathiser of the rightist Kuomintang though with a special distaste for Wang Jingwei and his more socialist elements. Even better, he is a common criminal and not averse to doing dirty work for the right price... Du could easily help us sabotage the KMT connection but in exchange he will expect far more than a mere pound of flesh and has requested that we arrange an 'accident' at the Shanghai Police Archives."

Members of the military believe that this could work in our favour as Hotung has little interest beyond securing a 'Chinese Republic' though to many within the government, his meddling is an outrage and could lure Zhang away from our grasp. Of course we could demand an explanation from Fengtian directly."

 lechotung.25.d:0 "As Fengtian is the sole and legitimate government of China, it attracts various 'charitable donations' from all over with some coming from Sir Robert Hotung of Hong Kong. As part of a monetary fraud crackdown, the Legation Cities have began to close in on disrupting Hotung's benevolent donations to the cause of the Grand Marshal. There are many Chinese men in Shanghai who would gladly do our dirty work for the right price but to sway them would cost a substantial bribe. Though if Shanghai's investigation bears fruit it could severely damage our finances..."

Before any conclusion could be reached, Hotung himself invited all officers involved to his private estate in Hong Kong and has promised to make a 'charitable contribution' to the Mandate if we are to look the other way and allow his actions to go unpunished."
