 OTT_Distribute_Miri_Land_desc:0 "Although the ideas of private land ownership were introduced into the Ottoman Empire during the 19th century and land redistribution was performed, large parts of the Empire still remain either state or direct royal property. This absence of private land tenure decreases production, which brings despotism since there is no cause for people to work.

Serving as the main election promise on which our coalition was built, its repeal is of the utmost essence."
 OTT_Abolish_Senate:0 "상원 폐지"
 OTT_Abolish_Senate_desc:0 "The Meclis-i Ayan, the Ottoman equivalent of the Senate, served little use in our political system, being primarily a way for the Padishah to place individuals favourable to his own ideas in positions which could overrule decisions made in the Chamber of Deputies. This extra weight, which only really served to grant excessive salaries to the elite, has been rendered useless as the combination of provincial and the central assemblies provide enough oversight without royal interference."

 OTT_Promote_Panislamism_desc:0 "Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte. Its greatest success can be found amongst the subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the war that would likely have been reduced without the efforts of various Islamists"
 OTT_Jizya:0 "부유세 도입"
 OTT_Jizya_desc:0 "The 'Varlık Vergisi' is a specific war tax which targets rich Armenians and Jews to fund the operations of the government.

 OTT_Empower_Sheikh_desc:0 "The role of the Şeyhülislam can best be understood as the Grand Mufti of all muslims within the Ottoman Empire. Residing over the Ulama, he is responsible for the writing of fatwas and ensures order and discipline within the religious hierarchy making him only second to the Caliph himself.

 OTT_Allies_in_the_Maghreb_desc:0 "Although lost almost a century ago, the various Muslim states of the Maghreb still look towards Konstantiniyye for guidance, paying their respects to the Caliph. Threatened by the Europeans in their endless drive for expansion, we should close the ranks and form a strong, united and most of all Muslim bloc."
 OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient:0 "동방의 동맹"
 OTT_Allies_in_the_Orient_desc:0 "For decades the Ottoman Empire has fostered relations with our distant brethren of the Orient.

 OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions:0 "오스만 군사사절단"
 OTT_Ottoman_Military_Missions_desc:0 "The military reforms undertaken by our empire have led to awe from our neighbours, whose armies still rely on tribal militias with limited training. These nations have now requested experts from Konstantiniyye to assist them in their modernisation programs, promising great compensation. The program, which hopes to strengthen the Muslim bloc, serves also as an important political tool as sending Kemalist officers could strengthen domestic control over the army."
 OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations:0 "이슬람 국가연합 창설"
 OTT_Association_Muslim_Nations_desc:0 "Envisioned as a bloc of mutual prosperity, the Association of Muslim Nations would be an economic alliance with the goal of reducing the reliance on European and American goods whilst also boosting domestic industrialisation efforts of the various participating members. If we all bind together, we can't be picked off one by one and exert a certain pressure on the powers that be."

 OTT_Council_Economic_Unity_desc:0 "As outlined in Chapter 1 of the Economic Unity Agreement, the goals of the council are as follows: "Organize and consolidate economic relations among the States of the Arab League on bases that are consistent with the natural and historical links among them; and to provide the best conditions for flourishing their economies, developing their resources and ensuring the prosperity of their countries.""
 OTT_Railway_Connection:0 "철도망 연결"
 OTT_Railway_Connection_desc:0 "With the modern age being pushed by cars and railroads, the need for an interconnected railway system has become more than apparent. Due to the difference in colonial occupants, each with their own railway gauge, we will have our work cut out for us, but plans for the unification of rail in Egypt, the Mashriq and Western Persia have already been drafted."
 OTT_Joint_Military_Planning:0 "연합훈련"
 OTT_Joint_Military_Planning_desc:0 "Built according to the Ottoman model, our allies and military partners could do with some more guidance from the Sublime Porte. To improve international cooperation and furthermore paint a strong, united picture out of the Istanbul Pact, large scale exercises in the Mediterranean and Northern Syria have already been planned."
 OTT_Reorganisation_Commision:0 "영역 재조직"
 OTT_Reorganisation_Commision_desc:0 "Our vigorous desire to reform and adapt has left huge scars on the administrative structure of the realm, as positions, mandates and offices were often not granted to the most deserving or adept, but rather to those whose favour we needed the most. Now that the state has been sufficiently saved from foreign threats however, the time has come for a large-scale clean-up that will purge the empire of its corrupt underbelly."
 OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan:0 "예레반 빌라예트 폐지"
 OTT_Abolish_Vilayet_Yerevan_desc:0 "When Armenia was conquered, trouble on the ground and continued guerrilla attacks made control over this far-flung province tricky. In an attempt to pacify the population and ensure that they couldn't pose a threat to our flank, a series of military governors were installed to maintain order. Now that the empire has taken a decisively different course however, Armenian autonomy groups have pushed for the introduction of provincial assemblies."
 OTT_Integrate_Yemen:0 "이맘국 재통합"
 OTT_Integrate_Yemen_desc:0 "Although a working relation with the Imamate was founded just before the Weltkrieg, it seems that the ambitions of Yahya were too great for this world and with his betrayal during the Levantine war, he has shown his true colours. Therefore it has become clear that the Imamate can no longer exist as a separate entity within the Ottoman Empire, and that it should be replaced by a series of provincial assemblies as to cater to its Sunni, Zaydi and Jewish population."
 OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania:0 "트리폴리타니아 빌라예트 재통합"
 OTT_Integrate_Tripolitania_desc:0 "Consisting of three distinct regions, the 'Regency of Tripolitania' has been at the side of the Sultan ever since 1551. Despite its age, the government in Konstantiniyye didn't interfere much in its local affairs as its poverty made it too expensive to embark on costly military campaigns to quell the local tribes. With the importance of the Western flank rising and the threat posed by the remaining Senussi real, the time has come to reign Libya back in."
 OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy:0 "자치법령 선포"
 OTT_Statutes_of_Autonomy_desc:0 "Although the Federation model which the Ottoman Empire recently adopted has been seen as a massive step forwards for various autonomy and separatist movements, the expansion of Ottoman control towards Egypt, Iran and the Arab peninsula has made policy makers in Konstantiniyye move towards an even more drastic version of decentralisation, wherein provinces can choose to exert even greater control over their internal affairs."
 OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan:0 "쿠르드 빌라예트 재조직"
 OTT_Reorganise_Kurdistan_desc:0 "Stretching from Anatolia to Iran, the various Kurdish fiefdoms of old have now finally all been integrated within the same state, after centuries of division between Persian and Ottoman suzerains. The huge divide between the Kurdish tribes, in language, culture and religion, has made it difficult to foster a strong nationalist entity, something our government now hopes to exploit to instil a sense of Ottomanism."
 OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan:0 "아제르 빌라예트 재조직"
 OTT_Reorganise_Azerbaijan_desc:0 "Although Shi'ite compared to our Sunni population, the links between the Turkic peoples of Azerbaijan and Anatolia have always been strong, as a similar language and culture made the exchanging of ideas and goods swift and easy. Finally ripped out of the influence sphere of both Teheran and Berlin, the time has come to reunite the Turkic people and bind them together in a stronger and unbreakable bond."
 OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan:0 "아라비스탄 에미르국 통합"
 OTT_Reorganise_Khuzestan_desc:0 "Founded in the 15th century, the Emirate of Arabistan has survived as an independent entity in the South-West of Iran clutched in-between the Ottomans and the Persians. Although the treaty of Erzurum in 1847 gave Persia the sole authority over the Emirate, the recent war with Persia has led to the acquisition of the oil rich province. With much of its governance done through the absolute rule of the Emir, much work will be required to make them fit the 20th century."
 OTT_Reorganise_Egypt:0 "이집트 빌라예트 재조직"
 OTT_Reorganise_Egypt_desc:0 "The disaster that befell the Ottoman state in the 19th century, and which was only aggravated at the turn of the 20th century, has now been corrected as Istanbul and Cairo are now finally reunited! To prevent this from happening again however, the government has decreed an extensive reorganisation of both parts of the Empire including economic, administrative and cultural adjustments."
 OTT_Reorganise_Sudan:0 "수단 문제 해결"
 OTT_Reorganise_Sudan_desc:0 "Although Sudan was never a core part of the Ottoman Empire, only being conquered in 1820 under the Ottoman vassal Mohammad Ali, it has now nonetheless found itself within our empire as its ancient connections to Egypt (strengthened under the Khedivate and later Sultanate) led to its incorporation after the Levantine War. Much work is to be done however before 'Turkiyya' will truly become an Ottoman province."
 OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly:0 "제1회 대의회 선거"
 OTT_First_Elections_of_the_Grand_Assembly_desc:0 "As territorial expansion has brought a wide variety of peoples into our empire, the time has come to confer to them the rights of all Ottoman citizens, including the right to send representatives to the Meclis-i Mebusân (Chamber of Deputies). As the size of this body has seen exponential growth due to the vast lands we recently acquired, the body has seen its name changed to 'Büyük Meclisi' or 'Grand Assembly'."
 OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_lib:0 "관세 인상"
 OTT_Raise_Import_Tariffs_lib_desc:0 "To encourage domestic industry and prevent reliance on foreign construction materials and basic consumer goods, the government will raise import tariffs substantially. Although this is a great boon for the nascent Anatolian industry, many in Beirut, Alexandretta and Haifa fear that this will greatly damage their status as gateways to the Orient."
 OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib:0 "외환거래제한"
 OTT_Restrict_Foreign_Exchange_Regime_lib_desc:0 "Lack of confidence in the Ottoman government has pushed many investors to sell off their Liras in favour of foreign currencies in recent months, to the detriment of its value. By restricting our domestic investors' capacity to sell off their Lira's we can strengthen our currency compared to the leading currencies of the world like the Mark."
 OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib:0 "수입수량제한조치"
 OTT_Quantity_Restrictions_Import_lib_desc:0 "Whilst the government aims to create a strong local industry, it too often finds itself relying on goods imported from the Donau-monarchy or the German Empire. Steel, machinery, chemicals, etc. are all imported which makes us not only reliant on those nations, but greatly hampers domestic goods as they can't compete with the cheap export products of the larger manufactures abroad."
 OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib:0 "지라트 은행 자금계획"
 OTT_Ziraat_Bankasi_Credit_lib_desc:0 "Originally the brainchild of Midhat Pasha, the Memleket Sandığı was reorganised into the Ziraat Bankasi in 1888. Providing stability and relief for farmers, still the majority of our population, the bank has been greatly expanded over the years. As prices for agricultural goods are in flux, following the collapse of Ukrainian and German markets, the vast reserves of the bank will be used to fight the crisis."
 OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib:0 "곡물위원회 설립"
 OTT_Toprak_Mahsulleri_Ofisi_lib_desc:0 "According to Law No 3491, this agency will prevent abnormal decrease or increase of the wheat prices against producers and consumers, will protect and regulate the wheat industry, will import or export wheat when necessary, will monitor wheat production trends and market movements in the world, will establish milling facilities and bakeries in locations to be determined and will carry on other similar tasks."
 OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib:0 "예산 균형"
 OTT_Balance_the_Budget_lib_desc:0 "When the Ottoman Empire collapsed under the strain of the debts it had racked up during the Crimean War, an international organisation called the OPDA (Ottoman Public Debt Administration) essentially took over our economy. The disgrace and damage it has caused remain a vibrant memory in the minds of many Turkish economists who since have sworn to maintain a balanced budget at all cost."
 OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy:0 "국가경제 자유화"
 OTT_Liberalising_National_Economy_desc:0 "The National Economy model as followed by the OHF has damaged our economy beyond repair, and instead of the promised exponential economic growth, has only served to destroy the prosperity of non-Muslim subjects for the benefit of the ruling class. No more! We will tear down this racist system and in its stead, build a new and prosperous Ottoman economy."
 OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology:0 "제국기술연구소"
 OTT_Imperial_Institute_Technology_desc:0 "Although the Ottoman Empire boasts a fair selection of institutes for higher learning, there is a severe lack of technical expertise in the realm, which has severely complicated the industrialisation of the empire. To solve this, the government has proposed to open the Imperial Institute for Technology in Konstantiniyye, in close cooperation with academics from Austria and Germany."
 OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law:0 "국가보호법 폐지"
 OTT_Repeal_National_Protection_Law_desc:0 "Enacted by the Kemalist government to protect the nascent Turkish industry, the national protection law put severe limits on Turkish imports, banning all imports for goods such as processed food, alcohol, shoes, leather goods and other consumer goods. Furthermore the imports of even materials such as cement received restriction which according to the DF greatly stifled the private sector."
 OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment:0 "외국인 투자 활성화"
 OTT_Enable_Foreign_Investment_desc:0 "Although foreign investment was never blocked by the Kemalist government, who pursued a policy of cooperation between the private and public sector, funded largely by foreign credit, they did make it harder for Ottoman enterprises themselves to solicit foreign funding without going through a state institution. That this has stifled growth is universally agreed on by the liberals and will no longer do!"
 OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law:0 "외자유치법"
 OTT_Foreign_Capital_Incentives_Law_desc:0 "Enacted at the request of the DF, the Law on Encouragement of Foreign Capital is meant to reinvigorate the Ottoman economy and make it more accessible for foreign investors through principles such as “free transfer” and “national treatment”. Heavy resistance to the bill was uttered by the OHF however who see this as the destruction of the National Economy model."
 OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration:0 "메소포타미아 석유 탐사"
 OTT_Mesopotamian_Oil_Exploration_desc:0 "Although most operations of the TPC and its German-Dutch allies are centred around Kirkuk and Mosul in the North of Iraq, large untapped reserves have recently been discovered in the South of Iraq, near the important harbours of Basra and Kuwait. Since these are also already tightly connected to the Iraqi rail network, TPC has requested a concession from the Porte to expand operations throughout Iraq."
 OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment:0 "농업장비 수입"
 OTT_Import_Agricultural_Equipment_desc:0 "Although the Ottoman Empire, unlike Egypt, is not yet capped by the size of its agricultural lands, there has nonetheless been a great drive to improve the efficiency of the large estates dotted around the country, through the use of modern equipment. Where the Kemalists primarily intended to set up domestic production of these tools, the liberals have shown a desire to skip this step and import directly from Europe."
 OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights:0 "베를린-바그다드 개발권"
 OTT_Berlin_Baghdad_Exploitation_Rights_desc:0 "When the original deal for the Berlin-Baghdad railroad was signed with German investors, they were given extensive land grants on either side of the tracks to fully develop and exploit. This arrangement changed near the end of the war however as large investors such as Deutsche Bank pulled out of the project, fearing an imminent collapse of the Ottoman state. Lacking domestic funds, we should bring this deal back."
 OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory:0 "오펠 토파네 공장"
 OTT_Opel_Tophane_Factory_desc:0 "Long discussed with Opel, the idea of a German automotive company establishing a production facility in the Ottoman Empire to cater to the rapidly growing demand for cars in the Middle East is not new. Disagreements about the financing and the nationality of its workers constantly postponed the idea. It was never buried however and our liberal government seems more than willing to reopen negotiations."
 OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank:0 "터키산업은행"
 OTT_Turkish_Industrial_Development_Bank_desc:0 "Aimed at promoting private initiative and providing loans to industrial entrepreneurs, the Turkish Industrial Development Bank is a government initiative that has been set up after long and difficult negotiations with the ruling coalition. Whilst its primary function for now is to mediate between European exporters and Ottoman importers, it plans to later on establish industries of its own."
 OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program:0 "아나톨리아 도로 계획"
 OTT_Anatolian_Road_Program_desc:0 "As the primary focus of the Ottoman economy for most of its history has been on Rumelia, Asia Minor and Syria, the interior of Anatolia is severely lacking the infrastructure expected of a modern nation. Farmers are more often than not disconnected from their villages or cities, causing massive issues for our supply chains and inhibiting the potential of integrating these people in the world economy."
 OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership:0 "토지 민영화"
 OTT_Privatise_Land_Ownership_desc:0 "The idea of private land ownership is not a new one, but remains as of today a contentious topic in the Ottoman Empire as the promising Land Reform Act, part of the Tanzimat reforms, caused massive social upheaval in the Mashriq, leading to the enforced serfdom of large parts of the Iraqi population and opposition of the conservative bloc who saw in this nothing but a shoddy attempt at European imitation."
 OTT_Populist_Economics:0 "대중주의 경제학"
 OTT_Populist_Economics_desc:0 "To their regret, the cabinet has been forced to recognise that the Ottoman people after all weren't ready yet for the full brunt of the capitalist system, and that the long awaited surge in private initiative has proven to be a dud. To remedy this and to cater to the growing unhappiness with the government, they have decided to intervene more heavily in the economy pursuing a populist direction."
 OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory:0 "터키 시멘트 공장 확대"
 OTT_Turkish_Cement_Factory_desc:0 "A key requirement for the rapid expansion of both industry and real estate, cement factories were the first successful focus of the Ottoman industrialisation plans in the 1920s. Despite this success however, the demand for cement and other building materials keeps climbing and to cater to these needs, the construction of several new factories in Asia Minor has been ordered."
 OTT_Sugar_Industry:0 "설탕산업 확대"
 OTT_Sugar_Industry_desc:0 "Although sugar beets can be found all across Turkey, it is the regions around Ankara, Konya, Eskisehir, Afyon, Tokat and Yozgat that really power production. As part of the government’s initiative to increase the production of processed food products, large sugar factories have been set up to process the sugar beets and deliver the finished products to the world market."
 OTT_Textile_Industry:0 "섬유산업 확대"
 OTT_Textile_Industry_desc:0 "An important export product of the Ottoman Empire for centuries, the textile industry encountered a large scale decline in the 19th century, as competition with the industrial weaveries of Manchester collapsed the demand for artisanal textiles. The tradition nonetheless still stands and with the collapse of the Western industries to syndicalism, the rise of the Syrian weaveries has taken the world by storm."
 OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture:0 "농업 기계회"
 OTT_Mechanised_Agriculture_desc:0 "Whilst the ox and the camel have long been trusted partners of the Ottoman farmer, it has become apparent that they can no longer compete with the smoke-billowing beasts of the industrial era. Therefore, in cooperation with loosened restrictions on agricultural imports, the liberal government has fully pulled the card of the small landowners and set up structures to assist them in acquiring material."
 OTT_Election_Factories:0 "'선거 공장'"
 OTT_Election_Factories_desc:0 "Ridiculed by the opposition as "Election Factories", the new liberal government has realised that solely reliance on the free market will not industrialise the Ottoman Empire and has now attempted to outdo the OHF national economy plans by fully committing itself to the rapid expansion of the industry, without any desire to keep a balanced budget. Will this save or destroy the Ottoman state...?"

More infuriating though is that he stubbornly refused to name a successor, and when his secretary Hasan Riza Bey attempted to extract an oral testament, he was stopped by Celâl leading to great tumult amongst the leading cadre of the party.\n\nParliament in Constantinople was quick to respond as a day of mourning and a joint statement thanking the man for his actions during the war was issued written out to "Halâskâr Gazi", the Savior Gazi (Holy Warrior).

Former Brigadier-General Kazim Karabekir however and others such as Rauf Pasha see in his message the future of the state, and the only way to avoid decay into a full dictatorship.\n\nIn the other camp, under the still insecure leadership of Ismet Pasha, plans are made to stick close to the plans uttered by the former Grand Vizier about a progressive vanguard leading the nation into a new era, and a strong guiding hand by the state until the Ottoman people are ready for self-government.

As the current Turkish language is based on a Perso-Arabic script, the Pasha has with wide support from the westernizing faction, decided that we should all swap to the Latin script which is easier to teach. Others however fear that this move would be received especially poorly in the Mashriq, and have proposed a middle way wherein the old script would be kept but severely streamlined, as to make it more approachable for the common man.

As the Millet system allowed for a plethora of special powers such as the collection of tax and the creation of new laws for the community, the citizens of these groups became less Ottoman by the day as the Europeans started influencing their day-to-day life more and more, effectively attempting to wrick them away from our Empire.\n\nPressured by the outside world, we had no choice but to watch as the power of Konstantiniyye over the Millets was reduced to practically nil. Efforts by the Young Turks to fight back against the system and to abolish the dreaded Capitulations which allowed European subjects in the Empire to be governed according to European law were only partially successful as none of the Powers was willing to give up its vast influence within our Empire.\n\nThe end of the Weltkrieg however brought a glimmer of hope for the reformists of the Empire, as with the blood of hundreds of thousands of Turkish sons, the dreaded Capitulations were finally abolished as such ushering in a new era of reform for the Eternal State.\n\nThe Millet system has survived regardless though as indecisive politics in the Ottoman Parliament and the need of both coalitions to attract the Christian and Jewish vote have thus far thwarted any attempt at reform."

With Russian, British and French destruction after the end of the Weltkrieg, an end has also come to their meddling in the affairs of the Millets who, without a powerful patron, have seen their power greatly reduced as the sole trading power in the Ottoman Empire.\n\nHowever, as the special taxes remained, and with a growing Muslim bourgeoisie, discrimination against the non-Muslim Millets has seen a steady growth over the last few years, to which the government now wishes to answer. Working together with the various authorities within these structures, an agreement was reached today to abolish the old system in return for complete equality for the law for all citizens of the Ottoman Empire under a secularist protective mantle."

The strangers promptly seized the green religious flag of Islam, which was kept in the local mosque, and planted it in the main square. There the dervish, a man called Mehmet, proclaimed himself Mehdi (the messiah), and claimed that he was sent by Allah to overthrow the godless rulers in the capital. A crowd of some hundred locals gathered in support, while the majority of the townspeople gaped undecided. Mehmet brandished a gun, announcing that the town was surrounded by the magical number of seventy thousand supporters.\n\nTwo officers pleaded unsuccessfully with the rioters to disperse, and then sent a platoon under the command of a young second lieutenant, Çerkesli Serdar. Serdar drew his gun and fired on dervish Mehmet, using a blank cartridge with which he had been issued for manoeuvres. Unharmed, the dervish declared that he was impervious to bullets, and drawing his gun in turn, wounded Serdar mortally. The lieutenant’s body was then carried to the mosque courtyard, where the dervish cut off his head and stuck it on a pole to the applause of his supporters. Two watchmen who fired on the crowd were killed.\n\nAlarmed by the tumult, a nearby regiment quickly arrived on the scene killing Mehmet and at least a dozen of his supporters.

In response to this possible connection, the government has sent a court martial under General Mustafa Muglali and has proclaimed martial law in all of Lazistan and vast swathes of Eastern Anatolian land.\n\nWhilst it is very unlikely that an orthodox order such as the Naqshbandi would ever support the messianic claims of Mehmet, reason has long gone out of the window as a regime of terror is installed against all remaining connections between the state and the Muslim faith."

To make room for these people, the government has confiscated vast swathes of land from Bulgarian landowners to distribute amongst its citizens.\n\nNot unsurprisingly, the Bulgarian people living on the land are opposing the government wherever they can, as skirmishes between Muslim Turks and Bulgars are daily occurrences throughout the region. To answer the growing crisis and to restore public order to these new acquisitions of the Empire, the army has requested a mandate to restore order, by force if necessary.

Including key politicians from all factions, both decentralist and centralist, this front strives to provide a stable transitional government until all foreign threats have abated and the internal situation has been pacified.\n\nAlthough various liberal figures, especially amongst the ranks of the HIF, have denounced the initiative as it would only serve as a cover for continued military guidance, Kazim Karabekir has openly accepted the offer and has been seen together with Inonu by the Istanbul press.

The first matter of the day however is already a very precarious one however as even though the OHF coalition no longer has the majority, we aren't as united of a front as we would have liked to be, and the choice of Grand Vizier is a hotly contested discussion subject amongst the various party leaders. Prince Sabahattin, leader of the largest party (HIF), seems set to take this position with his program of full decentralisation and his bold initiative to reinvent the Ottoman Empire. Shakib Arslan from the Mt Lebanon region seems to be his main opponent with a focus on Islamic solidarity, morality and a return to old. The Druze prince, better known as Amir al-Bayan (Prince of Eloquence) has captivated the minds and hearts of many prominent Arab families and seems to have the support of the religious establishment with some even going so far as having an ear within the palace.\n\nAs these two squabble for the position however, many are turning eyes to the DF whose support during the last liberal coalition was instrumental for its success. The relatively young party, founded by ex-general Kazim Karabekir Pasha, nonetheless has seen its election results explode with every election as the promise of a middle way between the hard-line OHF and the Liberal Entente is finding large support amongst the Turkish middle class whilst the generals personal record can count on the support of many former and present soldiers."

This news was further soured by the testimony of Aintebi citizens who pointed out that the properties were seized by the Ottoman state during the Armenian deportations and never returned, even though their original inhabitants safely found their way home against all odds.\n\nThis unfortunate correlation has had significant repercussions on the Armenian delegates of the HIF, who out of protest have announced their immediate departure from the coalition, taking up their places amongst the independents."

 ottlib.7.d:0 "As the deportations of Armenians and Greeks increased during the Weltkrieg and the death count started to ramp up, their possessions were usually left behind and confiscated by local Muslims. To deal with the growing amount of abandoned houses and other properties, these were ultimately placed under the regulations of the Abandoned Properties Laws and made possession of the state until the original owner could return and prove his ownership. During the war however, these properties were used as payment and enticement for local Kurds and other Muslims for their contribution to the war and the deportations in specific.\n\nAs the war came to an end and many of the Armenians deported along the Homs-Hama-Damascus route returned to Cilicia, the new owners of these properties were evidently less interested in returning these. A commission was sent from Konstantiniyye to solve the issue and peacefully assist in the restitution of these properties but heavy opposition from the local Muslim residents, boosted by the efforts of local CUP leaders such as Taşçızâ de Abdullah, Kethüdazâde Hüseyin Cemil Bey, Mamat Ağazâde Ali Effendi, the Kurd Hacı Osman Agha and Hafız Şahin Effendi, ultimately forced them to withdraw despite the pleas of the Central Service of Armenian Repatriation. The Armenians in question would ultimately be painted as traitors to the Ottoman Empire, enemies of the state and willing collaborators of the Entente occupation in 1918-1919.\n\nThe Armenian deputies never stopped fighting for restitution however and with their hopes invested in the HIF to finally give them back their land, they have seen in the recent sales of Miri land an opportunity to receive a fair compensation for their losses during the war. Many Muslims deputies however are firmly opposed to these ideas, with members from the OHF often even going as far as saying that this is their reward for the treachery during the war. This has prompted the Armenian deputies to lose their patience with the coalition as their inability to take a decisive stance on the issue has now led to an ultimatum.

The horse Kırat was a character in popular Turkish legend; it was the horse and trusted companion of Köroğlu, a Robin Hood-type hero who championed the causes of the common people against the oppressive regime.

In traditional Ottoman Parliamentary fashion, the conflict is not so much about the work done by the commission but rather the sectarian background of its chairman.

With the proclamation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839, these organisations were combined into the Jandarma (Ottoman Gendarmerie).\n\nServing with distinction in Rumelia after the 1908 revolution and on the battlefields in Anatolia during the Weltkrieg, the by then rebranded Umûm Jandarma Kumandanligi (Gendarmerie General Command) had proven its worth and was drastically expanded to the various Arab and Kurdish provinces. One of the issues this brought with it however, and a general complaint from many non-Turkish citizens, was that the gendarmerie (especially in the higher positions) almost solely recruited from Turkish citizens and as such couldn't be counted as a non-discriminatory organisation.\n\nTo solve this issue, the HIF has tabled a proposition to revise recruitment standards and to utilise more Arab manpower in the corps. This has led to protests from Turkish nationalists who see this loosening of standards as a liability and potential threat to the security of the Arab vilayets should revolts escalate."

Recognising their tremendous success, the corps was massively expanded under the Kemalist regime but retained its close ties to the military which made many in the then opposition believe that as long as the two remained united, the corps couldn't have an unbiased stance. A proposal put forward in 1935, in which their education would be integrated within the War Academy, was just barely refused, but shows once more the intentions of the OHF to create a monopoly on security and defence loyal to their cause.\n\nTo solve this potential threat, the Grand Vizier has proposed the Gendarmerie be detached from the Ministry of War, brought under the Ministry of Interior and their training done separate from the main Ottoman army. Furthermore he also proposes the creation of Academies in Beirut, Baghdad and Aleppo in an attempt to incorporate more Arabs into the corps."

To mediate issues raised by the minorities that these didn't represent their groups to the fullest, each of these provincial levels was accompanied by an administrative council to assist the walis and kaymakams. In practice however this solution would do little as a combination of corruption, incompetence and the reliance of the vilayets on instructions from the capital would lead to a wide array of issues making them mostly ineffective.\n\nIn an attempt to combat the inefficiency and increase the input of regular citizens in the governing of their immediate surroundings, the councils on the Vilayet level will be expanded into full regional parliaments which will serve under the federal government but have the power and ethno-religious diversity required to effectively cater to the issues posed by the vilayet.\n\nFurthermore:\n- The Sanjak level will be abolished to avoid unnecessary administrative bloat but may be reinstated in specific vilayets if the Provincial Assembly deems it necessary.\n- The wali or governor will be democratically elected amongst the people of the vilayet and confirmed in his position by the Sultan through Irade.\n- Elections for the Provincial Assembly and the wali will be held every 4 years, in between two federal elections."

This commission was made up of the kaza müdürü, the kadi, the mufti, the imam, kaza scribes, and religious leaders of non-Muslim residents. These would present a list of candidates to the next administrative level which would remove 1/3 of the candidates before moving it further up to the next administrative level which would again remove 1/3. The final list would then be used to select council members who would serve the wali for 2 years before new elections were to be held.\n\nThe new system would open elections up to all Ottoman males aged 18 and above with the age of candidacy at 30. Elected members would then directly serve on the provincial assembly.

To solve part of these issues and establish a stronger rule over the border provinces, throughout the 19th century multiple requests for the merger of the vilayets into a larger Iraqi unit were refused time upon time to avoid creating a power bloc that could threaten the central government. In 1926 however with the collapse of the British Empire and the re-annexation of Basra & Kuwait, the vilayets of Basra and Baghdad would be united and placed under the discretion of a single wali. Under Yashin Al-Hashimi in 1928, the Mosul wali will furthermore be placed under the command of his Baghdadi colleague, with the Sulaymaniyah region (inhabited by Sunni Kurds) separated.\n\nWith most of Iraq as such brought under a central command structure, many question what is supposed to happen to it now that the Vilayet Law has been revised. Some argue that it should remain a singular bloc to provide a stable frontier against the Persians whilst others believe that due to its relatively large and diverse population, it should be split up into a Sunni and Shiite part both with their own provincial assemblies.

As it is based on Islamic law, many of the reformists have protested against it as they feel that religious law has no place in a modern secular state. Christian and Jewish citizens who previously used their own legal system remain discontent with it as well, and have urged the government to reform if not outright replace the dated code.\n\nFor some however, the issue lies not within the code itself, which is a solid document and perfectly applicable to the (Sunni) Muslim subjects of the empire. They believe the problem is that the non-Muslim subjects are also being tried under it and that instead of enforcing a sharia-based legal system on all citizens, the various communities should be able to govern their own affairs. Therefore they propose to introduce a secular civil code which will deliberately be left abstract so that on the local level, the various Millets can choose to fill in the gaps and govern themselves according to their own traditions and needs.\n\nOthers see in this a catastrophe in the making, as the purpose of the Mecelle in the 19th century was to get rid of the legal complexities and put all citizens under one code of law. They instead propose to introduce a new secular Ottoman civil code which would be used by all citizens - no matter their religion - and which would also make all citizens equal under the law, something that is receiving great support from the benches of the OHF."

Oil was first struck on October 14th 1922 near the city of Kirkuk, giving way to the extensive drilling operations later established throughout the region. As interest for the Black Gold by the Ottoman government increased, the government continued to buy out shares and bring the company under its direct authority. The collapse of the German economy in early 1936 further assisted in this effort as in an attempt to salvage its assets in Germany proper, Deutsche Bank agreed to sell its remaining shares to the Ottoman government. Leaving the company as such solely in Turkish and Dutch hands, a number of new concessions were granted. The struggling economy and the lack of personnel to fully benefit from this occasion however has left these unexploited for now.\n\nNow that the government has decided to abolish its state monopolies, some are wondering whether an exception shouldn't be made for the TPC to avoid an important sector of the Ottoman economy falling in foreign hands. Co-founder of the company, Armenian Calouste Gulbenkian has shown his interest in acquiring further shares in the company but it remains questionable whether he will reinvest his profits in the Ottoman economy, instead moving back to Europe."

Furthermore it could lead to different training standards, linguistic difficulties between various regiments and possibly even the creation of a warlord-esque situation should one of the constituents decide that it has had enough of Ottoman rule.\n\nArab decentralists on the other hand complain about the strongly Turkified upper crust of the officer corps, and the inability for Arab soldiers to serve solely in Arab provinces, under Arab commanders. Furthermore they are afraid that should the army remain a centralised affair, the Turks would be able to use it to repress civilian discontent with the government and that a powerful Turkish general, such as Fevzi Pasha, could use this to enforce a military dictatorship and revert the changes made."

This ensured a stable and loyal inner circle that could stop drastic reforms if the need should ever arise. The expansion of the bureaucratic apparatus on the provincial level however, has increased expenditures exponentially which has led many to wonder what even the need is of an Upper House.\n\nTherefore with the approval of the Meclis-i Mebusan earlier today, the Ottoman constitution was revised and the institution abolished. With this royal safeguard gone however, some are starting to have second thoughts and wondering if by doing so they haven't opened up the way towards the abolition of the monarchy and the proclamation of a republic."

Especially in regions inhabited by large groups of minorities, there is a certain desire to have an institution separate from the provincial assemblies that only serves their own minority group. Based on the Millet system for religion, they ask that these are expanded and split up in more groups to better represent the inter-denominational tapestry of our nation. Especially within the Muslim category this has proven problematic as Sunnis, Shiites, Alevi, etc. are all combined under one category without respect to their individual beliefs or languages.\n\nSupport for this expansion however is minuscule at best as outside of the underrepresented groups themselves, few want to grant extra rights to those groups. Especially the question of the Shiites is problematic as since their religion does not recognise the Ottoman Caliph as the supreme head of Islam, they believe that the Shiites have no right to demand further autonomy. Should the Shiites however be willing to recognise this position, then further discussion can be held."

On the Greek Islands the situation is seen as less of an issue, although objections to the existence of a secular code in the first place, has led to minor protests throughout the region.

 ottsab.24.d:0 "Ottomanism, or the idea that all citizens identify with a shared Ottoman identity above their regional subgroups such as Turk, Arab, etc., has been one of the most influential ideas within the Empire since the early 19th Century. Far before the Young Turks took control after the constitutional revolution, the Young Ottomans were a group of reformers in the latter half of the 19th century that attempted to foster this identity, seeing in it the solution to the rise of nationalism amongst their subjects.\n\nThe idea in practice however remained mostly unsuccessful as the various Christian groups never accepted it as their own, and pan-Islamism turned out to be a far more effective way to keep the Arabs and Kurds in check. The subsequent loss of massive swathes of Ottoman territory starting in the 1870s further caused great harm to the ideal, as with the losses incurred during the First Balkan War, the Christian group found itself greatly reduced. The idea, at first held highly by the Young Turks, quickly lost prominence as in its place nationalism rose. Greek nationalists, Armenian nationalists, Arab nationalists and even Turkish nationalists all had conflicting opinions on the future of the empire and through their actions the hopes for an Ottoman identity free from religion have been almost completely shattered.\n\nNonetheless, the idea never disappeared and with the Young Turks shifting more and more towards Muslim nationalism, the liberal opposition used it as their counterproposal to an ever stricter policy. With Prince Sabahattin now in charge, the idea has returned to the forefront as his ideas of a heavily decentralised empire want to encourage a unified Ottoman identity above regional identification. Whether this policy is realistic though is far less certain, as many important sociologists have pointed out that the turning point has already been crossed and that a radical change in education policy to account for this identity would run opposite to the idea of a decentralised policy."
 ottsab.24.a:0 "Interesting"
 ottsab.25.t:0 "The Power of Pan-Islamism"
 ottsab.25.d:0 "Harking back to the origins of Islam itself, the idea of pan-Islamism was brought back to the forefront by the Ottoman sultans in the late 18th century, to exert influence over the Muslim subjects of the Czar, and to provide a metaphorical glue to the citizens of the Porte.\n\nAs the Kaiser saw in the Porte the ultimate ally to weaponise Islam and point it at his rivals, the Germans focused their efforts in the Ottoman Empire on developing and spreading this ideology in the hopes of bringing it to completion when war with the French broke out once more. Unleashing hordes of angry Muslims (German estimates were talking of hundreds of millions of rebels rising in unison), a circle of Orientalist figures close to the Kaiser saw one key figure in this entire plan: the Sultan-Caliph of the Ottoman Empire. Through German influence in Turkish statecraft and the education of its new elite, centred primarily on the armed forces, the Caliph adopted it as his own and used it himself to reign in disloyal elements.\n\nAfter the fall of Abdulhamid II in the 1908 revolution and with the ascendance of a new regime that wished to pursue a more secular path, the Germans did not give up and as the reality of the situation started to sink in, the CUP ultimately started to openly pursue an Islamic ideology. War arrived on the shores of the Dardanelles in 1915 and the call for Jihad was launched shortly after... to little success. The grand romantic scheme of the Kaiser, in which through his puppet Caliph he would be able to unleash an unstoppable tide on his enemies, bore little fruits. The idea wasn't forgotten however, rather doubled down upon, as through the network set up by Von Oppenheim and his associates various schools, forums and teachers were sent out to all corners of the world to awaken a spirit of resistance and solidarity for the Caliph.\n\nThe largest success story of pan-Islamism can be found amongst the Muslim subjects of the Mashriq, as it ensured a degree of loyalty to the Sultan throughout the Weltkrieg that would likely have been greatly reduced without the efforts of various Islamist groups. This has brought with it however a large price, as promoting Muslim solidarity makes it hard to secularise the state and limit the influence of the faith on matters of state. Furthermore the Islamist rhetoric has spread to Egypt after the end of the war where in the young nation, it found fertile ground to further develop its ideas and if necessary use them against both Sultan and Kaiser."

Outraged and convinced that the government through this clearly showed that they favour heathens over Muslims, they only became more aggressive.

 ottsab.33.d:0 "For most of the history of our empire, land ownership was built on a system of common land which was either owned by the state and then leased to farmers who paid a tax for its use, or owned by a certain tribal federation. Whilst this had the significant disadvantage that those toiling on the fields often had little desire to increase the fertility of the land or put in much effort in general, it ensured that there were ultimately little large landowners. Reforms, started already back in the 19th century in part to encourage a more sedentary lifestyle for the still nomadic tribes, have changed this concept into one where land registration became the order of the day, and where previous common land was in rapid succession claimed by certain individuals and families, as such creating a powerful caste of land owners. Iraq and the Kurdish regions have been hit hardest by this as various tribal figures exchanged their pastoral lifestyle for the bustling cities, claiming all land previously owned by the entire tribe as their own. A massive caste of farmers through these actions became landless almost overnight and with little other choice either moved through the cities, causing trouble for the already stretched amenities of these regions, or remained on the land and became subjects of a modern form of serfdom.\n\nWith a massive push on 'self-initiative', 'decentralisation' and catering to their main electoral base, - the landowners - reforms by the liberal coalition have only aggravated the situation, leading to increased support by the impoverished lower classes for the grand aims of land reform heralded by the OHF and the rising socialist parties in the Empire. Not only is this causing a shift in the political landscape towards a more ostensibly radical point of view, revenues have seen substantial drops as well, due to widespread corruption on the provincial level and the refusal by many groups to pay their share of dues to the treasury in Konstantiniyye."

Furthermore there are talks with the government to offer more Arab courses and subjects in the universities of Damascus and Beirut, but the central ministry for education has so far not promised anything.

To remedy what they see as a massive shortage, they therefore propose the creation of several federal education institutes to complement the local ones, who are subject to the Provincial Assemblies.\n\nAt these schools, in their writings referred to as Imperial Institutes of Technology, students would be subjected to a secular and science based program supervised by the federal assembly. Furthermore these schools would also offer practical educations for teachers, maintenance crew and even farmers in the hope that these will then distribute their acquired knowledge to the people in their hometowns once they return.

Nonetheless his power was greatly hindered during the CUP regime as he was reduced to a tool to dweep the masses and write out the call for Jihad whilst his position on the Imperial Cabinet was taken away and control by the Young Turks over the religious hierarchy sharpened.\n\nMany conservative forces saw these actions as an insult against both the office and the importance of Islam in Ottoman society. Further reductions in power of the office of the Caliph itself further encountered disappointement, anger and frustration as they saw these deeds not as positive for the overall administration of the Empire but an attempt to sacrifice tradition and authenticity for cheap imitation of the West. Many in the Islamist movement, whereunder Arslan himself furthermore believe that religion does still play an important role in Western society and that it is just because of their shared Christian beliefs and their dedication to them that they have been able to outclass the muslims. They believe that the attempts by the West to impose their set of rules on our society are done out of religious reasons and that their sole goal is the ultimate victory of the Cross over the Crescent.\n\nThe cabinet, inspired by Western governmental forms and occupied by those educated along Western standards and knowledge is thus in dire need of spiritual guidance and a system of checks and balances to ensure they can not abolish what is sacred. As the Caliph, for now, is barred by the constitution from directly intervening, the Şeyhülislam works without this framework and should thus be restored to his original pre-CUP position. Church and State should not be seperate as it is their unison that has led to our greatest victories and our renouncement of Islamic values that has led to our demise. No more!"

 ottars.7.t:0 "Revising the Constitution"
 ottars.7.d:0 "When the Ottoman constitution first went into effect in 1876 as the summum of the Tanzimat reforms, it for the first time in Ottoman history tried to ground the power of the Sultan. Nonetheless the constitution did not account for Sultan Abdulhamid II who after just 2 years used the executive powers he still had according to the document to prorogue parliament and greatly hinder the rights and duties granted by it. In 1908 when the Young Turk revolution was able to dislodge the tyrant from his throne, it was restored in full but this new group of reformers had learned their lesson. The great powers of the Sultan were toned down greatly, his status reduced to that of a constitutional monarch and a parliament formed that would take over almost all forms of government.\n\nThe CUP however soon came to realise that in the great diversity and political chaos of the empire, a strong central figure with tremendous power could be useful to shut down possible opposition. By employing a weak and unambitious monarch for their goals, they reasoned that they would have the executive power of an absolute monarch whilst being able to do as they saw fit. Slowly returning power to the position of the Sultan, their plan worked marvellously for Sultan Mehmet V who was smart enough not to oppose the real ruling figures. They had however not accounted for Vahdettin who with these powers was able to rid himself of the CUP grasp and rule as he saw fit with his allies in the liberal coalition.\n\nThe death of Vahdettin in 1926 and his succession by the more timid Abdulmecid II allowed much of this power to be shackled once more to a parliamentary body but still allowed him the freedom to appoint a Grand Vizier, declare war and serve as the supreme commander of the Ottoman army. The ageing Sultan never saw much reason to use these powers, very well aware of the threat the military establishment poses to his own position if he should but Ahmed IV, heir to the throne, seems to have inherited less of his wisdom and has shown interest in the designs by the conservatives to continually shift power back to the office of the Caliph.\n\nAs Parliament continues to prove an issue in this regard, the conservatives are now pushing for the restoration of the right to prorogue parliament without its permission and as such give the Sultan the power to push through the necessary reforms without parliamentary oversight."

 ottars.8.d:0 "At the request of the Grand Vizier, Sultan Ahmed IV has today called for the prorogation of parliament. Frequently used by Abdulhamid II to rid himself of parliamentary interference, this is a worrying step as it is the first clear sign that the Caliph will attempt to take back power in his own hands with the assistance of his Islamist and Royalist support base. Others are however saying that this is an unnecessary worry and that the Sultan has solely taken this decision to better prepare for the elections later this year. Recent changes of leadership within the liberal coalition and the growing foreign threat do give some reasoning for this move but the decision to limit military training exercises and the decision to send some pronounced opposition members to positions abroad does little to hide the true intentions of the Caliph."

This treachery to the Caliph runs deep in the military establishment though and we will have to revise the entire structure from the ground up to ensure that they can no longer prove a threat to the position of the monarchy.\n\nTo block possible opposition from the existing cadre, training exercises have been halted and many of those with ties to the old CUP of the more recent OHF have either been sent abroad or placed under strict scrutiny from our agents. Not all of them seem to be folding as easily though as reports of former CUP members fleeing the capital in the midst of the night have started to trickle in."

Under the rule of Vahdettin during the 20's, some of their demands were met as education for females was expanded drastically and more professions were opened up to them. Although not going as far as the OHF would have liked, with universal suffrage and the ability for women to enter politics, these reforms by the Caliph of all people were seen with horror by many conservatives who saw in this nothing but an attack on the values of Islam.\n\nWith power now, be it temporarily, shifted towards the Caliph and with Ahmed IV a lot more amenable to meeting the demands of his conservative support base, the time has come to reverse these policies and ensure that the values professed by the Holy Book are back in place. Furthermore, the decadent media outlets that allow these women to express their opposition to the faith, should be shut down immediately to avoid their message from infecting even more true Muslims."

Although many point out that this was solely because he knew from experience how the army would react to such an authoritarian move, he nonetheless kept extremism at bay with his hands-off approach to governing.\n\nAhmed IV, a younger and less steadfast man, will take over for him and continue to steer the Porte through these turbulent times."

The manufacturing economy which had seen a slow but steady growth in the CUP-era, was knocked down as the effects of the Armenian Massacres took their toll on the educated middle class. Doctors, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc. all became critical jobs as a continued exodus by Greek-Ottoman citizens in Asia Minor showed how devastating the 'National Economy' plan was to the ravaged nation. In a similar way, the agricultural sector was ruined as the real effects of the war started to sink in. The loss of the Anatolian Turkish population was mind-boggling as almost 25% of the pre-war population was gone, leaving behind an abundance of land without the manpower to work it.\n\nNonetheless, the Sublime Porte did not sit idle and plans for a swift recovery were quickly drafted, as the first post-war cabinet made it their number one priority. Railroads, left behind by investors of nations no longer existing, were nationalised. The dreaded OPDA was completely shut down and its monopolies transferred over to the state. The 'National Economy' program became the number 1 priority of the Ottoman government as the horrors of the war, and reliance on an untrustworthy non-Turkish population, left deep scars amongst the ruling elite. A Muslim bourgeoisie had to be groomed to challenge the traditional Christian dominance, the people educated and the empire finally launched into the 20th Century."

Then in 1931, the unthinkable happened, as the Nationalist coalition was decisively brought down by the Liberal Entente who reopened the economy to foreign investment and toned down the Etatist measures, so carefully crafted in the decade before. Nonetheless, the economy kept expanding as industry popped up all across Anatolia and the Levant, financed by an almost never-ending wave of economic prosperity in the German Empire and low import costs for machinery and building materials.\n\nBy the middle of the 30s, the Turkish economy had never seen better days, as a feeling of euphoria and progress could be felt from Beirut to Smyrna. Nonetheless, many have pointed out warning signs on the horizon, as increasing instability on the continent and the stagnation of the German economy will likely bring issues to the Grand Orient as well."

Nakhudas (captains of pearl fishing boats) are forced to stay in port year round as competition with the synthetic pearl originating in Japan has saturated the market, an already smaller pie due to the global economic catastrophe. Furthermore the monopoly on power of the Sheikh has given rise to a reform movement calling if not for his outright abdication, at least for the installment of a democratic body in the form of a Majlis.\n\nUnder threat from a supposed assassination plot by a group of local merchants, disgruntled princes and expatriates, the Ottoman fleet has dispatched a small vessel to the Trucial coast to deter any open aggression against the Sheikh, but tensions have only further escalated. With the ruler and his supporters entrenched on the Bur Dubai side of the creek and his opponents on the other side at Deira, it seems the whole sheikhdom is spoiling for a fight. Sporadic gunfire has reportedly been heard in the city and meddlers in the neighbouring Sheikhdoms are seemingly looking for a chance to pounce and back their horse in the fight to come."

Enraged by this decision, the Sheikh formally disbanded the Majlis, and decided to settle the argument once and for all.\n\nTaking advantage of his son's wedding to Latifa bint Hamdan of Abu Dhabi, Saeeds loyal Bedouin who were brought into town for the ceremony drew their swords, and proceeded to kill various high ranking members of the Bani Rashid, amongst whom the chairman of the Majlis. Crumbling apart due to this catastrophe, the remainder of the Reform Movement has fled to the Sheikhdom of Sharjah in the hopes of gaining the support of the Sheikh and returning to oust Sheikh Saeed."

Finding a willing ally in Sheikh Sultan of Sharjah, the new leader of the Reform Movement (Mani bin Rashid) has regained the momentum and tribesmen of Sharjah moved quickly into a sangar on the Dubai side of the Khan creek.\n\nFaced with a fragile support base, Sheikh Saeed of Dubai decided to answer their act with an official declaration of war. Sending his troops within 4 miles of Sharjah, the two camps quickly came to blows. In traditional Bedouin style however, the two sides exchanged inaccurate fire preventing any degree of significant bloodshed. When a truce was signed only a few days later, both sides had run out of ammo leaving 1 Sharjah man killed and 2 Dubai men prisoner.\n\nSince fighting had become impossible due to a lack of material, both sides have for agreed to a 3-month truce to await the next shipment coming in from Iraq."

Earlier this week, the Sheikh and his entourage were expelled from the island, sent packing to their family in Dubai, and a customs post was installed proudly waving the Persian flag.\n\nWhilst a diplomatic objection has been made by our government against the Persian aggression, there have thus far been no plans to escalate the small border conflict to any further punitive actions. In Dubai however, outrage against this move by Teheran has led many to question the capacity of the Ottoman government to defend the interests of the Gulf and their Sheikh for so easily submitting to Persian ploys."

Sparking immediate outrage from the entire population of the Trucial Coast, in a rare display of unity for the region, a squadron of the Ottoman fleet was dispatched to the region and anchored just before the coast of the Persian city of Lingah. Sending an ultimatum to the Persian government to immediately release the passengers, who were travelling under the protection of the Sultan-Caliph, escalation ultimately brought forth a salvo from the Ottoman fleet after which the white flag was hoisted on the shore.\n\nWhilst the safe passage of Ottoman subjects in the Persian Gulf has thus been reassured (by force), many are seeing in this yet another sign of a nearing confrontation between the two former enemies. With unrest rising in Palestine and friction on the Kurdish frontier, it may even seem that this confrontation is coming sooner rather than later."

Likely influenced by Egyptian rhetoric, the League of National Action has also embraced a Qawmi or greater Arab identity as opposed to the Syria focused Watani identity of the Damascene elite.

The Muscati navy, their lifeblood and pride for centuries, has been entirely wiped out as the industrial behemoths of the seas have outclassed the classical Dhows leaving the defence of the peninsula solely to the goodwill of its neighbours.

This zone, for whom the great powers that be (and the Ottoman Empire) would be responsible in terms of protection, would be governed as a free state where foreign investors can have free reign (albeit within the limits of the law).\n\nThe second option, preferred by the Ottoman state, is the integration of the Canal Zone into its domain but with various concessions and restrictions granted to foreign nations. So foreign warships would be allowed to pass in peacetime, trade never obstructed (even in wartime) and the Suez company would retain majority shares in the Canal.

Two decades have passed since then and with the Russian Empire restoring its glory of old, hawks in our government have urged us to blow off the deal with the Ottoman Turks by demanding the liberation of Armenia, a demand we are sure they will refuse, and plant the banner of Mother Russia on the ramparts of Constantinople."

Greek hawks further to the West however, have long claimed the region as part of their nation, insinuating that the large Greek minority living there and the historical dominance of the Byzantine Empire over it make for a rightful Greek territory."

Recent discoveries in metallurgy have given the region a second boost as the Chromite ore, plentiful in the South of the Vilayet, is in high demand for the war machines of both Germany and France.\n\nMuch like other vilayets close to the Aegean, a close cooperation exists between the Christians living on the coasts of the Sea of Marmara and the Turkish Muslims occupying its highlands.

Little investment was done in the region before the discovery of coal near Zonguldak, which was exploited to its fullest during the Weltkrieg, until bombardments of its harbour forced the Ottomans to halt their coal transports.\n\nThe loyalty of the people to the reforming Ottoman nation stands strong, as the small urban population of the Vilayet has shown their support for Kemal’s reforms, whilst the much larger rural population has shown no real desire to get entangled in politics and refrains from forming any real opposition."

They argue that if we look at the entire Vilayet, the population is predominately Muslim and Turkish, although this neglects the importance of the Greek population which represents the majority of the Vilayets economic power.\n\nNot only ethnically, but also politically, the population is divided, as Muslim inhabitants have shown their desire for continued centralisation in the hopes of encouraging social promotion of the comparatively poorer Muslim population. Greek citizens on the other hand are conflicted as they agree with the OHFs progressive stance on religion and legal affairs, but fear that continued centralisation could lead to the abolition of the Millet system and increased Turkification."

Mining also has a presence in the Sandjak as the city of Mugla is one of the Empire most renowned centres of Marble, and the Chromite extraction is steadily growing in Fethiye.\n\nPolitically the region supports the Kemalist agenda, especially their interventionist economic policies, in the hopes that heavy-handed state development can further develop the still fairly backwards region."

Shaken up by the violent deportations and massacres of Armenians and Greeks as well, the middle class of the region further received a hit during the Weltkrieg, driving its already low economic status, literacy and population density have only further down.\n\nAlthough serving as the footmen in the Ottoman army and experiencing massacres at the hand of the Entente invaders during the Weltkrieg, its people remain loyal to the Ottoman state and populist rhetoric by Kemal Pasha promising a strong response to the continued issues, has swung them firmly inside the camp of the OHF, as not only its interventionist agenda speaks to the minds of the people, but many of them served directly under him during the last days of the Weltkrieg and see in him the future of their nation."

Unexploited mineral resources furthermore linger in its highlands awaiting further exploitation.\n\nOne cannot deny the severity with which the region was hit during the Weltkrieg as its prosperous Armenian population, responsible for much of the aforementioned industry, evaporated overnight as deportations and massacres culled the majority of them. As the war approached its end however, and the likelihood of an Entente victory decreased, some of the thousands that were forced to leave all their belongings behind were allowed to return to the region seeing their properties confiscated and their rights stripped. Those that are left remain bitter and with a desire for revenge but their almost negligible population counts have eroded their capacity to organise any significant opposition to their Muslim administrators."

Just as in the other Christian regions of the empire though, the deportations and massacres struck deep as the Pontic Greeks were targeted by the plans of Talaat Pasha. Contrary to the Armenian population however, the majority of the Greek population survived the massacres, and although refugees have been fleeing the region ever since the start of the Weltkrieg, the recent improvements in Greek-Ottoman relations and the flourishing economy have ensured a slow recovery of the pre-war Greek population.\n\nTensions remain high between the Muslim majority and the Greek minority as the latter’s political status and wealth is met with jealousy from the poor Turkish inland sandjaks. This tension is also reflected in Konstantiniyye, as the Greeks flock to the banner of the OPAD in the hopes that their decentralisation program will protect them in the future. The Turkish majority however, has found solace in the rhetoric of Mustafa Kemal, who promises a stronger Turkish people and state directed programs to assist the impoverished Turks."

Originally even claimed by the Armenian state, very little remains of its non-Muslim population as the massacres struck the area hard and thousands of Armenians were slaughtered during the Weltkrieg. Reprisals by Russo-Armenian troops before the 1917 revolution made matters even worse as the already exhausted population suffered another hit, now to its Sunni population. As the end of the Weltkrieg arrived for the Lazi people, their lands have been ravaged by war and constant migration. Their economy, based on agriculture (mainly the export of hazelnuts) and the exploitation of the Zinc mines, has not aged well either as many have permanently left the region in search of better lands.\n\nThe Lazi people share many similarities with the Georgian people further up North, and although the difference in religion between Christian Georgia and Muslim Lazistan have thusfar led to little cooperation between the two regions, Georgian spies have been caught in the region who have supposedly been attempting to gather support for an anti-Ottoman insurrection.

The war has not been kind to this Armenian population however, as what once constituted 30% of the total population has now been reduced to the single digits, with those that remain afraid of further punitive actions by the Ottoman government. The nearby Armenian Vilayet has attracted many of the survivors of such atrocities as no attempt was made by the Ottoman Empire to stop them from leaving. What is left is a Muslim province inhabited by Turks and a Kurdish minority loyal to the Ottoman regime that has saved them from Russian advances and the Armenian reprisals.\n\nIts economy is solely based on agriculture, with the majority of its lands devoted to the cultivation of grain and the remaining part used for animal husbandry. Around the pastures of Ardahan and Kars there is also a sizeable beekeeping culture although its effects on the overall economy remain fairly low."

Home of the Diyarbakir Ulu Camii, the fifth holiest site in Islam and one of the oldest churches in the world, the city and its region suffered greatly during the last years of the Weltkrieg, as illness, fire and misery plagued its population.\n\nServing as an important strategic location for the Ottoman armed forces on the Eastern flank of the Empire, it is closely supervised by the Empire in the hopes of avoiding another confrontation with the Kurdish people. Resistance to Konstantiniyye remains little for the moment, but fears of the far reaching secularisation promoted by the OHF and the centralised control rule within the Kurdish region, as they are afraid that without the uniting factor of the Caliphate, the Turks will slowly but surely push them out."

Where other Vilayets were affected to varying degrees by the ethnic cleansing, Van has been the centrepiece of some of the worst massacres as both Ottoman and Armenian forces slaughtered without impunity, drastically reducing the population of the region. Especially the city of Van itself, home to a sizeable Armenian population, was decimated as the advancing Ottoman troops during 1918 put 55,000 Armenians to the sword. It goes without saying that the memory of these massacres is still deeply rooted in the consciousness of the local population and although the remainder, now fully Muslim of Kurdish and Turkish descent, is loyal to the Empire, a certain fear lingers within the Kurdish population that a far-reaching secularisation and dismantlement of the Islamic unity on which the Empire stands, could lead to them being next in another series of attacks."

Developing into their own distinct culture, they are quite different from the Anatolian Turks to the North and are in some regards closer to the steppe people further East.\n\nThis otherwise irrelevant part of the Ottoman Empire was brought into the spotlight just before the Weltkrieg, when rumours of oil near the city of Kirkuk started spreading. As the war ended in 1920 and the Ottoman government was more than eager to find a new source of revenue, exploration was started. Oil was struck on October 14th 1922, near the city of Kirkuk, giving way to the extensive drilling operations later established throughout the region. Funded with this new black gold, the city of Kirkuk became the third most important city in Iraq and has been granted a special statute by the central government to oversee and guard the operations.

Relying for almost its entire economic output on animal husbandry and the cultivation of wheat and linseed, it is by no means a modern Vilayet, and it has been lagging behind many of its neighbouring regions industrially.\n\nNonetheless it serves as an important region for the Ottoman army, as the strategic location of the city of Erzurum has time upon time proven its worth, most notably during the Weltkrieg, when Yudenich’s Russian forces assaulted the city in 1916. Whilst the fortress did not stand the Russian onslaught, it was recaptured in 1918 and has since then been reinforced to once again serve as the last line of defence for the Caucasian campaign."

Issues with Konstantiniyye quickly rose afterwards, and movements clamouring for the unification with Greece gained further traction throughout the region.\n\nAlthough its people have been staunch supporters of unification with Greece, the isles prospered greatly during the 19th century, becoming a hub for many rich Greeks in the Empire to relax and deal in lucrative trade with the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nLost during the Italo-Ottoman war in 1912, the isles served under Italian military administration for almost ten years when they were formally returned to the Empire with its pre-war status restored as part of the Vilayet of the Archipelago."

Previously mostly inhabited by the Marsh Arabs, the hinterland of the Vilayet received almost no attention from the Ottoman government, and as such its population was almost entirely apolitical, only appearing on the radar of the government when they lynched missionaries sent to convert the Shi'ite population. Most economic activity was thus situated near the coastline, where date plantations formed an important trade resource, whilst pearls were primarily fished up around Kuwait.\n\nThis picture would see a radical change in 1920. With the collapse of the Entente and the need for a peace settlement in the Middle East, the Ottoman government was forced to sign the Basra Accords. The Assyrian people had lived for millennia on the plains of Nineveh, and had come under substantial fire during the Weltkrieg, when deportations and exterminations aimed at the Armenian population started to spread to the Assyrians. Resisting for as much as they could, and joining the war on the side of the Entente, they were no match for the Ottoman military. Fleeing with tens of thousands to Lake Urmia in Persia, they were forced to leave a second time as Simqi the Kurd ordered his troops to slay thousands of refugees. As a final resort, the British government ultimately decided to resettle the Assyrian people in the Vilayet of Basra as far away as possible from Anatolia. Less openly expressed however, was the plan of the British to utilise the Assyrian people, whose loyalty was guaranteed, as a tool to expand their influence in the Persian Gulf and secure the flank of their oil operation in Khuzestan."

Lebanon has been for most of its history under the Ottomans an autonomous emirate, governed by Druze clans who pledged loyalty to the Sultan. The favouritism for Druze dynasties in positions of power and granting privileges to Muslim sects, soon alienated the vast population of Christians around Mount Lebanon, particularly the Maronite sect. A series of revolts in the last two centuries culminated in open civil war between Christians and Druze, a crisis which caused political intervention from Western imperial powers into the Ottoman Empire’s internal affairs. The end result was the Ottomans conceding to European and Maronite demands to grant Christians a strong autonomy in the form of a Mutasarrifate.\n\nOwing to its unpopularity among the reigning anti-concessionist government, it was abolished during the Weltkrieg and absorbed into Djemal Pashas Syrian fiefdom. This period in Lebanese history was marked by famine, political repression, war crimes and strife, relieved only by the Mutasuffariate's eventual resurrection in the mid-1920s. Owing to a lack of cohesive national unity, no major organized resistance to Ottoman rule has sprung up in the region for almost a decade.

Ottoman sovereignty however, did not penetrate the hinterland because of the desert ecology, the lack of revenues for a major cross-desert campaign, and the existence of another state, that of Awlad Muhammad, which was founded in 1550. The Awlad Muhammad state was a trading state, and emerged as a station for organizing and protecting trade caravans. Fezzan provided this state with the largest market in the Sahara trade between Bilad al-Sudan, the Maghrib, and Egypt. This wealth naturally lured the administration in Tripoli to take over the trade. Awlad Muhammad sultans resisted the Ottomans; whenever defeated, they would withdraw into Lake Chad's region to recruit soldiers, especially their allies the rulers of Katsina, and return when the Ottoman army had left Fezzan. Faced with a military expedition from Tripoli, the state would however finally fold in 1812.\n\nWhen the Trans-Saharan trade collapsed in the late 19th century due to war in Chad, Fezzan became an afterthought and despite some attempts to establish more control, these wouldn't last. The Italians would experience the difficulties of the Ottoman and Qaramanli States when they were soundly defeated by a coalition of Senussi associated tribes, a defeat that would ultimately lead to the Italian catastrophe of 1915. With the departure of Italian forces and the return of Tripolitanian control, the region remained fairly untouched. An exodus of Fezzan citizens, enticed by the capitalist prospects of the Coast, has led to a further decrease in importance which has led to a sharp contrast in terms of development between the Coast and Fezzan."

The introduction of cotton around that time gave the city a new lease on life as an export city, but the opening of the Suez canal to European trade forever ended Aleppo's dominance in the cotton trade with Europe.

This Jewish population would later also lead to the Balfour declaration by the British government, and the Talaat declaration which followed it, both promising to grant the Yishuv rights for the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine. When the tide of war turned and the British were forced to evacuate the Mashriq, they nonetheless saw an opportunity in the declarations, and after a long diplomatic struggle succeeded in establishing the M.O.J, an international mandate aimed at keeping the peace in Palestine.\n\nThis mandate was however seen by the Muslim population of the Middle East as an affront, and quickly gave rise to the establishment of a large resistance movement aimed at stopping Jewish settlement, abolishment of the M.O.J. and the full restoration of Ottoman, Sunni, rule.

The Greek community was allowed to retain various privileges however, as under the Millet system, they were responsible for their own religious duties, education and the development of Greek culture. The Ottoman Empire further encouraged this by appointing the Archbishop of Cyprus as the sole representative of the Orthodox community and gradually of the ethnic Greek group.\n\nAlthough an experiment was executed in the late 19th Century when the Mutasarrifate was temporarily abolished and integrated into the Vilayet of the Archipelago, the attempt ultimately failed as the distance to its new capital (Çanakkale) led to a communication and administrative headache. The decision was ultimately reverted in 1870. The Ottoman-Russian war brought further changes to the island as in a secret agreement with Britain, control over Cyprus was handed to the British. The many Cypriots who expected this to be a definitive turn towards self-government were badly disappointed however, as all power was to be held by London with very little representation of the Cypriots in their own affairs.\n\nThe independence of Greece played another important role in the history of Cyprus, as with it the calls for Enosis or Unification with Greece intensified, soon engulfing the entire island.

During the Durrani wars of the early sixteenth century, the Ottomans invaded the region, although they were soon driven out again. During the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans fought the Entente throughout the western regions of supposedly neutral Iran. Urmia was taken in 1915, and the Turanist project of Enver Pasha seemed to be approaching realization. However, after the war ended in 1919, the Central Powers were forced to leave the region to what remained of the Qajars. Now under Turkish control once more, Western Azerbaijan seems likely to remain a counterbalance to rebellious Armenia, hard to the northwest. Still, full integration will take time."

 OTT_Population_Kurdistan_desc:0 "The mountains of Southern Kurdistan were under Persian control until the Ottoman Empire took these lands in the recent conflict. It is not the first time that Ottoman troops marched into this part of Kurdistan, it being the border between the Sublime Porte's lands and the various Persian empires for centuries. The administrative central of the former Iranian province is Kermanshah. While it was decently prosperous region for most of history, its economy took a hit when the traditional methods of transportation along the silk road were replaced by routes on the ocean in the last century. Being the new occupier of the land and having shown dangerous tendencies in 1916 when the Kurds were deported to the outskirts of the Ottoman Empire, the conservative Kurdish sheiks look to Konstantiniyye with suspicion."

 OTT_Population_Khuzestan_desc:0 "Khuzestan has stood out from the other provinces of Persia, since its population, although majority Shiite like the rest of the country, is Arabic. In the north of Khuzestan however live the Lur, an Iranian people that was forced to give up their nomadic lifestyles recently under Persian rule. Part of the Fertile Crescent, Khuzestan has played an important role in the history of the region since antiquity. The ancient Persian empire had its capital in Khuzestan, in the city of Susa. Susa was destroyed in the Mongol invasions, and since then Shushtar and the commercial port of Ahvaz have taken the place as the most prominent towns of the province. The sea is an important resource for Khuzestan, with Ahvaz being a gateway to inner Persia, and fishing is a major food source. The Ottoman takeover of the province is met with mixed feelings. While the Persian rule was never popular, the new economic competition of the other harbours at the coast is not a cause to celebrate for the people of Khuzestan."

 OTT_Population_Ajdabiya_desc:0 "The city of Ajdabiya lies at a crossroads of traditional caravan routes. Only a few kilometres inlands from the sea, the roads and routes along the Libyan coast, up to Benghazi in the north, meet with the caravan tracks that lead inwards to Jaghbub and Kufra to the south of the Cyrenaica. The town centre is dominated by the ruins of a castle built by the Fatimids thousand years ago, who used Ajdabiya as their bridgehead into Egypt, which they ultimately conquered in 969. The town itself lying on a flat, rocky plateau with little agriculture, it is the wells and cisternes that keep the town alive and crops growing. While not a stronghold of the Senussi Order like the oasis towns to the south, it still was part of their domain and the local Ottoman officials will have to find a way to win the populace over to the order now uphold by the Sublime Porte."

 OTT_Population_Jaghbub_desc:0 "The oasis town of Jaghbub lies in the outliers of the Libyan desert, closer to the Egyptian Siwa than to any other city in the Cyrenaica. It controls an important caravan route on the way to Egypt and many camels loaded with goods make stop at the waters of Jaghbub. The land around it is dominated by the desert sands, broken up by sharp rocks of dolomite. Before Ottoman troops forced the Senussi Order to retreat to Kufra, Jaghbub has been the centre of their movement since 1856. When the Order set up their headquarters, still under the leadership of its founder Muhammad as-Senussi, a wall was built around the small town and a Zawiya opened its doors that became an Islamic school of renown. Muhammad as-Senussi's tomb is in Jaghbub and attracts pilgrims from all over the Sahara."

 OTT_Population_Kufra_desc:0 "The region of Kufra is dominated by the vast sands of the Sahara desert. The oases in this wasteland only became settled in the 19th century by the local Arab tribes, with Al Jawf, "the centre", being the central town at the largest of the oases of the region. The first European to set foot there was a German explorer only in 1873. The remoteness of the southern most frontier of the Cyrenaica is what led the the Order of Senussi to set up their headquarters in Kufra. The Ottoman Empire had forced these unruly zealots out of Jaghbub in 1895. Now that it is under Ottoman control, much work awaits the local officials. While it is an important waypoint for caravans crossing the Sahara and was the main centre of Senussi thought, being a region of strategical importance for the whole of Libya, order must be restored, and this part of the desert largely remains not yet even mapped."
