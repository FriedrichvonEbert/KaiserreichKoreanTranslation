### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ADALBERT_I_DESC:0 "아델베르트 폰 호엔촐레른의 플랑드르-왈로니 국왕 재임기간은 꽤 특이했습니다. 대관식이 아니라 헌법에 대한 맹세를 통해 즉위하였고, 또한 대중의 성향에 맞춰 가톨릭으로 개종한 아델베르트는 오랫동안 국민들의 존경을 받고 싶어했습니다. 그러나 독일 정권 하에서 수년간 지속되어 온 탄압과 기존 벨기에 왕정보다도 더 절대적 형태의 군주제에 집착하는 경향을 보이는 아델베르트는 국민들 사이에서 큰 반독 정서를 야기했고 곧장 멸시받게 되었습니다."
POLITICS_ALBERT_I_DESC:0 "대전 당시 예셀에서 독일 침략군을 몰아낸 국왕인 알베르 작센코부르크고타가 캐나다 망명 생활을 끝내고 드디어 벨기에로 귀환했습니다. 대전 후 처음으로 알베르의 자동차 행렬이 브뤼셀에 도착했을 때, 전국의 교회 종은 우렁차게 울렸고, 많은 벨기에인들은 기쁨에 겨워 눈물을 흘렸습니다. 그러나 벨기에 내의 친독파들과 생디칼리스트들은 국왕의 귀환을 한탄하고 새로운 벨기에 정부를 약화시킬 음모를 꾸미고 있습니다. 알베르는 이제 벨기에를 더럽혀왔던 깊은 상처를 치료하고 국민들에게 새로운 희망을 선사해야만 합니다."
POLITICS_JORIS_SEVEREN_DESC:0 "요리스 반 세버렌, 독일 점령군에 마지못해 협력한 플랑드르의 지도자가 이 나라를 지배합니다. 그의 베르디나소 세력은 영토확장과 가톨릭의 진흥 등 벨기에 사회 전반에 대한 급진적인 비전을 갖고 있습니다. 반 세버렌의 통치 아래의 벨기에는 이전의 나라와는 틀림없이 달라지게 될 것입니다."
POLITICS_PAUL_ZEELAND_DESC:0 "파울 반 젤란트와 가톨릭당이 독일의 지배에 대항해 플랑드르 저항군을 이끌고 있습니다. 현재 복원된 벨기에에서의 선거에서 승리한 반 젤란트는 벨기에에서 기독교 민주주의의 확립을 위해 노력하고 있으며, 벨기에 국민인 플랑드르인과 왈롱인을 갈라놓는 화해에 힘쓰고 있습니다. 그의 정책 목표의 원칙은 농민과 산업 노동자 모두의 노동 조건 개선입니다."
POLITICS_BELGIAN_PARLIMENT_DESC:0 "독일 통제하의 플랑드르-왈로니 정부의 조언을 받던 플랑드르 의회를 계승한 벨기에 의회는 최근 복원된 벨기에에서 권력을 장악했습니다. 정부가 개혁되고 선거가 준비되는 동안, 의회는 입법부로서뿐만 아니라 임시 국가 수반으로서 집단적으로 행동합니다."
POLITICS_HENRIK_MAN_DESC:0 "온건한 사회민주주의자인 헨릭 더만은 벨기에 노동자당의 지도력을 공고히 했으며, 이제 벨기에의 최근 전국 선거에서 승리를 거두었습니다. 더만은 제한된 경제 국유화와 노조 지도자들이 정부의 자문 역할에 대한 권한을 부여받는 것을 지원합니다. 벨기에의 더만은 국민들을 적극적으로 섬기고 공정한 경쟁을 촉진해야 한다고 믿고 있습니다. 벨기에의 개혁은 논란의 여지가 있지만, 벨기에의 경제적 어려움과 정치적 급진화를 감소시킬 수도 있습니다."
POLITICS_JOSEPH_JACQUEMOTTE_DESC:0 "세계대전 이전의 극좌 성향 신문 '르'엑스플로이테'의 제작자이자 편집자였던 요섭 야크베모터는, 당 내의 벨기에 노동당 생디칼리스트 파벌에서, 그리고 지금은 벨기에 자체에서 모두 승리를 거두었습니다. 야크베모터는 농촌 산업화와 산업과 농업의 집단화를 모두 지지합니다. 야크베모터가 이끄는 벨기에에서는 급격한 사회 경제적 격변이 일어날 것이 확실합니다."
POLITICS_PAUL_HENRI_SPAAK_DESC:0 "한때 저명한 변호사였던 폴앙리 스파크는 무엇보다도 진정으로 국민을 위해 봉사하기 위해서는 정부의 관료제가 효율적이어야 한다고 믿고 있습니다. 스파크는 현재 벨기에 노동자당을 장악하고 있으며, 뒤이어 가장 최근의 벨기에 전국 선거에서 당이 승리한 것이 그를 국가 원수로 격상시켰습니다. 스파크는 이미 벨기에의 비대해진 공무원들을 크게 줄이기 시작했고, 예비 기업가들에게 새로운 인센티브를 도입했습니다. 그 결과, 벨기에에서는 낙관론이 꾸준히 증가하고 있는 것 같습니다."
POLITICS_PAUL_EMILE_JANSON_DESC:0 "파울에밀러 얀손과 자유당은 벨기에의 최근 총선에서 승리를 거두었습니다. 얀손은 자유방임주의 경제 및 자유 무역의 옹호자입니다. 얀손에게 있어 사회의 모든 측면은 과거 행정부에 의해 지나치게 규제되어왔습니다. 얀손 휘하의 벨기에는 빠르게 유럽과 세계에서 경제적으로 가장 자유로운 나라 중 하나가 되고 있습니다."

belbla.8.d:0 "Originally founded by the German occupiers during the Weltkrieg, the Nationale Landbouw- en Voedingscorporatie, or 'National Farming and Food Corporation' dictated a strict and planned policy to keep Belgian agriculture afloat. While the organisation was dismantled after the war since rations and military management were no longer necessary, the failure of the Middenkredietkas and Boerenbond to assist in the Black Monday crisis has prompted the pro-German regime to rekindle these plans and consider reforming the agency."

The army was finally able to suppress the rioters by opening fire. 106 rioters would find their death the same day and hundreds more were arrested in the following days. We seem to have temporarily regained control but strong measures will have to be implemented to prevent another disaster."

bel.5.d:0 "Trapped in the palace but safe from the rioters outside, the king decided not to resort to the use of heavy weaponry and has instead sought to deal with the protesters solely by using local police battalions. However, the riot has proven not to be so easily suppressed and has started to spread throughout the entire city. Student organisations in the cities of Leuven, Ghent and even Brussels itself had been preparing their own protest march and quickly organised themselves. Chanting the Brabançonne and the Vlaamse Leeuw, waving banners and protesting through the streets, the protests have quickly become nearly insurmountable for the Police."

bel.141.d:0 "During the night a dozen members of the Witte Brigade stormed the headquarters of the Vlaamse Wacht located in Antwerp. The Vlaamse Wacht or Flemish Watch, was used as a reserve for the Feldgendarmerie and held a large arsenal in reserve. It seems that they may have had assistance from the inside as they were able to quickly get in and leave before reinforcements could arrive. Voices in the king's circles are calling for the abolishment of the Vlaamse Wacht as they may betray us and side with Flemish liberation movements."

Accompanied by a convoy of 15 soldiers and their officer, they left for Leuven. However between Boortmeerbeek and Haacht the train was stopped by three young men who, under fire from German forces, opened the prison train and allowed 168 of the prisoners to escape before the Germans regained control of the train."

They are a resistance movement composed almost entirely of students from the ULB, free university of Brussels. Encouraged by the protest at the universities of Ghent and Leuven, a group of engineering students from the ULB prepared a nationwide attack on the railroad system. This was the first time an attack occured in both Flanders and Wallonia by the same group. We will have to stay wary of further cooperation between the two regions."

bel.144.d:0 "Reports have reached us that the deserting forces are gathering in the villages around Poperinge. They seem to rally as close as possible to the French border, making large scale troop movements by us difficult. Charly Claser, leader of this movement has started to expand the group very fast, exceeding our expectations. They are however in contrast to the other groups an (secret) army with a chain of command and armed to the teeth. It will not be easy to crack them down and we will have to keep a close eye on them."
bel.144.a:0 "Station a small brigade in the city of Ieper to keep them in check."

bel.14.t:0 "Status of the Flemish Resistance"
bel.14.d:0 "While we were trying to counter the Walloon syndicalists and had to withdraw some of our forces out of Flanders, the Flemish decided to work more underground and have been recruiting members into their movement. Priests have tried to convince their parochians to take up arms and liberate the nation while rebels in the cities have diffused illegal newspapers and propaganda to enlist as many as possible. The recruited rebels, guided by experienced veterans from both the army and veterans from the Weltkrieg, also performed small, coordinated raids against German transports and have been able to acquire quite the armoury. It's not yet clear what they are up to but it would be wise to reinforce our control over Flandres, risking loss of control elsewhere."

With German forces spread thin to suppress the resistance the Flemish Resistance has prepared a massive attack to liberate the cities of Bruges, Gent, Kortrijk and Oostende.

bel.808.d:0 "Die Rote Kapelle or the Red Orchestra, is the largest syndicalist resistance network in Europe. With members spread across the continent and receiving assistance from both Paris and London, this inteligence group is huge threat to our national security. Due to their non-violent nature, they are difficult to track down and previously all attempts at trying to root them out have yielded poor results.\n\nNow, however it appears that Efremov, leader of the Flanders-Walloon branch has been captured in Oostende while seeking to move between safehouses. He was immediately interrogated and at last he gave up important members of the movement, representing a new breakthrough in our efforts. After a wave of arrests in the following hours, thirty members of Die Rote Kapelle were caught and executed. A heavy blow has been dealt to the organisation."
bel.808.a:0 "Finally, results!"

bel.805.t:0 "Expansion of the Feldgendarmerie"
bel.805.d:0 "News of our difficulties in pacifying Flanders-Wallonia has reached Berlin and apparently greatly troubled the Kaiser. German geopolitical interests in Western Europe, centering on the Ludendorfflinie, are reliant on a secure front in former Belgium. Therefore the Kaiser has given the order to send a specialised division of the Feldgendarmerie to aid the Flemish-Walloon police force in their struggle. Still, relying on the aid of foreign forces to combat our own citizens may however further alienate the regime and our king from his subjects."

bel.81.t:0 "Germany Demands Increased Taxation"
bel.81.d:0 "With the German Empire slowly recovering its confidence and power from Black Monday, they have seen fit to demand that our king institute a large tax aimed at the middle and lower class to help the German economy. Unfortunately, Flanders-Wallonia has also been hit very hard as the country is heavily industrialised and due to the crisis many citizens have been left without jobs.\n\nWhile a massive tax imposition would certainly improve our relations with Berlin, it may severely hurt our own chances of a quick recovery and stir up anger among the people."

bel.82.t:0 "Trade Agreement With the German Empire"
bel.82.d:0 "With the onset of a new economic climate due to the impact of the Black Monday crisis, we have the opportunity to renegotiate a trade deal with the Reich. With a strong industry based around steel, textiles and chemical expertise, Flanders-Wallonia is without a doubt one of the major industrial powers in the Reichspakt. As a result a large proportion of German imports come from our country, despite our political subjugation. With this new opportunity however, it is now time to renew the agreement and decide whether to keep focussing on exporting to the Empire or to focus more on benefitting Flanders-Wallonia itself."
bel.82.a:0 "Focus on benefitting the Empire"

bel.82.c:0 "Focus on a Flanders-Wallonia first policy."

bel.83.t:0 "Weapons Production For the German Army"
bel.83.d:0 "Due to Germany's massive increase in demand for armaments caused by serious border tensions with the French Commune, the German Army is in need of specialised equipment. Flanders-Walloon expertise concerning small arms and anti-tank cannons is widely appreciated and praised even in the higher echelons of German High Command. Due to this reputation, the Reich has offered us a new deal where we supply them with weapons in exchange for monetary compensation. Still, due to Germany's ravenous appetite for new arms our own forces may suffer supply shortages if we agree to the deal."
bel.83.a:0 "Export as many weapons as they require."
bel.83.b:0 "Prioritise our own army."

bel.831.t:0 "State Treasury Investigation"
bel.831.d:0 "Every year a special commission is established by Parliament to investigate the entire monetary balance of the country. This has, since the start of the occupation, traditionally been the the role of members of the Flemish Council, however due to recent events the king has become more inclined to let an outside German commission investigate to make sure that any corruption or covert operations are discovered. This would cause extreme turmoil in Parliament though, as members would see this as yet another power grab by the king and the German puppet regime neglecting the wishes of the people."
bel.831.a:0 "Request that Germany appoints an external commission."

bel.832.t:0 "The Investigation Progresses"
bel.832.d:0 "As the Flemish Council goes through the budget like it has done every year it has encountered a large source of expenses. Recent renovations to the Palace and the German Embassy have cost the taxpayer untold millions of Marks. In these troubling times such expenses should not be allowed and will only further increase the burden on the common man. Therefore the Council has proposed to the king that he delay the works until after the Black Monday crisis abates."

German immigrants and imperial citizens are far more likely to reach high ranking positions in our society and seem able to exert more influence over the country than Flemish-Walloon citizens. While this way of handling things is appreciated by the German population, it causes great discontent among the rest of the citizenry.\n\nJoris Van Severen, a leading member of the Flemish Council has proposed combating this favouritism and indirect discrimination through a series of strong new measures. While such moves would be greatly beneficial for social harmony, they would inevitably receive fierce opposition from the Reich."
bel.842.a:0 "We will not change our way of life for these pesky peasants"

bel.843.d:0 "Due to recent reforms introduced by Joris Van Severen concerning the status of German citizens, many have marched on the capital today to protest against this sudden u-turn by the Government. Even though their numbers are small, a large outflux of German money caused by their distrust of the Government could be catastrophic for our economy.\n\nVan Severen has proposed a very drastic plan which would allow us to seize the Flemish-Walloon holdings of Germans in the event of revolt or mass-evacuation. It's clear that such bold plans to combat capital flight would provoke severe hostility from the Fatherland and especially amongst our own German population."

bel.843.b:0 "Allow Van Severen to go ahead."

bel.844.t:0 "German Capital Flight and Emigration"
bel.844.d:0 "Due to not letting Van Severen handle the situation, many of the richer Germans who benefited greatly from our favouritism policy, large sums of money are leaving the country. We can introduce a small tax cut for these upper class citizens to make them more likely to stay."
bel.844.a:0 "Propose the tax cut."

bel.849.t:0 "Reform the Voting System"
bel.849.d:0 "To further consolidate his power, the king has decided to reverse the universal suffrage that was only recently introduced in Flanders-Wallonia. As such his commands will be unchallenged as only the most loyal of his subjects will have their voting rights preserved. Advisers in the Government however have suggested that the king should not take such drastic action and instead should merely 'influence' the results of the elections."

Voices in Parliament and on the streets are asking however that the king allows for regulated festivities in villages and cities to lift the spirits in these times of crisis. This kind of action would greatly boost the king's standing in Flanders-Wallonia, but would probably be unacceptable to the German government."

bel.84.b:0 "Allow for small regulated gatherings in the cities."
bel.84.c:0 "The population can express themselves as they desire."

bel.85.t:0 "The Status of Syndicalism"
bel.85.d:0 "With the syndicalist party growing in popularity among the populace due to the unemployment crisis, it may be time for us to allow them to send representatives to Parliament to express their wishes. Even though the German Empire has expressed their hostility towards the party, they are clearly connecting to many of our citizens' concerns and may have a valuable opinion. This action might also further evolve our government into a more democratic system."
bel.85.a:0 "Allow all opposition parties a fair chance in elections"
bel.85.b:0 "Let the syndicalists organise and form their own commmunes."
bel.85.c:0 "The system will remain as it is."

bel.86.t:0 "The Language Question"
bel.86.d:0 "Flanders-Wallonia is a very divided country due to communication difficulties. The French upper class had always governed the country prior to the post-Weltkrieg Occupation and many have always regarded French as the proper language of state. The military also suffered heavily during the Weltkrieg from this divide, with French-speaking officers being unable to communicate with their Flemish subordinates. The Flemish people have always found themselves to be misrepresented by these French aristocrats and these tensions have led invariably to a certain hostility between the two groups.\n\nWith the arrival of the German occupation there have been some improvements made towards harmonising relations between the Walloons and the Dutch speaking communities. Unfortunately many perceive that the pro-German regime have done little more than replace the former French-speaking elite, and have created another form of hierarchy wherein both communities rank below the Germans invaders. The situation has changed however, and because of the large scale reforms of the military the time has come to consider improving national unity by allowing soldiers and politicians from all three languages to climb up the ranks."
bel.86.a:0 "Allow only German Officers."
bel.86.b:0 "Allow German and Flemish Officers."
bel.86.c:0 "Allow German, Flemish and Walloon Officers."

bel.87.t:0 "German Army Demands Food"
bel.87.d:0 "Due to a particulary bad harvest and the increased maintenance cost of the German army resulting from its massive expansion, the German government has openly demanded that the agriculturally rich region of Flanders sends large supplies of grain and potatoes to Germany to feed their soldiers. Coincidentally, Flanders has also experienced a poor harvest this year and complying with all German demands may cause a famine to erupt in our own country. Though we could decide to prioritise our own countrymen, the German government would greatly disapprove and may penalise us with economic sanctions."

bel.91.t:0 "평범한 대독 관계"

#Introduction
bel.94.t:0 "Status Report: Location of Flanders-Wallonia"
bel.94.d:0 "Located on the western border of the German Empire and bordering the Commune of France, Flanders-Wallonia has a very strategic but vulnerable position. As the vanguard of the West against the Syndicalist menace we are supposed to stop their advance on the bunkers of the Ludendorfflinie and push together with our German allies into the French heartland. To the east the German behemoth watches us closely and will prove to be a difficult enemy should the need arise. North of us lies the Netherlands: neutral in the Weltkrieg, our former masters don't seem much of a threat with their ill-equipped army and friendly relations."
bel.94.a:0 "Okay."

bel.95.t:0 "Status Report: Economy of Flanders-Wallonia"
bel.95.d:0 "Occupation and major battles during the first Weltkrieg have clearly marked our country and hefty reparations and general dismantlement of our industrial base imposed on us have left us weak. What was once the eighth greatest industrial power in the world has been greatly humbled. Still, our people are sturdy and managed to rebuild our industrial might to a level approaching its former extent. However as much of our industry is hopelessly reliant on German investment there remains a great deal of work to be done.\n\nIn order to reinvigorate the economy, the Adelbert Canal was dug post-war connecting the important harbour of Antwerp with the steel industries of Liège. Coal mining has been expanded into the province of Limburg further stimulating the steel industry while the Flemish provinces have steadily developed their industrial power to partially replace the old reliance on the agricultural countryside."
bel.95.a:0 "Okay."

bel.96.t:0 "Status Report: Political Situation in Flanders-Wallonia"
bel.96.d:0 "Even though our country is a constitutional monarchy on paper, parliamentary control over the Government is severely hampered. Moreover, political parties can only have a legal status and participate in elections if they accept the post-Weltkrieg status quo such as the Hohenzollern Monarchy, membership in the Reichspakt and other national indignities. This limitation makes legal opposition parties stunted and ineffective. The government is advised by the Flemish Council which consists mainly of members of the higher class, most of whom support the king and execute his decisions with limited practical power of veto.\n\nThere are two major opposition groups that seek to contest the current status quo and as a result have been forced underground. First we have the royalist Catholic Party who seeks to restore Belgium and its rightful king Albert I, currently in exile in Canada. The other large group is the Syndicalist party which seeks to improve working conditions and create a socialist regime like that which exists in the Commune of France. Both of these groups have stronger ties to the Wallonia region with occasional frictions. The Catholic Party is also however widely accepted in the agrarian region of Flanders which still strongly holds on to the Catholic faith."
bel.96.a:0 "We must brace ourselves for the trials to come."

bel.99.a:0 "We are disappointed by their foolish mistake."

bel.100.t:0 "Belgium Asks to Join the Entente"
bel.100.d:0 "A diplomatic mission from the reborn country of Belgium has approached us. They have reminded us of the Treaty of London and the strength of the Anglo-Belgian alliance for which we fought for in the Weltkrieg.

On that day an inferior Flemish army, supported by troops from Namur, defeated the far superior French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience.

The 21st then marks the day on which while on the Koningsplein in Brussels Leopold was sworn in as the first Belgian king, beginning our monarchy. This date was later proclaimed as the national holiday and is typically marked by widespread outpouring of patriotic tendencies.

After coordinated strikes by The Independence Army on the cities of Mons and Antwerp, they were finally able to push the Flemish-Walloon army back to Brussels where after fierce fighting the German king surrendered.

#Protest Agressive Further reaction
flawa.2.t:0 "Geuzengroep Uncovered"
flawa.2.d:0 "During a routine patrol by our Antwerp Harbour Defence Force, they uncovered a group of five men trying to infiltrate the Hansa Dock. Quick action by our troops meant they were able to capture the group, killing one man and disarming the rest. They carried small pistols designed for the Vlaamse Wacht and seemed to have intended the sabotage of the harbour trains, which would have disrupted vital shipping for the German Empire.\n\nUpon further investigation three of the four men have been discovered to be officers of the Deurne Police, thus invoking the question of whether we can trust our own police forces. The Ministry of Defence has responded forcefully to this implication, stating that only a full overhaul of the selection and training programme of the police can prevent further trouble. Others however believe this might be going too far. How should we respond to the situation?"
flawa.2.a:0 "Slowly increase our safety checks."
flawa.2.b:0 "Completely overhaul the training process."

flawa.3.t:0 "Geuzengroep Suffers Losses"
flawa.3.d:0 "Due to the recent increase in background checks and close internal investigation into our police forces, we have been able to capture more than three hundred members of the Geuzengroep, thus greatly disrupting their capacity to damage our regime. King Adelbert himself has personally awarded the commander of the Vlaamse Wacht with a medal, rewarding his loyalty and dedication to defeating the enemies of Flanders-Wallonia."
flawa.3.a:0 "A great success for our repression policy!"

flawa.4.t:0 "Strikes in Ghent"
flawa.4.d:0 "After our heavy repression in February which involved dispersing protesters in the capital with brute force, many of the smaller actions throughout the country dissipated, fearing more bloodshed. However, to show the Government that they have not managed to completely extinguish the flame of resistance over thirty thousand farmers and workers from across Ghent province have entered the city and amassed in Kaiser Wilhelm square and the surrounding park.\n\nThe gathered assembly has been protesting heavily against the violent actions taken by the Flanders-Wallonia regime and the recent 'reforms' undertaken against the Flemish Council. The local Vlaamse Wacht is keeping a close eye on the protest to ensure that escalation like in Brussels is prevented."
flawa.4.a:0 "They have the right to protest."

Throughout the entire Sillon Industriel, workers will down their tools in order to celebrate the syndicalist holiday. Just like last year the date will be accompanied with marches through the cities of Namur and Liège publicly chanting the Internationale and engaging in other activities forbidden by the Government.\n\nWhile we could the marches go ahead peacefully, showing those who have not yet joined the movement that we can be tolerant of dissent, our German commanders have expressed their desire to act with heavy force destroying much of the movement in one large sweep."

The Vlaamse Wacht immediately returned fire and after a hail of bullets and blood, fifty-three strikers lay dead on the ground.\n\nIt has become clear that our Vlaamse Wacht is not at all prepared for dealing with this kind of insurgency and that we will need a large scale overhaul of the training process. Hendrik Elias, head of the Wacht, has suggested that boosting their numbers would be more than enough to solve the problems and will even result in more successful raids against the insurgents."

flawa.9.d:0 "In an unsurprising turn of events, Hendrik Elias has lost the race against the much more popular Alfred Vander Stegen, who has been congratulated by the sitting mayor for his victory. Stengen has announced his ambitions to usher in a new era of prosperity for the population of Ghent in these trying times. Hendrik Elias however has considered rejecting the results and is preparing to take action."

Dozens of citizens are even now still trapped in the wreckage, and the nation is in mourning. Parliament has already expressed its condolences alongside the families of the victims and the king is planning to give a speech on the radio later this afternoon.

Both men were immediately arrested and the Gendarmerie is investigating any links between the men and known resistance members."
flawa.12.a:0 "Let the secret police take care of this."

flawa.13.t:0 "More Intelligence on the Denderleeuw Crash"
flawa.13.d:0 "New information has been discovered about the recent collision concerning the identities of some of the passengers. It appears that Hendrik Elias, head of the Vlaamse Wacht, was supposed to take this particular train for a routine inspection in Bruges. He was however unable to come and thus never boarded the train. Many feel like this attack was targeted against the Vlaamse Wacht for siding with the German regime. It might be wise to integrate them into our main police force in order to avoid further catastrophe."
flawa.13.a:0 "Revoke some of the priviliges of the Vlaamse Wacht"
flawa.13.b:0 "We should not interfere with their affairs."

flawa.14.t:0 "Vlaamse Wacht Protests"
flawa.14.d:0 "Ever since the occupation of Belgium in the Weltkrieg, the Vlaamse Wacht have been the beneficiaries of a special status separating them from the main police force. They initially helped pacify the country during the Weltkrieg by promising the Flemish population independence and more rights for the Dutch language. However, when it became clear after the conflict that Belgium would be turned into a puppet state of Germany, public opinion quickly turned against them.\n\nWith many of the original Vlaamse Wacht force feeling abandoned by their leaders, large groups of men have deserted the corps. The remaining hardcore loyalists have since embraced their higher status and established themselves as a form of secret police dedicated to preserving the regime's survival. As such, with the king deciding to strip them of their power, many have angrily risen up and marched on Brussels to demand their rights and privileges back. Many fear retaliation by the resistance movement and are afraid that without the king's protection they will be severely punished."
flawa.14.a:0 "Our decision will stand."
flawa.14.b:0 "Allow them to rejoin the Rijkswacht/Gendarmerie."

flawa.15.t:0 "Retaliation Against the Vlaamse Wacht"
flawa.15.d:0 "It appears that the Vlaamse Wacht's fear was justified as in under ten days more than a dozen former members were found dead, likely assassinated in revenge for their actions against the resistance. We will have to be careful as it seems the resistance has definitely not been quelled completely."
flawa.15.a:0 "We will have to keep a close watch on the situation."

flawa.16.t:0 "Vrij België"
flawa.16.d:0 "During a small raid in Ghent by the Vlaamse Wacht, hundreds of newspapers under the name'Vrij België', or Free Belgium, were found and taken into possession. Even though this raid may have slowed down the spread of the newspaper temporarily, the flame of revolution definitely still burns and action will have to be taken."
flawa.16.a:0 "Nicely done."

flawa.17.d:0 "Due to the abolition of our Flemish secret police force, it appears that the spread of illegal propaganda has increased. The Rebels may have the possibility now to further expand their movement and we will have to exoend more of our own resources to suppress the movement."
flawa.17.a:0 "More overtime for our police!"

flawa.18.t:0 "Smuggling Operation Discovered in Ghent"
flawa.18.d:0 "During a routine inspection by the police around Gent-Sint-Pieters station in Ghent, an unidentified train wagon was found containing military supplies. With all weapons and equipment stripped of any discernible markings, it has been difficult to identify their origin. Still, many inside the corps suspect they may originate from the Commune of France to our south. Other suspects include the Dutch who may be trying to reinstate their kingdom by liberating Flanders. We can't however make false acusations, and so we will have to choose which nation to confront over this issue."
flawa.18.a:0 "This is clearly done by the Syndicalist rabble!"
flawa.18.b:0 "Bring me the Dutch ambassador, he will have to explain this!"

flawa.19.t:0 "Audience with the French Envoy"
flawa.19.d:0 "The representative from the Commune has been called to the palace and after a short interrogation has denied all accusations. He warned us however that increasing our border forces could lead to unwanted escalations and advised us to drop the matter."
flawa.19.a:0 "Who does this Frenchman think that he is?"

flawa.20.t:0 "Audience with the Dutch Ambassador"
flawa.20.d:0 "The Dutch ambassador has been called to the palace and even though a short interrogation did not give us the answers that we sought for, the ambassador has promised us that they will tighten their border security to make sure that no weapon shipments or other illegal goods are able to enter our country from their border."
flawa.20.a:0 "Well alright then."

flawa.21.t:0 "Breakthrough in the Investigation"
flawa.21.d:0 "When investigating the military budget for last year, a lot of small unidentified expenses have been discovered. The puchase of a shipment of weapons from the German Empire, support equipment from Swiss and even an armoured convoy from the Netherlands. When verifying the destination of this equipment all signs point to the Leopoldskazerne in Ghent. This barracks has however not been used since 1933 when it was transformed into a hospital. It is as of yet unclear who authorised the purchases but the main suspects are low ranking members of the Flemish Council who may be aiding the rebels."
flawa.21.a:0 "Continue the investigation."

flawa.22.t:0 "The Investigation Comes Up Short"
flawa.22.d:0 "After carefully following every lead, we have yet to get the results we hoped for. Some members of the Council have been interrogated and even though some may have connections with the resistance, there is no clear evidence. While we can continue to let the secret police carry on focussing on this issue, for the time being no culprit has been discovered."
flawa.22.a:0 "Leave no stone unturned!"
flawa.22.b:0 "Call this pointless investigation off."

flawa.23.t:0 "Major Flemish Conspiracy Discovered"
flawa.23.d:0 "The head of the task force aimed at uncovering the Flemish Conspiracy has returned with results. It seems that the shipments directed to the Leopoldskazerne originate from a high level circle within the Flemish Council. Frans van Cauwelaert has been identified as the head of this secretive body and has seemingly been responsible for much of the unrest and dissent arising in Flanders-Wallonia since the Weltkrieg. It appears that members of the Council have tried to shuffle funds into Resistance hands by ay of infiltrators in the Postal Service. They were also able to spread their propaganda by the same means and have been secretly organising rallies and meetings discussing the liberation of both Belgium and Flanders."
flawa.23.a:0 "Firmly root out this weed!"

flawa.24.t:0 "Van Cauwelaert On the Run"
flawa.24.d:0 "With a warrant for his arrest signed by the king himself, police forces surrounded van Cauwelaert's home in Brussels seeking to capture him. He must have been warned in advance however, as all they found was an empty house and a smouldering fireplace. Police and Feldgendarmerie are organising a manhunt to quickly put an end to his treason and forces across the country are mobilising."
flawa.24.a:0 "Find him quickly!"

flawa.25.t:0 "Van Cauwelaert Caught!"
flawa.25.d:0 "After only a few days police have finally caught up with van Cauwelaert as the treasonous figure sought to cross the French border near the village of Paradijs. With the capture of such a high level member of the resistance we may finally be able to strike a blow back."

flawa.27.t:0 "란트바흐트의 결성"
flawa.27.d:0 "After his banishment from the Flemish Council, Van Severen has slowly been gathering support in the Flemish cities in the north. He has managed to create a cult of personality around himself with a strong focus on militarism.

These leftists were met by a prepared group of the Landwacht who began clashing with them, before forces of the Vlaamse Wacht finally broke up the fight. The incident has proven that the group is becoming increasingly dangerous and that a quick resolution of the situation is vital for national stability. Hendrik Elias has offered to integrate them into the Vlaamse Wacht since they are clearly anti-syndicalist and could prove more loyal soldiers in violent dispersements of syndicalist strikers."

Sick of German tyranny, Flemish nationalists have slowly been expanding their influence as of late - and after recent measures by the king they have finally seen an opportunity to execute their plans.\n\nWith orders from Van Severen and other members of the Council, at around 12:47 PM members of the Vlaamse Wacht departed their Brussels barracks in lorries. A first detachment was deployed and rushed towards the federal Parliament which was in session. By quickly overwhelming the security guards the putschists were able to establish a fortified position in the building and hold many parliamentarians hostage.\n\nAnother detachment headed straight for the royal palace, and by ramming the front gate with a special lorry they managed to storm it. Overwhelming the royal guard, they were able to secure the building. With one swift and powerful strike, the Government has been completely paralysed."
flawa.29.a:0 "Oh..."

flawa.30.t:0 "Regime Forces React"
flawa.30.d:0 "After the initial shock wore off, German and regime troops from the army barracks situated around the city mobilised and rushed towards the centre. Upon arrival they were met with fierce resistance from elements of the underground movement which saw an opportunity and helped execute the coup. With regime forces unable to reach the palace in time, Vlaamse Wacht quickly managed to breach the last line of defence and poured into the royal dining room. There they met Adelbert, still enjoying his soup and completely unaware of the situation.\n\nHendrik Elias, head of the Vlaamse Wacht has proposed an ultimatum to the king: that either he abdicates voluntarily as ruler of Flanders-Wallonia and stays as a hostage until arrangements with the German Empire have been made, or that alternatively he signs a decree ending his influence in Flemish-Walloon politics."

We have the opportunity now to right the wrongs of the Weltkrieg and all of the regime's excesses over the past twenty years, inflicting upon the occupiers and their lackeys a brutal humiliation.

A grand coalition of the BWP, KB and LP is organising themselves in an effort to oppose Van Severen, and it has been claimed that they can call on the tacit support of a vengeful Germany."

flawa.33.t:0 "Landwacht Coup"
flawa.33.d:0 "In an effort to make sure that their leader Van Severen remains in power, the Landwacht has launched a counter-coup against the democratic forces. Clashes between the two factions are erupting throughout the nation and the last remnants of order are breaking down."

flawa.34.t:0 "Deffontaine Takes Control of the Government"
flawa.34.d:0 "In an effort to restore order to the nation, Deffontaine has seized control and ordered his troops to disperse the heavy fighting in the cities.

flawa.35.t:0 "The Flemish Council Proclaims the Duchy of Flanders!"
flawa.35.d:0 "In a last ditch effort to secure their power over the Flemish region before Adelbert finally disbands them, the Council taken the bold step of unanimously declaring Flanders independent from the union. Though they have the backing of the hard-line flamingants and some detachements of the Vlaamse Wacht, they could be fairly easily be crushed by the full might of the German Empire. We could however recognise their decision as legitimate and grant them self-governance in our union."

flawa.37.t:0 "Flemish Council Takes Control"
flawa.37.d:0 "With Adelbert's signature on the bill, he has been rendered constitutionally powerless and incapable of acting as little more than a figurehead for the nation. While the Flemish Council has now secured all but total control over the nation, they still have a long road ahead of them to convince the populace of their good intentions. A good step in that direction would be restoring free elections, allowing all parties to have a say in Parliament. However, fervent nationalists and Dietsland proponents in the Council are opposed to the idea, suggesting that this could lead to a rise in syndicalist popularity which would endanger their positions."

While it is unclear yet if they are planning to 'reform' the state into a syndicalist bastion like in the neighbouring Commune of France, or just to pass progressive legislation, we have the possibilty to pre-emptively intervene and restore Adelbert to power using our forces stationed in the country."

flawa.43.d:0 "Organised by the resistance and members of all the major parties, a referendum calling for the independence of Belgium has been prepared in secret after repeated protests and rallies had no influence on the king. While they don't believe that their action will successfully convince the German government to grant Belgium its independence, they hope to convince foreign powers to intervene on their behalf. Syndicalists, both in the Commune of France and the Belgian resistance, anxiously await the inevitable German response as a denial of the referendum is likely to strengthen their position in the divided nation."

flawa.44.t:0 "The Belgians Demand Independence"
flawa.44.d:0 "It appears that tensions in neighbouring Flanders-Wallonia have finally come to a head. Our puppet regime in the country has failed to properly stamp down on dissent against our rule, and now an unofficial referendum organised by the Belgian resistance, all major political parties and other opposition figures has embolded its population, turning them against our rule. They are now openly calling for us to grant them independence, most likely hoping that international pressure will force us to accede to their request. Though we could obviously refuse this audacious demand, doing so could embolden Syndicalist elements of the resistance and push the nation towards the Communards."

This morning however, the De Standaard newspaper published a front page article detailing high ranking corruption within the institution. A number of major Catholic members and German industrialists are mentioned by name, while 파울 반 젤란트, the head of the Catholic Party, has been publicly accused of being responsible for the corruption infesting the organisation..."

flawa.52.d:0 "With a search warrant signed directly by Adelbert I himself, a strike force of the Feldgendarmerie has been ordered to storm the Generale Bank in a dawn raid and secure all documents and key personnel for the investigation. While the Gendarmerie successfully confiscated hundreds of documents, the Bank's ovens were conveniently putting in overtime in an effort to try and destroy as much evidence as possible. By the evening ten large trucks drove out of the building transporting all evidence to the palace."

flawa.53.d:0 "With full chaos enulginf the Catholic Party, whose members are desperately trying to close ranks and shun all members implicated in the scandal, Gustave Sap has openly called out Louis Franck, head of the Generale Bank, for his participation in the corruption. As he painfully details all his mistakes with what some call insider knowledge, Franck's reputation was completely devastated causing him to walk out in the middle of Sap's humiliating speech."
flawa.53.a:0 "The house of cards is falling down."

flawa.54.t:0 "더만 Frames the Catholic Party for the Black Monday schandal"
flawa.54.d:0 "In the socialist paper Vooruit!, Hendrik 더만 has joined Sap's commitment to bringing down Louis Franck and Van Zeeland. While 더만 has lambasted Van Zeeland for his failures in the Black Monday crisis, he has called Franck a despicable lapdog of the German aristocracy driven soely by profit and responsible for the oppression of Flemish workers."
flawa.54.a:0 "Franck's reputation is completely ruined!"

flawa.55.t:0 "Louis Franck Commits Suicide"
flawa.55.d:0 "Increasing pressure from all sides and the German investigation into his tenure as director of the Generale Bank have taken their toll on Louis Franck who commiyted suicide yesterday evening. He was found next to his service weapon from the Weltkrieg and dressed in full uniform, with a note on his nightstand detailing the roles of all persons implicated in the scandal. With this last act, he hopes to have done the right thing for his fatherland and that his relatives will be spared from his shame. Already the Feldgendarmerie have been deployed en-masse to imprison the many wretches Franck has implicated."
flawa.55.a:0 "With this last act, he has regained some measure of honour."

flawa.56.t:0 "Adelbert Accuses the Council"
flawa.56.d:0 "With the arrests of any prominent members of the Flemish Council, Adelbert has pointed out the widespread corruption and treachery of the body and its danger to the goal of securing a safe and free Flanders-Wallonia. Police forces and the Investigation Committee are following the crisis closely, trying to root out the deeply embedded malfeasance we have now discovered lying beneath the surface of many national institutions."
flawa.56.a:0 "The Council is clearly outliving its usefulness..."

flawa.57.t:0 "Creation of the Rijkswacht"
flawa.57.d:0 "With the Feldgendarmerie pleading loyalty to Adelbert himself and the Vlaamse Wacht under Council administration, the Government has voted for the creation of the Rijkswacht to fulfil the roles of the Vlaamse Wacht and to secure a more apolitical police force."
flawa.57.a:0 "Another the blow to the Council."

flawa.59.t:0 "Cooperative Vooruit Presses for BWP membership"
flawa.59.d:0 "While the first elections since the Weltkrieg have been planned for 1938 due to Adelbert's recent reforms, the BWP or Belgian Workers Party is still forbidden from partaking due to the fear of socialism spreading amongst the common man. To protest this decision, 더만 and the cooperatives are pressing their members to go on the streets and protest against this injustice. They also have been calling for all citizens to vote 'none of the above' if the elections do move ahead without them."
flawa.59.a:0 "The BWP has fed greedily off Black Monday's embers."

flawa.60.t:0 "French Agitators Captured in Charleroi"
flawa.60.d:0 "After a strike in the Charleroi industrial region, multiple French citizens were picked out of the Walloon crowd and identified as Communard syndicalists.

flawa.60.a:0 "Arrange an audience with 더만"

flawa.61.t:0 "Royal Audience with 더만"
flawa.61.d:0 "Due to the Charleroi strikes and the subsequent arrests of multiple French syndicalist agitators, Adelbert has decided to tackle the problem headfirst and has arranged a meeting with leader of the BWP, Hendrik 더만. While the king is reluctant to allow the BWP participation in the upcoming elections, 더만 promised has him that only through a strong, centralised social democrat leadershi can be Flanders-Wallonia be saved from falling to extremism."

To fulfil the quotas imposed by the regional industrial head, many of the workers have been forced to work seven days a week, some for over twelve hours a day, or risk losing their jobs. The cooperative of Zolder has decided to take action and has prepared a large strike to fight against their conditions and has sworn to uphold the strike until their terms are met."

bel.226.d:0 "On the 22nd of January 1935 the country was devastated by the killing of Albert Pot en Theofiel Grijp, two prominent members of the Antwerp union, by affiliates of a German shipping company. This resulted in a nation wide strike organised by the BWP, the local Cooperatives and the Unions to force the Government into signing a law ensuring better working conditions and the introduction of the forty-hour work week.\n\nThe government however decided to fight back against the strike with force leading to six casualties in the Ghent harbour and the imprisonment of over three hundred union members in the following weeks. Ultimately the strike was lifted as organising members were locked up or threatened into submission.\n\nToday the cooperative of Ghent has requested that the mayor of the city allow them to organise a small ceremony in Sint-Baafs Cathedral commemorating the sacrifices of their members."

#Linguistic Troubles resolvement

belind.1.t:0 "The First Talentelling"
belind.1.d:0 "Even though Belgian independence has once again been secured, linguistic issues dominate the political landscape. To make matters worse, due to the German push for integration, none of our demographic statistics remain valid. Therefore the Government has proposed a full census of the population to determine which villages and cities speak which language. With the results of this 'Talentelling' Brussels hopes to determine the exact location of the language border and solve the linguistic debacle."
belind.1.a:0 "Start the count."

belind.2.t:0 "Results of the Talentelling"
belind.2.d:0 "After weeks of counting, the commission responsible for the Talentelling has finalised their report and sent it to Parliament. The results are far from shocking with huge majorities of French being spoken in Wallonia and Dutch in Flanders respectively. The largest anomalies are the French speaking, Flemish town of Moeskroen and the Brussels capital region. Due to the influence ofthe German puppet government and the dominance of the Flemish Council, the city of Brussels has almost completely stopped its Frenchification and has experienced the creation of a large German minority. To solve the issues created by German interference and the pre-existing tensions, the Government is considering the creation of a so-called Language Commission which would be tasked with solving the crisis."
belind.2.a:0 "Create the Language Commission."
belind.2.b:0 "Belgium has more important issues!"

belind.3.t:0 "Status of the German Minority"
belind.3.d:0 "German influence in Flanders-Wallonia and the integration plans of Adelbert have dramatically increased the number of German speakers, who have become too large a minority to ignore. On the eastern side of Liège and the city of Brussels especially their influence is extremely tangible and the regions are currently undergoing protests, leading to serious tensions with the Flemish and Walloon populace. The German minority request that German is recognised as an official language and that the German community is granted their own measure of autonomous government. If we give in to their requests, this could lead to tensions in Flanders where separatism is still standing strong."
belind.3.a:0 "Ignore the German plea."
belind.3.b:0 "Look into creating Language Communities."

belind.4.t:0 "Defining the Language Border"
belind.4.d:0 "Currently our language border is just an abstraction and does not have any importance. Due to the mixed populations on the border though, many feel left behind due to the monolingual facilities. In a Walloon town in Henegouwen bordering East-Flanders, all forms of law and government are solely in French which proves problematic for the Flemish minority living in the same town. Therefore, a system where Flemish citizens can request to have their official correspondance and facilities in Flemish has been proposed. While overhauling the language border would be a costly affair, it would greatly help our citizens living on the border."
belind.4.a:0 "Hold on to the monolingual system."
belind.4.b:0 "Create bilingual facilities for those affected."

belind.5.t:0 "Adaption of the Provincial Borders"
belind.5.d:0 "As indicated by the Talentelling, many towns on the language border are currently placed in the wrong province. Towns like Komen and Orroir have a French majority of over 80% but are located in Flemish provinces. To complete the transfer of these communities, consent will have to be given from the Federal government in Brussels."
belind.5.a:0 "Transfer the towns."

belind.6.t:0 "브뤼셀 진군"
belind.6.d:0 "In protest against the recent transfer of villages, large groups of Flemish speaking citizens have come down to the capital protesting against what they see as state encroachment on the Flemish language. They argue that while Flemish citizens who migrate to Wallonia adapt themselves to the French language, Walloons insist on speaking the French language. This leads to rising Walloon minorities in the Flemish region of the language border, pushing the border north. The demands of the Flemish movement are clear: no further Talentellings, complete abolishment of the facility communities around Brussels, Flemification of industry and the creation of a separate Flemish government."
belind.6.a:0 "Make small concessions to calm the protestors."
belind.6.b:0 "Give in to their demands."

belind.7.t:0 "제2차 브뤼셀 진군"
belind.7.d:0 "Discontented with the passive reaction from the Government, the Flemish movement has organised a second March on Brussels. Even though most of the established parties were against such a radical provocation against Brussels, the Flemish nationalists have insisted on the protest further cementing their popularity. With counter protests from the Francophone movement as well, it looks like Brussels will have no choice but to move forward with decentralisation efforts."
belind.7.a:0 "Start the Government reform."

belind.8.t:0 "Split of the Communities"
belind.8.d:0 "Pressured by movements from all three language groups, Brussels has gone ahead with the Community program. Three separate autonomous governments will be created: a Flemish government, a French government and a German government who will each have the power to decide matters of education and culture within their jurisdiction. Brussels will be jointly controlled by all three of these governments, each serving the speakers of the language they represent. Included with the proposal is the Community 'alarm' procedure, a legislative process ensuring that no single Community can enact a reform which would damage other Communities. While this move has seriously fractured the power of the federal government and strengthened the Flemish nationalists, it seems that the majority of the population is content with the new reform and is looking forward to the first Community elections."
belind.8.a:0 "The first state reform is a fact."

belind.9.t:0 "Split of Brabant"
belind.9.d:0 "As the only Belgian province where both Walloons and Flemish live together split along the language border, the Government has proposed cutting the province in two along this border to simplify the work of the Language Communities. Walloon-Brabant would be governed from the city of Wavre, while Flemish-Brabant would be administered from Leuven. The city of Brussels, while being located in the middle of the province, would become its own entity and be wholly a part of the Brussels Region."
belind.9.a:0 "Split Brabant."
belind.9.b:0 "Keep Brabant intact."

belind.10.t:0 "Split of the Regions"
belind.10.d:0 "Due to the declining importance of Walloon industry, increasing pleas from Walloon industrialists backed by their German counterparts have been received by the federal government. They request that just like the cultural split into Communities, another split be made based on economic regions. The creation of the Regions, which would consist of Flanders, Wallonia and the Brussels Capital Region would once again bring the decision making process closer to the people. The cost for sustaining such a large bureaucratic state with seven different governments would be enormous and further consideration of this proposal may be in order."
belind.10.a:0 "Refuse their requests."
belind.10.b:0 "Delegate the responsibilities to the Communities."

belind.11.t:0 "리에주의 반발"
belind.11.d:0 "While the Flemish Community has agreed with the Federal Government and accepted their request to unify the Flemish Region and the Flemish Community, the French Community has refused these demands and has found support from the Walloon population in doing so. They insist that cultural and economic tasks need to stay seperated and that they cannot help the French-speaking citizens of Brussels without this split. It may be worth it for us to consider their opinion to retain control over Wallonia but the increased cost of sustaining both these government organs should be considered as well."
belind.11.a:0 "Force the Walloon Region and French Community to combine."
belind.11.b:0 "Preserve both separate governments."

belind.16.t:0 "Friction in the NMBS"
belind.16.d:0 "Uproar was caused today when a Flemish nationalist got into a fight with train personnel in Brussels. The man refused to answer the French speaking conductor unless he spoke Flemish, saying that in Belgium all people have to speak both languages and not just the Flemish. This is yet another incident in the rising tensions between Flemish and Walloons."
belind.16.a:0 "Investigate the issues."
belind.16.b:0 "Ignore the matter."

belind.17.t:0 "Strikes in Antwerp"
belind.17.d:0 "Due to protest instigated by last week's scandal, Antwerpen-Centraal has been blocked off by Flemish strikers. They demand an obligatory language examination for all Walloon personnel willing to work in Flanders. No reaction has been given by the NMBS leadership, as the state company awaits a reaction from the federal government."
belind.17.a:0 "Push for a bilingual examination."
belind.17.b:0 "Let the NMBS handle this on their own."

belind.18.t:0 "Clashes in Brussel"
belind.18.d:0 "Another clash between Flemish protesters and the Rijkswacht has occured in Brussels today when a large protest against the economic policy of Belgium came into contact with the Brussels police forces. Multiple protesters were beaten up by the police and even though no fatalities were reported, the Volksunie is out for blood."
belind.18.a:0 "A sad day for all Belgians."

belind.19.t:0 "The Volksunie Speaks Out Against the Economic Policy"
belind.19.d:0 "Due to the collapse of large parts of Walloon industry and increasingly commercial focus on Flanders, it has become clear to many that Wallonia has become the lesser partner in the union. To remedy this, the federal government has authorised large transfers of subsidy and investments into the Sillon Industriel to help the Walloons recover. The Volksunie is now proclaiming that if they win the elections, these transfers will be completely cut and fully used to aid Flanders. This has caused heavy outrage from the BWP who has accused the Volksunie of being asocial and detrimental to Belgian stability."
belind.19.a:0 "The Volksunie is becoming a threat."

belind.12.d:0 "In Ronse-Renaix, large protests have been organised by the Flemish Movement against the increasingly French speaking population. They fear that if Brussels does not intervene in the Language Crisis, the Flemish language will be pushed further north due to the migation and refusal to adapt of the Walloon populace. They argue that further consolidating of the educational department and equal enforcement of both languages on a national level should be top priorities for the Government if they wish to solve this crisis."
belind.12.a:0 "Overhaul the educational system."
belind.12.b:0 "Ignore Flemish protests."

belind.13.t:0 "The Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde Dossier"
belind.13.d:0 "Ever since the independence of Belgium, the province of Brabant has formed the center of our nation consisting of the Walloon majorities in the south, the Flemish majorities in the north and the divided region of Brussels in the middle of it all. Due to the Government's stubborness in keeping the province intact and the old electorial districts, protest in the region is mounting, urging Brussels to at least split up the province or adapt the Brussel-Halle-Vilvoorde region to the present situation."
belind.13.a:0 "Split Brabant."
