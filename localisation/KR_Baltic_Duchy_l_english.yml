### Sub-ideologies ###

BAT_social_liberal_subtype_desc:0 "발트 독일계 민주당은 성과주의적 자유주의라고 가장 잘 설명할 수 있는 파울 쉬만의 이념적 사상을 따릅니다. 종교, 국적, 사회적 지위에 관계없는 개인의 천부 인권과 기회의 평등을 숭배합니다. 그렇지만 이것이 결과의 평등이나 동등한 정치적 권리인 것은 아닙니다. 지배할 권리는 지배할 수 있는 장점과 능력을 가진 이들에게 있어야 하며, 교육을 받지 않은 개인은 본질적으로 그렇지 못한 하층민보다 더 많은 정치적 권리를 가져야 합니다. 성과주의적 자유주의는 모든 사회 단체와 정치 전문가들로 이루어진 정부를 통해 기업주의, 성과주의 체제를 구축하고자 하며 정부에게 계몽이라는 사명이 있음을 믿습니다. 정부의 목표는 자유롭고 교육적이며 문화적으로 계몽된 사회를 만드는 것이어야 하며, 그에 따라 누구에게나 성과주의적 등급을 통해 승진할 기회를 주어야 합니다."
BAT_national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "The Baltic Brotherhood follows its own firebrand ideology, an eclectic mutation of radical Christianity and Baltic German exceptionalism. It is a millenarian religious movement which proclaims a new reading of the Bible and calls for a restoration of Christian morality across all of Europe. In the Baltic German nation, it sees a history of religious warfare and stalwart faith, and so believes that their purpose is to champion this rebirth of Christianity in the face of Eastern and Syndicalist onslaught. Fanatically loyal to pan-Germanism, the Brotherhood believes that Germany's role should be to lead Europe in this crusade, and so its goal is to turn the Baltics into a model province for the 'National Revival', from where the flame can be brought to Germany. In practice, its regime is totalitarian, fanatically dedicated to Christian ideals, and heavily militaristic."

POLITICS_ADOLF_FRIEDRICH_DESC:0 "발트 연합공국의 최초이자 유일한 공작, 아돌프 프리드리히가 가보지 못한 장소를 찾기란 힘든 일입니다. 프로이센 흉갑기병대의 박식한 베테랑이자, 활기찬 사냥꾼이며, 무엇보다도 정열적인 카레이서인 그는 말과 도보를 통해 중동, 동아시아와 아프리카를 여행하며 평생을 보냈습니다. 특히 아프리카의 근사한 야생동물들은 그의 마음 속에 특별한 추억으로 남았습니다. 어쨌든 그는 아프리카를 동에서 서로 횡단하고, 탕가니카의 화산에 본인의 이름을 새겼으며, 세계대전 직전쯤에는 기어이 토골란트 총독 지위를 얻었습니다. 아돌프 프리드리히는 책상에 가만히 앉아있을 성격은 결코 아니었지만, 에웨어를 배우는 데 시간을 할애하기까지 하는 등 토고 원주민들의 삶과 문화에 큰 관심을 보였습니다.\n\n세계대전 말, 식민지 총독으로서의 경험과 독일 상류층 사이에서 그가 가진 높은 명성을 고려해, 아돌프 폰 필샤우의 섭정의회는 그를 발트 연합공국의 공작으로 선출했습니다. 작위를 수락한 아돌프 프리드리히는 1919년 봄 리가에 도착하였으며, 그곳에서 발트 귀족의 전통적인 명예와 특권을 수호하며 좋은 통치자가 되기 위해 힘쓰리라고 선언했습니다. 아돌프 프리드리히 공작은 예술, 과학, 스포츠를 즐기고 후원하며 대부분의 시간을 보내는 소극적인 군주입니다. 공국 전체를 통틀어 견줄 자가 없는 최고의 카레이서로 인정받았을 정도이니 말입니다. 그러나 오랜 세월 경험을 쌓아온 그는 뛰어난 정치적 통찰력을 가졌으며, 자신의 새로운 영역인 공국이 가진 약점을 인식하고, 개혁의 필요성을 피력하면서 더 자주 목소리를 내기 시작했습니다."

POLITICS_WILHELM_MUNTER_DESC:0 "Gotthard Wilhelm Nikolai Munter was born to a mixed Estonian-Baltic German middle class family in Riga, and grew up during the last days of the Russian Empire. Alongside the rest of the Riga Polytechnic, he was evacuated to Russia, and later recruited into the Imperial Russian Army. Inducted into the Cadet Corps, Munter was among the first to resist the October Revolution in Petrograd, but the sheer numbers of the revolutionaries proved too much to resist. The German soldier was imprisoned, but managed to escape through connections and escape to the Baltics, where he returned to German-occupied Riga. There, having finally found rest, Munter completed his studies in chemistry and applied to join the foreign office of the United Baltic Duchy. Throughout the post-Weltkrieg period, he became increasingly drawn to the Democratic Party and its reformist ideals, and though he never officially became a member, he became regarded as the leader of its liberal coalition in Riga.\n\nPersonality wise, Munter has been almost universally regarded as ambitious, unprincipled, and with an affinity towards intrigue. Lacking social tact and softness, he often considers sentiment to be foreign to him. To Munter, emotional people are weak, insignificant dreamers and everyone he meets can only be classified into two categories - those who are useful and those who are useless. His opponents are numerous, but even those who know him well doubt he has any friends at all."
POLITICS_SCHEUBNER_RICHTER_DESC:0 "Ludwig Maximilian Erwin Richter was born to a German musician in Riga, and added the second last name "Scheubner" after marrying into a family of Baltic German nobility and getting adopted by one of his wife's relatives, in an old German form of having one's lineage ennobled. Though he first lived in Russia, Scheubner-Richter ended up moving to Munich to complete his chemistry studies, and volunteered for the army of his new homeland when the Weltkrieg began. However, he did not serve on the front lines for long - once his superiors caught note of his Russian fluency, Scheubner-Richter was removed from the front and sent to the Ottoman Empire for a secret mission to infiltrate the Russian oil fields, under the guise of a consulate in Erzurum. Though the infiltration never took off, Scheubner-Richter witnessed the Armenian Genocide instead, and became one of the first to report about the atrocities, which he described as "a policy of annihilation fueled by racial hatred".\n\nScheubner-Richter returned to the Baltics a lieutenant and an officer in the Baltische Landeswehr, and retired from service in 1920 to settle in Riga, where he found work in the city press and maintained contact with his connections to both German and Baltic nationalists. To the dismay of his classmate Otto von Kursell, Scheubner-Richter did not end up involved in the Baltic Brotherhood, but the wartime years had turned him into just as much of a nationalist regardless. A conservative and a monarchist dismissive of democracy and vehemently against socialism, Scheubner-Richter calls in his "Deutschen Manifest" for the birth of a "new nationalism", one which is based upon the interest of the national community and one which will unite all Germans into one pan-Germanic state."

A descendant of a honored Prussian noble family with a history of military officers, von der Goltz had a long and bountiful career in the Imperial German Army even before the Weltkrieg, during which he was a division commander respected on the Western and Eastern Fronts alike. In 1918, he became the General Staff's primary asset in relations with its Eastern regions - early that year, he was sent to Finland as a representative of the German forces and promptly took control of the state as a dictator.

Thanks to this experience and clear loyalty to the German cause, he became one of the first members of the General Staff of the Baltische Landeswehr in November of 1918. An active, reckless leader, he commanded an elite unit of Weltkrieg veterans against the Estonian and Latvian rebellions, often leading his men from the front lines without an ounce of hesitation.\n\nBy the end of the war, Manteuffel's prestige among the Baltic Germans was untold and his status as a war hero cemented. Manteuffel himself took a lunge towards the far right, however. Invited by his brother Georg, a member of the organization's inner circle, he was inducted into the Baltic Brotherhood, and turned into a devout follower of its nationalist, pan-German, and reactionary beliefs.

KRBAT.1.d:0 "발트해 동부 연안에 위치한 발트 연합공국은 1918년 발트의 독일계 주민의 주도로 결성된 유럽에서 가장 동쪽에 위치한 독일계 국가입니다. 초기에는 독일 제국의 새로운 회원국으로 구상되었지만, 이러한 희망은 결국 좌절되었는데, 이는 세계대전 이후 유럽의 지정학적 현실과 압도적으로 다수인 라트비아와 에스토니아 현지인이 이러한 계획을 불가능하게 만들었기 때문이지, 발트의 독일인들 스스로가 그들의 조국으로서의 정체성을 잃고 싶지 않았던 것은 아니었습니다. 에스토니아 독립전쟁을 성공적으로 진압하고 라트비아 민족주의 운동의 내부 분열 덕분에 라트비아에서 이와 유사한 봉기를 막은 뒤, 공국은 그 자리를 굳혔고, 이는 이제 거의 20년의 역사가 되어가고 있습니다.\n\n발트 연합공국은 무엇보다도 전통에 뿌리를 두고 있습니다. 공국은 발트해 지방법, 란트탁(독일식 주의회)을 통한 대표 제도, 그리고 발트 기사단의 제도적인 역할을 리보니아 연방 시절의 것으로부터 계승하고, 이러한 전통은 독일계 발트의 정체성에서 큰 부분을 차지합니다. 발트해에서 가장 가난한 귀족들조차도 모든 지주들의 각각의 불만과 걱정거리에 귀 기울이는 공동체에 사는 것을 자랑스럽게 여기고 있으며, 귀족의 기사다운 전통을 무엇보다 가장 존중합니다. 그러나 실제로 이것은 공국이 비잔틴적 정부 체제로서 거의 기능하지 않는 국가라는 것을 의미하며, 앞으로의 닥쳐올 시련에 대해 전혀 준비가 되어 있지 않다는 것입니다..."

The world itself began to turn upside down - Bolshevism, Syndicalism and Latvian/Estonian nationalism all rose to shake their old way of life. Faced with all of this, many of them turned towards the Lutheran faith, their religious beliefs, joined by an unyielding anti-syndicalism and pan-Germanic nationalism, developed towards extremism. The Baltic Brotherhood was founded in 1928, by some of the most prominent members of the younger Baltic German generation, including Harald von Rautenfeld, Sylvester von Ropp, Georg and Hans von Manteuffel-Szoeges, and Otto von Kursell.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood was founded as a secret Christian fundamentalist and pan-German order, and remains such to this day. It is organized in Brotherly Rings, which operate in every major town of the Duchy and exist as a place for religious worship, common labor, and philosophical thought. The Brotherhood operates with a defined statute and a set of mandatory principles, including flawless trustworthiness, obedience to one's elder Brother, and chastity, among others. All members of the Brotherhood are divided into the Outer Ring, or Ring of Preparation and the Inner Ring. Advancing from the former to the latter is a considerable feat.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood is absolutely not a mass movement, but it maintains a great amount of influence within the government. Many of its members are high ranking members of the Knighthoods and representatives in the Landtag, of course, keeping their allegiance a secret. Among the Baltische Landeswehr, the Brotherhood's most ardent supporter is Hans von Manteuffel-Szoege, a member of its Inner Ring."

While not a noble himself, he came from a wealthy middle class Baltic German family, and was thus able to obtain a fulfilling education in Germany as well as officer military service in the Imperial Russian Army. Even before the Weltkrieg, he gained the notoriety of a bleeding-heart liberal, engaged in constant polemics with conservative Baltic German society, even ending up briefly expelled from Riga by the Livonian Knighthood in 1917. Upon returning to his homeland a year later, he founded the DbDP alongside Friedrich von Samson-Himmelstjerna to push for his vision of a liberal Baltic Federation.\n\nSchiemann is a committed liberal democrat, opposed to conservative nationalism and Syndicalism - the former for standing against everything liberalism fights for, and the latter for being an abnormal deformity of liberty, which denies individual personality in favor of uncultured mediocrity of the masses. His definition of liberalism is different from the West, however. Schiemann believes in abolition of privileges and the strength of individual merit, but not in universal political equality - to him, it is ridiculous to imagine a cleaning maid with the same political rights as a university professor. His political vision is corporatist and more akin to meritocracy than democracy - although, as he concludes, liberal democracy is a good method of finding 'the best men'. To him, it is the cultural mission of the Baltic Germans to teach these liberal ideas to the Latvian and Estonian masses.\n\nSchiemann's other major contribution is the concept of an anational state. Borrowing heavily from Austromarxism, Schiemann interprets ethnicity as a 'spiritual community', much like religion, and posits that nationalism must be separated from the state in the same way religion is - instead, all ethnic groups within a country must exist as voluntary communities defending the interests of their members. This anational statehood forms the basis of his Baltic Federation project."

Educated as a road construction engineer, he became a diplomat for the Imperial Russian diplomatic service, and spent twenty years of his life travelling across the planet as an envoy for two monarchies, first Russian and the Baltic - these travels saw him walk the streets of Constantinople, Paris, Lisbon and even Nagasaki, where he spent almost half a decade of his life. After visiting his distant cousin in Mongolia, a turn of events which the House of Ungern-Sternberg still finds hard to come to terms with, Rolf returned to his homeland, those two decades leaving him a changed man. The Baron has the stature and wit of an erudite, knows several languages and spends his free time writing poetry - but all of his experiences in the world only strengthened his belief that the traditions of the Baltic German peoples are exemplary and must be defended against liberal encroachment.\n\nBorn in 1885, Baron Adolf Constantin Theodor Pilar von Pilchau is the son of Adolf Pilar von Pilchau, the founding father of the Baltic Duchy, its first and longest lasting head of government. It is a fact which von Pilchau always mentions, it is the fact which propelled him to a political career in the Livonian Knighthood, and it is the fact which has built him into an arrogant, self-assured snob. Out of all the leaders of the Four Knighthoods, he is least afraid to use his power, assured that it cannot backfire against him and that the cause he fights for is right. Having supported his father's decision to banish Paul Schiemann in 1917, Pilchau sports a rivalry with him to this day."

The divided Landtag is being pressured by outside forces to act - the Landeswehr demands national unity in the face of crisis, and the Duke has stepped out ordering his government to seek a rapprochement with the right-wing opposition.\n\nThe leader of the Livonian Knighthood, Adolf Constantin Pilar von Pilchau, made his move first, reaching out to Chairman von Samson-Himmelstjerna directly and offering a deal he could not refuse. For the following two months, the Landtag will work together to pass laws necessary to restore order in the Duchy, and in exchange, both sides will forgo building up coalitions and alliances to take the other down for that time. Paul Schiemann demands his peers to seek no compromise, however - according to him, Pilchau and Sternberg will take advantage of the peace to scheme behind their backs and try to take down the government. And perhaps there is a reason to fear this, as Pilchau is definitely not the type of person to put country over party...\n\nOn the other hand, refusing the armistice and continuing the political brawl in the midst of a guerrilla war will not bode well for our nation's stability, nor will forces outside of the Landtag approve. Will von Samson-Himmelstjerna violate Schiemann's orders or will he put party above country?"

Unique between all countries in Europe, the Baltic Landeswehr is completely independent from the civilian government aside for a largely powerless Military Commission in the Land Administration - in fact, this arrangement was born out of a necessity, for the military could not afford to wait for orders from an incompetent, ancient government system. In this critical moment, this independence meant that the Landeswehr has turned into an enemy, not an ally, of the administration in Riga.\n\nThis anti-civilian authority fever has reached the supreme commander of the Landeswehr, Rüdiger von der Goltz, as well, and a salvation soon approached him in the form of the Baltic Brotherhood. Otto von Kursell's clandestine religious nationalist order spectated the events in the Landtag from the shadows and came to the same conclusion as the arch-conservative commander - that this decadent and self-destructive conflict needs to go. The Landtag, the Knighthoods, and the Duke who turns a blind eye to the chaos, all need to go - and to this end, von der Goltz and von Kursell have reached a secret agreement which will come into effect in the following days."

Rumors were spread of a Latvian militant uprising in Riga which the Landeswehr acted upon and sent designated units into the city - these units promptly disarmed the local garrison, seized control of all communications and surrounded the Landtag. One hundred and fifty members of the legislature and all members of the Convent of Land Administrators were left besieged, learning through secret channels that offices of the Four Baltic Knighthoods are being raided, martial law is being enacted across the country, and local civilian authorities are surrendering to military pressure. The whereabouts of Duke Adolf Friedrich are unknown.\n\nA few hours later, General von Manteuffel-Szoege presented his demands to the besieged Landtag - the dissolution of the legislature and the Convent of Land Administrators, to be replaced by a 'faithful and respected government', headed by Rüdiger von der Goltz as emergency Regent and Otto von Kursell as the new Chairman of the Convent. Fearing further repercussions, the majority of the Landtag voted to surrender, despite the resistance by members of the Riga Democratic Bloc, who have since been arrested for disturbing public order."

This would also keep the Baltic holdout in touch with the rest of the front and thus leave them open to reinforcements from the south.\n\nAn another faction has a different view of a possible Russian-Reichspakt War. Because of our fortifications on the eastern border, it is likely that the Russians will avoid a direct assault against them and instead strike southwards, through White Ruthenia and Lithuania, which these officers see as the weakest link. In such a situation, the Duchy will be isolated from the rest of the Reichspakt, and thus should hole up in cities such as Riga and Reval, where they can receive German support through the sea and hold up the Russians while the Empire's forces do battle in the south.\n\nWhich approach has more merit?"

A descendant of a honored Prussian noble family with a history of military officers, von der Goltz had a long and bountiful career in the Imperial German Army even before the Weltkrieg, during which he was a division commander respected on the Western and Eastern Fronts alike. In 1918, he became the General Staff's primary asset in relations with its Eastern regions - early that year, he was sent to Finland as a representative of the German forces and promptly took control of the state as a dictator. When that became untenable, he was reassigned to the Baltic duchy, where he laid down the foundations for the Baltische Landeswehr. The army of the Duchy owes everything to von der Goltz, and he knows that.\n\nAn aristocrat by blood and personality, the Graf has little patience for democracy and the squabbling liberals in the Landtag. While many of his fellow German veterans who helped found the Baltische Landeswehr ultimately returned to Germany, von der Goltz stayed, knowing that not only will the Duchy require his services yet again, but that he will be able to take advantage of the situation and finally rise beyond a mere chief of staff of the Landeswehr.

What's the point? It was a sentence which echoed often through the streets and halls of the city.

The rest of the novel is dedicated to a series of characters, all of whom try to solve the crime, fail, and attempt to please the Great Tyrant by accusing innocents of having committed the crime - all of these lies are seen through, however, and the roster of characters thins with each chapter. A court session is held at the end of the book, whereupon it is revealed that the Tyrant himself had ordered the monk murdered - he orders all the documents of the case to be burned and pleads for forgiveness.\n\nThe Baltic Brotherhood hails the novel as a great example of the sort of culture they wish to foster - noting the religious themes of the book and the larger-than-life standing of the Great Tyrant, including his turn to good and towards the Christian faith.

Instead, it stresses Jesus's actions as a preacher and fighter who sought to destroy institutional Judaism and bring forth salvation.\n\nThough officially the entirety of the nation has converted to the Brotherhood's interpretation of Christianity, the absolute majority of the population do not follow the guidelines set forth, and reject them either openly or secretly.

From their current location, they should head to Boyoma, formerly known as Stanleyville - the Congo River is the best natural highway for them to escape through, and before the expedition began, the Duke had contracted a Belgian shipping company in the city to lend them a boat with which they would be able to make their way to Kinshasa.\n\nThe other day after setting off from camp, the Duke learned from group of African patrols that Boyoma, as well as the entire eastern half of Congo, are under the control of Louis de Gonzague-Bobozo, an Askari officer who runs the Kivu Clique.

Turns out the men of the Kivu Clique were getting ready to requisition the ship already, and so the steamboat was now crawling with the warlord's soldiers. The orders of Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, came immediately - storm the ship, draw your weapons, and take out the enemy with as little sound as possible.\n\nEven if they only numbered a handful, that was more than enough to sweep the ship - professional and disciplined career soldiers stand head and shoulders above barely trained conscripts. The final kill came from the Duke's handgun, hitting the last African soldier in the neck and throwing the body overboard. As soon as the ship was cleared, the engine was fired up and the vessel took off from port.

The soldiers were ordered to take arms, pack all of their belongings and be ready for a skirmish while escaping the enemy forces - and then, the sound of a whistle reached them. A ship was approaching, the same one which the Duke had handpicked for his expedition months ago, and it was finally coming to he rescue.\n\nTurns out the businessman was held up by some soldiers trying to requisition the ship, but handily resolved the matter and was ready to lend it back to the Germans.

And, sure enough, they eventually found their target. In the depths of the Congo, the river is one of the few means of transportation available, and the Kivu clique put it to use - a ferry bringing several dozen conscripts from the northern villages passed by, making its way towards the capital of the clique. The number of men they'd have to deal with was intimidating at first, but the commander of the Duke's Landeswehr-Askari guard, Lieutenant Bernd von Freytagh-Loringhoven, bet on his chances.\n\nThe Lieutenant made the first shot, firing from the bushes and sniping the captain away, which immediately sent the ship into chaos. The few soldiers commanding the ship were not trained enough to deal with attacks from land while they're on the ship, so they made the fatal mistake of steering it closer to the coast in order to fire upon the attackers - which meant that, using makeshift rafts, the soldiers were able to board the ship and fight through the crew. Pretty much all of the fresh conscripts either surrendered or dove to the river immediately, while those fighting were easily eliminated by the Baltic German professionals. The final kill came from the Duke's handgun, hitting the last African soldier in the neck and throwing the body overboard.\n\nBy the time the morning arrives, the Kivu will be furious, but their target will have long since vanished."

In the living quarters of the ship, a map has been stretched, notebooks laid down where all the scraps of information about the Mittelafrika's collapse are marked, and their next move is being deliberated.\n\nMuch like in Boyoma, simply entering the city is out of question - the ship will be searched and taken hostage faster than they can say "how much is the ransom?". If they are careless, that is. Perhaps, if they hide everything unusual about the ship - the German passengers, the weapons and the uniforms - they can pass by as an inconspicuous local ship and get away with only a few questions. Alternatively, there is the option to not deal with the risk at all, bring the ship to land and try to carry it over several miles of jungle before plopping it down back in the Congo."

At night and during rain, the ship would serve as their shelter, and whenever the road becomes clear again, they'd move out and continue.\n\nIt was not as simple as initially anticipated, however. During the long march, the party had to escape and fend off several bands of brigands who would spot them and immediately get ready to engage. Whether they were associated with the warlord and his forces, the Germans and Askari had no chance to figure out, as they simply could not afford to stop and ask questions. All of them would soon regret their choice, anyway - as soon as they'd approach the party to extort tribute, they would see the supposedly helpless travellers reveal their hidden weapons and turn their ship into cover - the Landeswehr has faced off against this routine enough times during the Forest Brothers rebellion. Usually, just showing their teeth would be enough to get the brigands to flee.\n\nAfter reaching a safe enough spot downstream from Mbandaka, the party once again pushed the boat into the river and boarded it, setting off to the next stop in their journey."

As soon as he discovered the hiding European adventurers, Lieutenant von Freytagh-Loringhoven caught him and slit his throat before he could release a single yelp.

Hey, at least that means if he survives for long enough, he might eventually get home...\n\nBut when day once again changed to night, the cell's Askari guard spoke over the door - and the language was Ewe, native to Togoland, which the Duke had taken his time to learn when he served as the colony's governor.\n\nThe Askari introduced himself as Martin Aku - a Togolese native born in the colony during the Duke's time as governor, who travelled to Germany after the war, studied medicine, and finally travelled to Mittelafrika before being forcefully recruited into the Kongolese clique's army as a field medic. Much like the Duke, he wants to return to Europe, and so he offered to break the monarch out of imprisonment and pick him up with them.\n\nThem.

Kinshasa is a pretty big city, unfortunately, and the defectors were soon compromised by a dog barking next to a sleeping patrol - alerting them, causing panic, misunderstanding and finally a shootout.\n\nNot wishing to engage the warlord's soldiers and so lose the only chance they had to escape with their lives, Adolf Friedrich, Aku and the rest fled, not even bothering to fire back. At this point, however, the Kinshasa docks were already full of soldiers, all woken up and alerted by the ongoing fighting, and by the time the party stumbled into the series of customs houses, warehouses and docked ships which composed the port, there was no way out left.\n\nAt this critical moment, however, a door behind them cracked open, revealing a familiar, if battered face - with a partially ripped uniform and a rifle in his hand, Lieutenant von Freytagh-Loringhoven stood and waited for his Duke to follow.\n\n"Come with me if you want to live.""

There, he writes that the Baltic-German Democratic Party and its reforms are but an attempt by the bourgeoisie classes of the Duchy to prevent a revolution of the proletariat with soulless appeasement.

The Inner Circle of the Brotherhood has been gathered to deliberate upon the situation - a solution was found immediately. To ensure that everyone in the society gets their fair share, the government must take full control of the food supply in the Baltic state, to take from the people their agricultural surplus by force and distribute it to those who need it.\n\nThe issue comes on the means how this ideal will be implemented.

However, the aristocrat of the nationally revived Baltic State should have little in common with what the Brotherhood perceives to be "decrepit, corrupt, sycophantic landowners" of the decades before, who merely hoard the wealth of the land and waste it on luxury. As the propaganda machine claims, the Baltic German aristocrat earns his right to reign over his servants by being modest, prudent, devoutly Christian, and above all else, a noble "Wehrbauer" - an idealized image of a medieval German colonist in the East, able both to work the land and to defend it, not unlike the Ordensburgs of the Teutonic Order. A knight, defending his land and the peasantry which serves it, connected to the soil and the Nation he is a part of, for he has to protect it with his own arms - this is the ideal proclaimed by the Brotherhood.\n\nWith this goal in mind, the regime has embarked on a quest to dismantle and destroy the Landsgemeinde, replacing them with new estates drawn and land redistributed in favor of the Baltic Germans. These rural communes, democratic Latvian and Estonian peasant communities, would often resist the transformation by force, requiring Landeswehr intervention and often brutal measures to prevent the spread of unrest.

BAT_church_unity_desc:0 "Today, the Christian church is divided and relishes in infighting.

BAT_subsume_brotherhood:0 "발트 기사단 협회를 형제단에 포섭하라"
BAT_subsume_brotherhood_desc:0 "The Baltic Knighthoods have long since resisted the ultimate goal of the Baltic Germans.

BAT_conscription_squads:0 "징병부대"
BAT_conscription_squads_desc:0 "Not everyone in our country is willing to serve in the Landeswehr and fulfill their duty to the country. They defect, hide from the service, and find ways to excuse themselves. These stragglers must be found and forced to serve, if that's what is necessary."

BAT_landpolizeibehorden_desc:0 "The Landpolizeibehörden are the traditional law enforcement authorities of the Baltic region, subordinate to the legal system - aside from standard law enforcement duties, they oversee road construction, collection of statistical information, and other duties.

The Democratic Party lacks a majority in the Landtag and has no way of pushing through laws or projects, as they do not have legislative initiative or Landtag dissolution powers, but the conservative controlled Landtag has no way of removing the incumbent Convent from power, as that requires the assent of the Knighthoods and the Duke, not them. A power struggle has thus broken out within the upper echelons of government and needs to be resolved lest our country falls into anarchy.\n\nWhile §YDualism§! is active, it is impossible to gain £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! normally - it may only be gained through £decision_icon_small §YDecisions§!, in which you can make various concessions to parliamentary groups in order to receive their support.
