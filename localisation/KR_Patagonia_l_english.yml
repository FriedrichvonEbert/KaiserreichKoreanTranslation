Patagonia_Focus:0 "파타고니아 중점계통도"

### Starting Tree ###
FOP_the_revolutionary_fires:0 "혁명의 불꽃"
FOP_the_revolutionary_fires_desc:0 "Despite the attempts of the Argentinean government to quell the flames of revolution, our movement is still alive, and growing stronger by the day. While our victory is far from certain, we must start preparing for the final showdown against the reactionaries in the north."

FOP_the_three_main_issues:0 "3대 경제 사안"
FOP_the_three_main_issues_desc:0 "The Patagonian landscape has not been easy on our movement. We will need to be smart if we wish to prevail on the battlefield, and to prepare ourselves for it, we must first survey the issues that plague our local economy."

FOP_we_need_more_production:0 "무기 밀수"
FOP_we_need_more_production_desc:0 "파타고니아의 산업 혁명을 위한 첫 단계는 먼저 북쪽의 반동 세력으로부터 우리 스스로를 지킬 능력을 갖추는 것입니다. 그러나 현재 우리에게는 산업 기반을 구축하는 것조차 버거우므로, 해외에서 우리의 빈약한 자원으로 구할 수 있는 무기라면 무엇이든 찾아야만 할 것입니다."

FOP_adapt_the_fishing_industry:0 "파타고니아 어업"
FOP_adapt_the_fishing_industry_desc:0 "The sizable Atlantic fishing industry in Patagonia was effectively shuttered by the revolution. Before we can build a build a navy to defend our coasts, we must first help our fishermen reclaim the seas and restore Patagonia's mothballed merchant fleet. Above all else, this will help us feed both our people and our army."

FOP_prospect_for_resources:0 "자원 활용"
FOP_prospect_for_resources_desc:0 "The Patagonian economy is grievously underdeveloped with many of the region's riches being left trapped beneath the earth. There is no reason for this other than the neglect of the previous regime and now that we're in control of our own fate we'll have to jump-start a resource industry to support both our people and our revolutionary army."

FOP_grandes_trabajos_de_progreso:0 "산업 계획도 조직"
FOP_grandes_trabajos_de_progreso_desc:0 "The old regime left Patagonia in a state of abject destitution, lacking any semblance of modern industry. Patagonia's own industrial revolution will have the ultimate goal of bringing prosperity to our people, but before we can fulfill it we'll need to establish the supply chains needed to fuel it from abroad."

FOP_where_we_gonna_build:0 "Central Construction Agency"
FOP_where_we_gonna_build_desc:0 "Abandoning the exploitation and whims of the free market, we'll set up a central planning committee in Puerto Madryn to oversee future developments in the region. By setting clear goals for ourselves and our workers, we'll be able to create the basic industry and infrastructure that Patagonia needs more efficiently."

FOP_fund_north_patagonia:0 "Divert Funds to Chubut"
FOP_fund_north_patagonia_desc:0 "The Northern Region of Patagonia, Chubut, has become the heart of the revolution, but it is far from being the muscle capable of carrying out our revolution. By diverting funds to the region, the Central Construction Agency hopes to be able to set up development areas for future industry."

FOP_fund_south_patagonia:0 "Divert Funds to Santa Cruz"
FOP_fund_south_patagonia_desc:0 "The Southern Region of Patagonia, Santa Cruz, has been largely a backwater region of Argentina, with barely a few fishing towns and a few mines worth noting. By diverting funds to it, the Central Construction Agency hopes to make the region catch up with Chubut in terms of development so that it may hopefully become less of a weight, and more of a supporting province for our efforts."

FOP_factory1:0 "Patagonia's Industrial Revolution"
FOP_factory1_desc:0 "Through the great efforts of our laborers the goal of turning Patagonia into a fully modern industrialized state is finally within reach. It won't be long now until we've gone from being one of Argentina's poorest regions to having our very own industrial revolution!"

FOP_military1:0 "Military Autarky"
FOP_military1_desc:0 "Gone are the days of relying solely on the kindness of our comrades. Through our toil and dedication, we're close to achieving self-sufficiency. With a steady stream of guns being produced by Patagonian hands for our war effort, we'll be better prepared to defend ourselves than ever before."

FOP_further_boat_conversions:0 "Expand the Fishing Fleet"
FOP_further_boat_conversions_desc:0 "Our fleet is currently able to meet the bare basics of our people's needs. It's a start, but if we devoted more of our resources towards expanding our fleet we'll be able to truly enjoy the riches that the oceans can offer us."

FOP_chilean_naval_assistance:0 "Chilean Naval Assistance"
FOP_chilean_naval_assistance_desc:0 "Our comrades in Santiago have aided us with soldiers, guns and resources since the dawn of our revolution. In exchange for some future concessions down the line, they'll be willing to send some of their naval engineers our way to expand one of our minor ports to house a shipbuilding facility as well."

FOP_request_syndie_countries_ship_designs:0 "Request International Navy Assistance"
FOP_request_syndie_countries_ship_designs_desc:0 "In the spirit of international cooperation, we will request our comrades abroad to assist us in our efforts to establish a coast guard. Even if they can only spare a few relics from the Weltkrieg, it would go a long way to safeguard our coastline from the counter-revolutionary forces."

FOP_request_syndie_subs:0 "Request International Subs"
FOP_request_syndie_subs_desc:0 "With a coast guard in place to protect our coast, we now need to look for a means of striking at the jugular of the reactionaries. If our socialist comrades prove willing to provide us with a handful of their older submarine models, we should be able to wage a revolutionary guerrilla war beneath the seas if they dare to attack us!"

FOP_syndie_support:0 "International Officer Training"
FOP_syndie_support_desc:0 "Most of our navy is currently commanded a mix of the captains of converted civilian vessels and inexperienced civilians voted into a commanding position. If we could convince the Third International to help us train our officers, it could prove invaluable in our efforts to strengthen our navy."

FOP_coastal_defences:0 "Coastal Defenses"
FOP_coastal_defences_desc:0 "Should our coast guard be forced back into port or sunk, our cities will be completely exposed to naval landings by the reactionaries. To prevent them from employing such cowardly tactics against us, we must build defensive fortifications along our coast."

FOP_the_population_issue:0 "Population Surveys"
FOP_the_population_issue_desc:0 "In order to properly prepare for the incoming war, we need to carry out a census of our population, and begin drafting conscription lists, as we will need to dig our claws deep for every reserve soldier we can send to the front"

FOP_rally_the_people:0 "노동자들을 소집하라!"
FOP_rally_the_people_desc:0 "The Frente Obrero's Cause is just! The workers of the north would be wise to see this, and while their voices are kept quiet by the northern regime, we can still reach them via our informants and hidden transmissions. We will help them reach our lines so that they can help us overthrow the regime that dared oppress them."

FOP_increase_conscription:0 "Women at Arms"
FOP_increase_conscription_desc:0 "Our adversaries to the north have held down the women of Argentina for far too long. Therefore, we'll give a rifle to every woman that's willing to serve in our army in the spirit of equality and actively encourage more to do so. While some petty traditionalists may disagree with this measure it'll help greatly to even out the odds against Buenos Aires."

FOP_mass_army:0 "Mass Recruitment Scheme"
FOP_mass_army_desc:0 "In order to make up the difference in manpower we need to bring as many people as possible into our ranks. We'll set up recruitment offices across our revolutionary state and send out officers throughout the countryside to encourage people to volunteer for our cause. While the hasted efforts may degrade our army's quality slightly, it'll effectively solve our manpower crisis."

FOP_mass_training_methods:0 "Improvised Weaponry"
FOP_mass_training_methods_desc:0 "Just like we had to cut some corners to make up the difference in manpower between us and Buenos Aires, we need to do the same for our equipment. We'll set up a series of workshops in the countryside and use Patagonian ingenuity to turn common civilian utilities into deadly weapons of wars. A makeshift weapon is better than an empty hand!"

FOP_more_is_needed:0 "Encourage the Unwilling"
FOP_more_is_needed_desc:0 "Our enemies gravely outnumber us and to make up for this weakness we'll need to encourage the unwilling to do what's right and take up arms against the enemy. While this move will disrupt Patagonian society, it's better than to end up as slaves under [ARG.GetLeaderName]."

FOP_imports_from_chile:0 "Chilean Military Aid"
FOP_imports_from_chile_desc:0 "As we stand on the precipice of war, our comrades on the other side of the Andes have informed us that they're ready to step up their military aid to us. This will go a long way towards equipping our fledgling revolutionary army with proper guns."

FOP_internationale_guns:0 "Internationale Guns"
FOP_internationale_guns_desc:0 "Our comrades in Chile can only provide us with so much. In order to make sure every soldier has a rifle and enough ammunition to make up for the superior numbers of the counter-revolutionaries, we'll need to look abroad for help. Thankfully, our comrades in Paris and London will be able to provide us with what we need in the spirit of red solidarity."

FOP_indiscriminate_conscription:0 "Indiscriminate Conscription"
FOP_indiscriminate_conscription_desc:0 "In order to solve our manpower shortages we may be forced to expand the size and scope of our conscription efforts. Every man and woman need to do their duty for the revolution. Even if the quality of our army will suffer until we win the war due to the influx of unfit soldiers into the ranks, an unfit soldier is better than no soldier at all."

FOP_call_on_chilean_manpower:0 "Call for Chilean Volunteers"
FOP_call_on_chilean_manpower_desc:0 "Many of our comrades across the Andes are eager to spread the revolution and fight for their country, but are unable to enlist and fight in the Chilean army. We need to get the message to as many of them as possible that there's a ration, rifle and an opportunity to spread the revolution on our side of the border."

FOP_call_on_european_help:0 "Call for European Manpower"
FOP_call_on_european_help_desc:0 "Even if we gave a rifle to every man and woman in Patagonia we'd still be outnumbered. To match our enemies, we must call on our comrades in Europe to help bolster our ranks. Luckily for us, the cradle of the world revolution is full to the brim with revolutionaries that are eager to help the socialist cause. All we need to do is to put out the word and help them reach our shores."

FOP_international_army:0 "International Force"
FOP_international_army_desc:0 "There are untold thousands of aspiring and veteran revolutionaries across the world that are ready, willing and able to enlist with us. We only need to spread the message and aid as many of them as possible to join us. While this will lead to some coordination issues between our soldiers, it'll make sure our ranks are full."

FOP_international_officers:0 "International Air Volunteers"
FOP_international_officers_desc:0 "While the idea of a Patagonian air force is presently unrealistic, our increased contacts with foreign revolutionaries has allowed us to reach out to experienced pilots around the world ready to turn the skies red. While these daredevils can only provide their own planes, having them on our side will deny the capitalists the uncontested skies they're expecting!"

FOP_manpower_issue_solved:0 "Population Issue Solved"
FOP_manpower_issue_solved_desc:0 "Desperate times have indeed called for desperate measures but thanks to our efforts we now boast a force that can stand up to the oppressors in the north. When the foe comes to try and take our freedom away we're finally ready to fight them with a full manned revolutionary army!"

FOP_man_the_border:0 "Fortify the Border"
FOP_man_the_border_desc:0 "With the enemy's superiority in numbers and equipment a defensive stance is not out of the question. By dotting our front line with fortifications and trenches we'll make sure that our former oppressors will pay a heavy price for every inch of Patagonian soil they try to steal from our liberated workers!"

FOP_new_infantry_equ:0 "Infiltrating the North"
FOP_new_infantry_equ_desc:0 "Fighting the enemy on their terms will be the death of us. Instead, we'll destroy our foe by fighting unconventionally and forcing them to meet us on our terms, not theirs."

FOP_organise_the_troops:0 "European Way of War"
FOP_organise_the_troops_desc:0 "Most of our fighters are militiamen and guerrillas without any formal military backgrounds. While more than capable of defending our country, some of our European comrades are offering to help us organize our divisions according to a more regular model. Integrating more of these veterans to train our militias will also help us improve their overall efficiency as well."

FOP_mountain_professionals:0 "Strike the Railroads"
FOP_mountain_professionals_desc:0 "Argentina is a vast land of mountains and rivers. This forces the enemy to rely heavily on railroads to move their forces through the country. If we could prepare a series of railroad sabotages, we should be able to temporarily cripple their mobility in the first crucial weeks of the war."

FOP_infiltration_time:0 "Infiltrator Cells"
FOP_infiltration_time_desc:0 "Argentina is a vast land of mountains and rivers. This forces the enemy to rely heavily on railroads to move their forces through the country. If we could prepare a series of railroad sabotages, we should be able to temporarily cripple their mobility in the first crucial weeks of the war."

FOP_armored_mechanized_research:0 "International Armor Specialists"
FOP_armored_mechanized_research_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg proved the effectiveness of tanks in modern breakthrough operations. For our revolutionary armed forces to fully transition into a modern army, it's necessary for us to develop a mechanized branch. By soliciting help from British and French engineers, we should be able to speed up this process significantly."

FOP_military_research:0 "Standardizing Our Tactics"
FOP_military_research_desc:0 "The very decentralized nature of our forces has led to a situation where each squad has its own tactics and methods, and sometimes they aren't even that organized. While unpredictability has its advantages, we should at least standardize our army tactics to the point where our officers can at least predict what moves their comrades can be expected to make."

FOP_army_drills:0 "Veteran Instructors"
FOP_army_drills_desc:0 "Since our revolutionary army mostly consists of volunteer militias drawn from local population, their quality is severely inconsistent from regiment to regiment. By carefully picking out and embedding some of our more more capable and experienced experienced veterans with our fresh  recruits we'll be able to even out their performance and better preserve the army's institutional knowledge."

FOP_new_training_methods:0 "Unconventional Supply Networks"
FOP_new_training_methods_desc:0 "The way we fight means that our revolutionary soldiers often find themselves outside of anything resembling a conventional supply chain. By setting up forward supply caches ahead of advances and training our fighters to better forage for supplies behind enemy lines, we'll vastly improve our overall supply situation."

FOP_military_research2:0 "Foreign Doctrine Assistance"
FOP_military_research2_desc:0 "As our army gains experience, our tactics are also improving. However, now that we're starting to move away from the basics, we need to start defining what shape our grand strategy should take, and we should look to the Internationale for help in this matter."

FOP_organised_force:0 "Mandatory Militia Training"
FOP_organised_force_desc:0 "The constant threat from counter-revolutionaries in Buenos Aires and beyond is forcing us to mandate that our citizens undergo a basic militia training regimen. By preparing our people both physically and mentally for future conflicts, they can be turned into combat-worthy soldiers far more efficiently once their service to the revolution is needed the most."

FOP_national_defence:0 "A Militarized Society"
FOP_national_defence_desc:0 "There can be no permanent peace with the counter-revolutionaries and to safeguard our revolution we'll need to militarize our society for the inevitably conflicts that lie ahead. With a citizenry that's prepared and ready for war, anyone foolish enough to wage war against our lands will be met with fierce resistance from every layer of society."

### Political Tree ###
FOP_The_revolution_succesful:0 "혁명의 성공"
FOP_The_revolution_succesful_desc:0 "그 모든 역경에도 불구하고, 우리는 위풍당당하게 서 있습니다. 조국은 폐허가 되었으며, 우리 인민들은 당분간 이런 상황에 적응해야 할지도 모릅니다. 그러나 이 나라를 일으켜 세운 것은 우리 노동자들이라는 것을 잊어선 안 됩니다. 그리고 우리는 다시 한 번 일으켜 세울 준비가 되었습니다!"
FOP_first_national_TUC:0 "The First National Trade Union Congress"
FOP_first_national_TUC_desc:0 "Coming from a tradition of Republican democracy, Argentina had never had a Trade Union Congress up to this point, and while many are anxious to see this historical events, many are wary of it being simply a masquerade for a dictatorial regime. As the gates to the old Congress open to the Union delegates, the fate of the nation hangs in the balance..."
FOP_the_anarchist_radicals:0 "The Anarchist Radicals"
FOP_the_anarchist_radicals_desc:0 "With Severino di Giovanni now serving as the acting chairman, the Anarchist Radicals of the USA have come out on top of the other factions decisively. With a very harsh stance on religion, inequality and nationalism, the Anarchists will attempt to sweep whatever remained from the old Argentina away, and make the Argentinean territory a nation for all workers of the world."
FOP_Equal_Roles_for_Men_and_Women:0 "여성의 권리 논쟁"
FOP_Equal_Roles_for_Men_and_Women_desc:0 "With the conservative regimes trying to keep women as separate from men for a long time, the coming of more liberal regimes over the years changed the outlook for many of them, leading to the creation of many feminist organizations and the inclusion of women in many areas like cinema with equal status. However, Giovanni wish to take this a step further, and such matter will need to be discussed in the congress..."
FOP_Seize_Church_Property:0 "교회와의 전쟁"
FOP_Seize_Church_Property_desc:0 "아르헨티나는 교회가 정치계의 주요 권력 브로커 역할을 하는 등, 사실상 세속 국가였던 적이 한 번도 없습니다. 그러나 혁명 정권이 들어선 지금, 이런 사태는 반드시 종식될 것입니다. 세베리노의 부하들이 아르헨티나의 모든 성직자들을 기소할 준비를 하고 있으며, 그들이 원하는 것은 교회를 국가에서 완전히 제거하는 것뿐입니다..."
FOP_Build_a_New_Society:0 "새로운 사회 건설"
FOP_Build_a_New_Society_desc:0 "Now that the Congress' tasks have been completed, Severino has offered to pass a bill severely weakening the Congress, in exchange transferring most of its duties to a Federal council elected by regional councils. While that may reduce our control over the farthest regions of our nation, it will allow the more industrialized sectors to run more smoothly."
FOP_the_anarchist_moderates:0 "The Anarchist Moderates"
FOP_the_anarchist_moderates_desc:0 "With Soto remaining in his post of chairman, the USA remains on top of the other Trade Unions, and is now preparing to carry out sweeping changes to the nation. While ideologically driven, Soto is by far a pragmatist within the revolutionary movement, and he'll seek to compromise the anarchist ideals with the society he now has the duty to rebuild. Only time will tell whether this will be succesful..."
FOP_moderate_decentralization:0 "Moderate Decentralization"
FOP_moderate_decentralization_desc:0 "While a compromising man, Soto is still an anarchist, and has therefore ordered for some of the responsabilities of the Congress to be delegated to local and regional councils, only keeping largely essential tasks for the central government. While the balance of power hasn't shifted as dramatically as originally envisioned, it still marks a change from the centralized nature of the Argentinean system."
FOP_War_Anarchism:0 "War Preparations Bill"
FOP_War_Anarchism_desc:0 "While it would be the wish of many anarchists to completely abolish the Congress, the truth is that there are many reactionary regimes glancing at our nation, waiting for a time of weakness to strike. As such, Chairman Giovanni has proposed a War Preparations Bill for the congress, extending his rule and the existance of the Congress indefinitely until 'The times of reactionary aggression are at an end'."
FOP_Root_out_Reactionaries:0 "Root out Reactionaries"
FOP_Root_out_Reactionaries_desc:0 "Our nation cannot be safe from foreign reactionaries if local reactionaries aid them in snuffing out our revolution. We can give these traitors no quarter, and as such, we shall stage a national effort to capture any and all who may threaten our revolution."

FOP_Uruguay_line:0 "The Wisdom of our Veterans"
FOP_Uruguay_line_desc:0 "Perhaps our most valuable resource is the vast number of war veterans throughout our society. Though a lot of them starting to become unfit for the harshness of the front lines, their wealth of knowledge must not go to waste. By assigning more of them to train the next generation of soldiers, we'll increase our training efficiency."

FOP_Uruguay_line:0 "The Wisdom of our Veterans"
FOP_Uruguay_line_desc:0 "Perhaps our most valuable resource is the vast number of war veterans throughout our society. Though a lot of them starting to become unfit for the harshness of the front lines, their wealth of knowledge must not go to waste. By assigning more of them to train the next generation of soldiers, we'll increase our training efficiency."


FOP_revolutionary_outpost:0 "Defensive Measures"
FOP_revolutionary_outpost_desc:0 "The revolutionary war taught us to rapidly prepare defenses even with the slimmest resources and material at our disposal. If taught more broadly, these lessons could allow us to improve our fortification construction speed without cutting back on their effectiveness."

FOP_the_workers_militia:0 "Federal Militia Recruitment Drive"
FOP_the_workers_militia_desc:0 "While every region is free to have their own militia, we still require a federal army to fight against the reactionaries. The proposed solution to this by the regional councils is to 'draft' a percentage of their regional militias that will instead fight for us for a period of time agreed on with each council. While it may not provide for the best trained forces, it will certainly give us ideologically driven soldiers."
FOP_Reconciliate_with_the_church:0 "Reconciliate with the Church"
FOP_Reconciliate_with_the_church_desc:0 "With the Argentinean Catholic church having stood as a major power broker for decades, if not centuries dating back to the colonial era, it may be wise to reapproach them in order to secure our regime..."
FOP_pass_revolutionary_laws:0 "Pass Revolutionary Laws"
FOP_pass_revolutionary_laws_desc:0 "With the coming of a revolutionary government, it is time for the congress to give the workers what they want. With the passing of worker friendly laws, like paid vacations, the creation of democratized workplaces, authorizing handouts for the unemployed and disabled, we are sure to gain the support of the industrial workers of the nation!"
FOP_Cooperate_with_the_UC:0 "Cooperate with the UC"
FOP_Cooperate_with_the_UC_desc:0 "The Union Civica, the coalition representing the Union Civica Radical and the Union Civica Radical Antipersonalista, have openly supported us, with many of their members joining the FORA to give our trade union extra weight in the Congress. As well, we had already been supportive of each other's policies over the years, and it is only right that now that we stand on top we give them a place in our government"
FOP_the_moderates:0 "The Socialist Party Moderates"
FOP_the_moderates_desc:0 "After decades of struggle, the Socialist party has finally managed to become the dominant force in Argentinean politics. Unsurprisingly, it has been fairly well received by the public, as the Socialist party already had a history of sensible compromises and welfare bills, and it is expected that their rule, while not as radical as the other unions, will still try to reform our nation in favour of the workers."
FOP_reinstate_municipal_elections:0 "Reinstate Municipal Elections"
FOP_reinstate_municipal_elections_desc:0 "The Socialists were never in favour of reforming Argentina around the Trade Unions, and as such, have proposed a bill in the Congress to allow for the Municipalities to elect their officials once more unrestricted. While receiving harsh protests from the opposition, the majority of the socialist party ensures that the bill will not have any severe complications."
FOP_Hold_Provincial_Elections:0 "Hold Provincial Elections"
FOP_Hold_Provincial_Elections_desc:0 "As part of their efforts to restore the Argentinean Republic back, the Socialists have proposed a bill that will allow the individual provinces that make up Argentina to vote for their governors once more. While they have had interim governors since the end of the civil war, it is now time for the people to give the role to someone of their choosing."
FOP_restore_the_suspended_constitution:0 "Restore the Suspended Constitution"
FOP_restore_the_suspended_constitution_desc:0 "The final step to fully bring back the Argentinean Republic is to restore the constitution of 1898. While some revolutionaries may loathe its existance, our founder Juan B. Justo was a staunch defender of constitutionalism, and while the option to reform it to adapt it to our rule will remain on the table, we must first fully reintroduce it."
FOP_expand_the_Hogar_Obrero:0 "Expand the Hogar Obrero"
FOP_expand_the_Hogar_Obrero_desc:0 "The Hogar Obrero, a construction cooperative created by the founders of the PS back in 1905, has long since been the preferred housing company for the Socialists. With our government in power, we should expand their operations, and include them in public works programmes so that we can end homelessness in Argentina once and for all."
FOP_Steer_the_Market:0 "Establish a Free Market"
FOP_Steer_the_Market_desc:0 "The founder of the Partido Socialista, Juan B. Justo, was a loyal follower of the ideas of free trade and the wealth it brought. However, he was also mindful of how workers could be exploited out of their earnings. As their succesors, we shall seek to establish a competitive internal free market, ensuring that only cooperatives or other forms of worker-favourable organizations can truly compete in it."
FOP_maintain_revolutionary_democracy:0 "Maintain Revolutionary Democracy"
FOP_maintain_revolutionary_democracy_desc:0 "Despite the please to return to the old constitution, the truth is that the revolution has changed Argentina forever. It'd be a mistake to return to the old system, and instead we should seek to consolidate the Socialists' power on the Trade Union Congress, as opposed to bringing back the old congress, regardless of how much that may insult other parties..."
FOP_the_Baldomeristas:0 "The Baldomeristas"
FOP_the_Baldomeristas_desc:0 "The Baldomeristas, rising from a small club to a sizable faction of the Socialists with the victory of the revolution, they seek a new approach to Socialism, one that merges the ideas of Argentinean nationalism, American Anti Imperialism and other concepts like Agrarianism and Economic Democracy. Only time will tell whether this mix will work out for or against the new Chairman."
FOP_Economic_Democracy:0 "Introduction of Worker Self-Management"
FOP_Economic_Democracy_desc:0 "With the Chairman secure in power, he has decided to pass a bill on the Congress, asking to nationalize a series of key companies in Argentina. However, he has stated he does not wish to add them to the state machinery, but instead allow the workers to manage the company from now on."
FOP_Encourage_Workers_Cooperatives:0 "Encourage Worker Cooperatives"
FOP_Encourage_Workers_Cooperatives_desc:0 "In order to promote a smoother transition to a socialist economy, the chairman has proposed to hand out loans to entrepreneurial enterprises so long as they are managed by the workers. While the loans may not come cheap initially the rewards we will reap in the long term may be worth our investment."
FOP_Collaborate_with_the_CGT:0 "Collaborate with the CGT"
FOP_Collaborate_with_the_CGT_desc:0 "The Central General del Trabajo, nearly destroyed by the other unions for having collaborated with the older Argentinean regimes, is fully loyal to Baldomero's cause. As such, we should seek to reward their loyalty by giving attention to their requests, and granting some of their members access to our funds for some of their projects..."
FOP_Socialist_Patriotism:0 "Encourage Patriotism"
FOP_Socialist_Patriotism_desc:0 "While a Socialist nation, Baldomero sustains that our fight against imperialism and capitalism didn't start in 1921, but in 1810 when our forefathers seceded from Spain. As such, the very image of Argentina stands as a testament to anti Imperialism. In order to further cement this idea to the public, he has launched an education and propaganda campaign so that every Argentinean can be a patriot without shame!"
FOP_pan_american_alliance:0 "United South American States"
FOP_pan_american_alliance_desc:0 "While we respect the Internationale's intentions towards world revolution, it is hard to trust our defense to nations that are so far away and that have had their cultures and histories tainted with so many acts of savage imperialism against our continent and many others. As such, we will look towards ourselves for protection, and start a new faction that will look after the South American nations."
FOP_Breadbasket_of_the_Revolution:0 "Breadbasket of the Revolution"
FOP_Breadbasket_of_the_Revolution_desc:0 "Argentina has been known for a long time now as the 'Granary of the world'. With the syndicalists in Europe in a warpath against the reactionaries, we need to utilize this strength of our nation to our allies advantage, and provide them with some much needed supplies."
FOP_the_jacobin_supremacy:0 "The Communist Supremacy"
FOP_the_jacobin_supremacy_desc:0 "Despite having suffered a major setback when the October Revolution failed in Russia, the Argentinean Communist party has managed to reach power regardless, and now holds the majority of the seats in the Congress. While their shared dream with the Bolsheviks of a new world order under a Communist banner may still be far away, this victory has certainly brought them one step closer."
FOP_Economic_Aid_for_the_Third_Internationale:0 "Aid for the Internationale"
FOP_Economic_Aid_for_the_Third_Internationale_desc:0 "As Argentina recovers from the blows suffered in the last two decades, first with the British collapse and then with Black Monday, on top of the civil war between the FOP and Argentina, our allies in Europe find themselves with their budgets tight as war approaches their borders. It is our duty to the world revolution to aid them, and so, as our industry roars once more, we should focus on giving them our aid."
FOP_Join_the_Third_Internationale:0 "Join the Third Internationale"
FOP_Join_the_Third_Internationale_desc:0 "With our cities and industry rebuilt and the workers safe from Capitalist predation, we can once more turn our gaze towards the international revolutionary struggle. The hammer of Marx and the sickle of Lenin shall rise over the world as we bring the might of the Proleteriat down upon the Capitalists."
FOP_Footsoldiers_of_the_Revolution:0 "Permanent Conscription Brigades"
FOP_Footsoldiers_of_the_Revolution_desc:0 "Conscription Brigades were adopted by Communist militias while we waited to attack the reactionaries. While some level of success was achieved, the revolutionary plans of the Communists require a larger military force, and so they have chosen to implement conscription brigades permanently, so our forces will have enough manpower to continue helping the World Revolution."

While times have certainly changed, the strategic position of the Kingdom at the very edge of the world is once again an advantadge, as the constant trumoil across the North Atlantic increases shipping traffic in the far south, putting our realm and its ports in a uniquely strategic position we'd be foolish not to take advantadge of."

As such, his lifelong struggle for Patagonia often passed as a quest for personal ambition rather than duty and selflessness. Even when he was mocked and derided by foreign courts and press, when he had to almost ruin himslef travelling abroad to gather support, or how he even now moved to a land he never saw, to fufill the oaths of his predessors. As we establish more and more schools in both Spanish and native languages, we cannot neglect the need to remind the people of the great live and cause of Antonie, King of Patagonia "

### Events ###
fopintro.1.t:0 "The Revolutionary Fires"
fopintro.1.d:0 "Argentina was in a state of chaos during the Weltkrieg, with British companies exploiting its people and resources to get everything they could for the war. This lead to unrest throughout the nation, but especially in the south of the country, in Patagonia. Extremely poor working conditions brought the rise of Socialism and Syndicalism, with thousands of people refusing to work and rioting through the streets. The British forced the Argentine government to intervene, turning riots into rebellion during the events that led to the Semana Tragica. The situation only escalated further and further from there, with the LP growing in strength in the main cities, particularly with the Buenos Aires City Oligarchy. However, deep in the south of Argentina, a new type of unrest grew. What started as a simple strike of rural workers became a general strike in the south, demanding for the payment of wages that had been due for months and the improvement of working conditions. While an agreement was reached at first with the creation of the 'First Rural Agreement of the Patagonia', when the land owners didn't keep their promises, the workers started another general strike, forcing an armed retaliation by an expedition lead by Lieutenant Colonel Hector Benigno Varela. The workers, trusting Varela after he had helped create the first agreement, would try to negotiate with the officer, only to be met with a dreadful realization: Varela was there to demand nothing more than unconditional surrender of the strikers, and he was willing to shoot all who opposed to keep control of the Patagonia."
fopintro.1.a:0 "A Sad Start for Our Revolution"

fopintro.2.t:0 "The Patagonia Rebelde"
fopintro.2.d:0 "The workers, rallied behind the figure of Antonio Soto and Jose 'Facon Grande' Font, decided that the time for revolution was now. Despite the disarmament clause in the original Rural Agreement, most of Soto's anarchist had left their weapons to Alfredo 'El Toscano' Fonte, after he and many other more radical 'anarchists' refused the agreement, and so Soto found himself having to ally with the Patagonian bandit in order to get the equipment to arm the workers to fight. After the initial victories of the Army, the workers dealt a decisive victory at La Anita farm, and with the coordination of the FORA through telegraph lines and message runners, the Second Great Patagonic Strike only grew and grew in strength, with the Argentinian army being unable to deal with it without sparking heavy political backlash in the capital for the popular UCR in power."
fopintro.2.a:0 "United Workers Will Never Be Beaten!"

fopintro.3.t:0 "The Contemporary Frente Obrero Patagonico"
fopintro.3.d:0 "Many years later, the fire of the revolution continues to burn in Patagonia. Chile had to step in and protect the FOP from the north, and so hold much sway in how the nation is ran. Antonio Soto, leader of FORA and one of the main participants in the revolution, has lead the nation ever since, leading a loose and fragile coalition of Anarchists, Communists and Radical Socialists. Due to political instability, proper elections have not been held yet, however Soto has promised to step down of his position once the crisis with Argentina ends, whatever the result may be. There are worries that the election won't take place in time, for due to the rise of Carlés in the north, people fear that invasion will happen soon. However, with the Patagonic Strike being seen as the beacon of anarchism and socialism by many, international support both by the Internationale and by willing anarchists and exiled Bolsheviks alike is not on short supply, and so the workers that may appear to be stranded in such an apparent desolate wasteland like Patagonia may still stand a chance..."
fopintro.3.a:0 "Viva la Revolución!"

fop.2.t:0 "The FOP Calls for Chilean Volunteers"
fop.2.d:0 "We have just received word from our neighbours in Patagonia that they are requesting we send them volunteers for their upcoming war against the core Argentinian government. We have promised that we will aid them in their future war, and they are our chance to defeat the Argentine menace. However, we also need to cover our own fronts in the Paso de los Libertadores and in the Atacama Region, how should we react?"

fop.2.b:0 "What benefit do we gain? Refuse them."

fop.5.t:0 "The FOP Requests Manpower"
fop.5.d:0 "The Workers Front of Patagonia, known as the FOP, has requested that we aid their struggle by sending them manpower and equipment. Soon they will face war with the Argentine government, and they need to be prepared for when it happens. If they succeed, they can become a permanent foothold of Syndicalism in South America."
fop.5.a:0 "We will send men and guns."
fop.5.b:0 "We will only send men."
fop.5.c:0 "South America is too far away..."

fop.6.t:0 "The Hannaford Idea"
fop.6.d:0 "Guillermo Mac Hannaford, an ex-army major of the Argentinian military, has been condemned for a lifetime of prison for seemingly betraying the reactionary Argentinian Military and leaking official documents to Paraguay and Chile. Luckily for us, insiders in the Argentinian military have indicated that he'll be transported to the Prisión Regional del Sur, a high security prison in the territory of Neuquén, which conveniently sits less than a few hundred kilometres from our border.\n\nUnexpectedly, many of the different factions of our military have jumped at the chance of presenting plans to recover this would-be revolutionary from the reactionary grasp. While some of them are insanely optimistic, the ones that have stood out the most have been a proposal by Buenaventura Durruti's 'Avengers', which suggests utilizing a militia attack as a distraction in the Viedma Area to act as a diversion of a full-scale breakthrough into the prison. In stark opposition of this plan, comrade Iosif Dzugashvili, in his experience, has suggested us to pick a smaller team to infiltrate the area, with a couple columns on standby to assist in case the situation escalates, and instead rescue the officer. The last proposal to be seriously considered, thrown in by Marc Augier, is to simply send a column in the prison's general direction, and let the officers in charge deal with whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nEach plan carries its own risk for us, unfortunately. While Durruti and Dzugashvili's experience as bank robbers and terrorists in Spain and Russia give them some pedigree in this kind of covert operations, there's no denying we can't exactly commit all the resources they ask of us. By contrast, while the Augier plan is less reliable on paper as the column may just collapse and scatter, it's certainly helping us commit less assets to what's essentially a non-prioritary target. What should the Revolutionary Comittee favour?"
fop.6.a:0 "Give Durruti what he asks"
fop.6.b:0 "Comrade Dzhugashvili will Have our Resources"
fop.6.c:0 "Go through with Augier's Plan"
fop.6.e:0 "This is a Waste of Time"

fop.7.t:0 "Hannaford made it out Alive"
fop.7.d:0 "Our mission was a great success, with us successfully getting Hannaford out of prison alive, as well as most of our troops. Our troops ran circles around the Argentinian garrison and it is not only a military success, but a moral victory as well. If we keep this up, there may actually be a chance for our revolution to succeed!"
fop.7.a:0 "Excellent."

fop.8.t:0 "Hannaford Died but our Troops Escaped"
fop.8.d:0 "While sieging the prison Hannaford was trapped in, he was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. However, most of our troops escaped unharmed, and so while the mission failed, morale still remains high among our troops."
fop.8.a:0 "That's not terrible."

fop.9.t:0 "Major Mission Failure"
fop.9.d:0 "The mission failed massively, while they were able to escape the prison with Hannaford they were misdirected on their return. This allowed a nearby garrison to pincer our troops between them and the prison garrison with Hannaford dying and most of our troops being lost in the escape. This defeat will surely impact the morale of our troops, and it puts a dent on our leadership's reputation."
fop.9.a:0 "Damn."

fop.10.t:0 "Hannaford is Refusing to Help"
fop.10.d:0 "We successfully got Hannaford out of prison alive, but there is still a problem. He is currently refusing to aid our revolution. Hannaford himself, at least according to the intelligence we could gather on his imprisonment, was accused of spying for Paraguay but such accusation had little evidence to support the case, leading some of our command to speculate that he was being framed by a rival in the Army. With that in mind, we believe we can take advantage of the administrative chaos in the North for our agents to dig up information that may help him see things our way. Perhaps, if we show him the truth of the matter, he'll join our side..."
fop.10.a:0 "Send the word to Buenos Aires, Our Agents should be able to Find something Worthwhile"
fop.10.b:0 "Just Interrogate Him and Extract whatever Useful Information we can from Him"

fop.11.t:0 "Hannaford has Accepted to Work with Us"
fop.11.d:0 "Our Agents were able to get information on Hannaford's case via army informants, and have managed to uncover a seeming conspiracy to remove Hannaford from command in the Army, with the tacit approval of many members of the GOU. By all means, this move seems to be an undercover form of a purge, and it's hard to assess if many other officers have suffered unfair demotions or imprisonment in the same way Hannaford has. With that information, we have compiled a file and given it to Hannaford, who, while taking his time to take it all in with some level of disbelief, has finally accepted to work with our government. In return he has requested that our agents in Buenos Aires arrange for the transfer of his family to our territory."
fop.11.a:0 "A Worthy Price for a Worthy Officer"

fop.12.t:0 "Hannaford has Refused to Cooperate"
fop.12.d:0 "Despite our attempts at uncovering information about the Hannaford case, we have unfortunately been unsuccessful and he has proven unusually hard to persuade. Without much choice, we have instead chosen to imprison Hannaford and proceed to extract whatever useful information he has for us."
fop.12.a:0 "We'll Make do Whether You're With us or Against us..."

Unsurprisingly, One of the battalions is led by an officer affiliated to the communist party, and the other by a well known anarchists. While an investigation by both sides is being carried out to figure out which is the guilty party for such a mishap, it's clear that both sides are pointing fingers at each other, and an attempt at an objective investigation is becoming harder by the day.

Farmstead break-ins and robberies are no novelty in the Argentinian country-side, and even some of the original members of the Patagonic strikes, like Alfredo Fonte, were known homestead robbers. However, while the practice may not be uncommon, it damages our reputation reputation with the civilian populace, which may start to see us as nothing more than an outgrown gang of thieves.

While the communists have been using these methods since before the war even began, this has caused friction with the other factions.

Patagonia has been historically a largely undeveloped steppe with occasional rural villages and fishing towns. The 'Three Economic Issues', as dubbed by the ruling Cabinet are:\n\n-A lack of naval infrastructure to both trade and oppose the Argentinian navy in any significant capacity.\n-A lack of basic resources and resource infrastructure. This means that, even if there are some limited reserves of iron and coal in our territory, we both lack the infrastructure to refine it into steel, as well as having an underwhelming infrastructure for its transport.\n-A lack of industry. This one has become the most apparent, as we now rely on Chile for practically everything except for the most immediate supplies like food and water. We will need to solve this, not just so that we can further bolster our combined strength but also so that we can stand up for ourselves in the case that Chile has to pull out their support to defend themselves.\n\n If we are to survive against the reactionary government in the north, we will need to undergo drastic change to get the men and materiel needed for the revolution to even survive.

Given our shortage of manpower, the Revolutionary Government has found no better choice than to utilize these mines and camps as provisional punishment for petty crimes against the people or the government.

The moderate faction, led by the current chairman and now revolutionary hero Antonio Soto, and the now statesman and figurehead of the movement Emilio Lopez Arango, they plan on simply passing anarchist reforms to try and slowly 'accustom' Argentina into the anarchist ideals, trying to compromise with the existing forces in the country rather than forcing them to comply.

Despite largely being the underdogs for the Congress, their newly found strength has allowed them to be able to have a significant chance at winning the Congress, and as such, the CUSC has opted to not try and split the votes and has unanimously appointed Rodolfo Ghioldi as their leading delegate in the Congress.

The first delegation to take the stage was the one of the FORA, advocating that only the leaders of the Liga Patriotica (LP) should be put on trial, arguing the concepts of Obediencia Debida (Due Obedience), which would absolve most military commanders and civil servants from any connections to the regime unless they were direct members of the LP. This proposal, while being incredibly unpopular with the other Congress factions, it's very popular outside of the TUC as many former civil servants had no choice but to join the new regime or be left unemployed in the middle of an economic crisis.\nThe Anarchists were the next to propose a solution to the old regime: Each person, no matter their rank and file, would be put on trial individually for their actions, and, if found guilty, would either spend a considerable time in prison or suffer the ultimate penalty for their crimes against the workers. A naturally popular proposal amongst radicals, Socialist delegates have protested the implications of the proposal, as it would mark the revolutionary movement to be as bloodthirsty and oppressive as the Liga Patriotica itself was against the workers.\nFinally, the CUSC, with support from the Internationale, has proposed for the former members of the regime to be taken to forced labour camps. These camps would allow the convicted to work off their sentences, and possibly avoid the death penalty by providing a useful service to the nation. The proposal seems to be striking a good middle ground, while not as merciful as the Socialist one and not as harsh as the anarchist one, it's drawing moderates from both sides towards it trying to draw a compromise, even if the bill has not exactly clarified how long would the sentences be, or how the conditions or locations of the camps would be.

While some entities in Argentina are still marked as territories, proposals to turn those into new provinces had been made, and were interrupted by the Christmas Coup. However, with the success of our revolution, the different trade union delegations disagree on what path to follow going forward.\n\nThe FORA, for their part, propose that no change should be held, and that the territories considered for provinces, like Santa Cruz and Chubut in the South, should be turned into provinces along with the remaining territories. By contrast, the CUSC has said that the system should be changed, in favour of a centralization of power that puts more emphasis on the Federal Government, somewhat resembling the Unitary proposals that had appeared during the Argentinian Warlord Period. Completely opposed to both proposals, the USA has proposed that the system should be abolished instead and a new one based around popular councils should be formed. While this last proposal has caused plenty of controversy, the delegates will have to decide which one shall be more beneficial for the rule of the new Government..."

The CUSC, on their end argue that the Constitution should be redrafted, and while some sections of the original could remain, a new one reflecting the new character of Argentina should be created. The USA, unsurprisingly, has opposed to both proposals, and has decided that they'd prefer the nation to simply nullify the existent constitution and move forward without one, instead encouraging individual communes to adopt a constitution if they so desire.

The Compañía Argentina de Electricidad (C.A.D.E.), formerly known as Compañía Hispano Americana de Electricidad (C.H.A.D.E.), has been a source of trouble for years, with them paying millionaire bribes with both UCR and PDN presidencies in the twenties and early thirties. While we are doing our best to unravel its monopoly, the fact that local branches of the Hogar Obrero have turned to this company for their services has been picked up by the press as proof of our government's involvement in the growth and protection of a de-facto monopoly, with some opposition newspapers outright accusing us of perpetuating the monopoly.

However, while the chairman would like nothing more than to grant these much awaited rights due to personal reasons, there are matters of state at hand that would prevent such a bill to be successful. Argentinian society has been traditionally male-dominated, and very strictly traditionalist in that regard, and such a bill is bound to lose us significant support in the countryside and even amongst revolutionary circles.

In a meeting with the Bishop of Buenos Aires, Soto has agreed to the Church's demands while keeping the Secular nature of our state, allowing the many Catholic schools and rural missions to continue operating in exchange for the tacit approval of the catholics of the new government. While some clergy members have rejected the results of the meeting, a revolutionary commission will be reassigning these rebellious bishops to reeducation camps, where they shall learn how to coexist with the workers. The only concern remaining is the Vatican's stance on the matter, but given the instability in the Italian peninsula, it is largely believed they will not jeopardize the Argentinean clergy by opposing this newly found compromise."

The idea of the ban had been considered for weeks now, with many detractors on the opposition, but the argument that these practices were remnants of the capitalist means to oppress the working class ended up winning out in the Congress in the end.

However, with the limited forces he currently possesses, two options have been brought forward. He could assault one of the revolutionary armories set up near the Parque Centenario, which would cut off the Anarchists from a significant asset to increase their numbers, or he could secure the Fabrica Militar de Polvoras y Explosivos in the north, a few kilometres away from the famous Hippodrome, which would cut off the Anarchists from a major weapons factory."

The alternative is to launch a full on assault on the Casa Rosada's surroundings, and try to open a way for our men to be evacuated.

Scout reports indicate we outnumber them, and by attacking them we may catch them off-guard.

Some officers have stated that a retreat would help us last long enough for reinforcements from the south to arrive in strength, but some have rightfully pointed out that if we retreated further, we will lose the capital and we would be forced to surrender.

fopcoup.99.d1:0 "With the Anarchist Forces finally surrendering and Severino di Giovanni being taken in for trial, a power struggle has erupted within the ranks of the CUSC. With Chairman Ghioldi's inaction almost having caused the complete collapse of the revolutionary government to 'Reactionary Agents' and having caused the death of Comrade Dzhugashvili, Justo has raised a succesful no-confidence vote within their party, who has withdrawn their support from Ghioldi in the Congress. Having lost all allies and finding no exit, Ghioldi has opted to resign from his position, leaving the decision of who will be the new Chairman to the majority faction in the TUC. With the USA being almost completely delegitimized by Di Giovanni's actions, the CUSC has become undoubtedly the majority faction of the TUC, and with the power vested in them, they have elected as chairman the hero of the recent events, General Liborio Justo, to lead the nation for the foreseeable future. After being sworn into office, Justo gave a stirring speech stating that the Argentinian revolution is only the first step towards the liberation of the proletariat in America from the Imperialists."

fopcoup.99.d2:0 "With reinforcements arriving from the south, the Anarchist columns have been able to advance from Zarate towards Rosario, smashing the Communist forces in their way. By the time they were on the outskirts of the city, the Communist forces had offered their surrender to us. Chairman Giovanni has accepted their surrender, but has passed a bill, with ample support in the Trade Union Congress, to ban the CUSC from holding any seats at all. While this has caused some stir amongst the Communist Party members, their forces have already been decimated, and risking prison, exile or even outright execution for betrayal of the revolution, most have complied to the ban and have quit from the Trade Union and later the party. The new influx of members in the FORA and the USA have now greatly bolstered the power that Giovanni and the USA hold over the nation. With the nation fully under his command, it remains to be seen whether Giovanni's vision of a nation without a government will manage to survive in practice."
fopcoup.99.d3:0 "Having presented the information of Giovanni's planned assassination to Soto and Arango to the Congress, the members of the congress, even those holding seemingly radical seats, have pled guilty on the case and Giovanni will now rot away in the Ushuaia Penitentiary. With this move, the power balance in the USA is now solidly on the moderates side, with the radicals having lost their leader and having their close followers de-legitimized. Now, it is up to Chairman Soto and the USA with a majority of the seats in the Congress to deal with bringing back Argentina from the brink of chaos towards a Socialist Utopia."
fopcoup.99.d4:0 "Facing off against both the USA and the CUSC, Baldomero has come out triumphant and smashed both groups' paramilitaries in Buenos Aires. Ordering the rest of their forces to stand down under the authority of the now consolidated Congress, Baldomero has kept his position of chairman despite the odds. With the CGT and the FORA now as the dominant forces of the TUC, Baldomero stands poised to start the Argentinean reconstruction and see the revolutionary ideals of the Frente Obrero realized, or at least, what he envisioned in the Frente Obrero..."

The Trade Union Congress was convened and the members of the USA outright kicked out from the Congress, with the other unions recognizing the new chairman, whether out of loyalty or out of fear. Whether this move will secure the Congress' power or undermine it and focus it on the Chairman, it remains to be seen.

The Trade Union Congress was later convened, and the new Chairman has been officially sworn in, with some coercion necessary towards some of the opposing unions. With this hostile take over, many speculate that the USA now holds undisputed power, and that the Trade Union Congress holds no real power anymore.

While many anarchists outside the congress cheer this decision, mass arrests are already been carried out to hunt the enemies of the USA, and the future of the Commune now has become even more uncertain..."

Among those who came were Welsh Settlers, who established the community of Y Wladfa in 1865. While they are the most famous, there is also many other european settlements in the region. These settlements are seen as an example of cultural replacement by the Natives, and while these settlements will be allowed to stay for the sake of stability in our kingdom, we will have to decide whether we want to keep encouraging settlers to keep coming to our nation."

fopking.02.d:0 "Prior to colonization, the native Mapuche followed an extensive belief system. Their religion is similar to other native faiths found on the continent, being decentralized and largely centred around myths and spirits. While there have been many efforts to spread christianity into the region, there have always been holdouts of the old ways; in some cases even some merging of old mapuche myths into local legends. As part of our effort to gain support from Mapuche groups, many are calling on the king to recognise the old faith as the official religion in the kingdom. On the other hand there are the King's inner circle of advisors who are deeply influenced by highly catholic integralist teachings, they argue that we must dopt catholicism as our official faith and intensify efforts to spread the faith. Others members of the cabinet have suggested that we take neither side, and allow both groups to coexist and spread in peace in our nation. What should we decide?"

FOP_Miguel_Arcangel_Roscigna_desc:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1891년경, 아르헨티나, 부에노스 아이레스.\n§Y군사 경력:§W 1909년 무정부주의자 시몬 라도위츠키의 손에 의한 라몬 L. 팔콘 경찰청장의 암살로 영감을 받은 미겔 아르카넬 로시니아는 1910년대의 대부분의기간동안 무정부주의에 관심을 갖기 시작했으며, 몇몇 무정부주의 단체들에 참여하면서 무정부주의 문학들을 읽기 시작했습니다. 1924년에 그는 결심하고, 라도위츠키와 몇몇 무정부주의자들의 탈옥을 도와주기위해 우수아이아 교도소의 교도관으로 일했습니다. 그들은 아르헨티나 해안 경비대가 그들을 따라잡으려고 할 때 아폴리나리오 바레라와 칠레의 라몬 시푸엔테스, 에르네스토 메디나의 도움으로 성공적으로 탈출할 수 있었고 FOP에 도달할 수 있었습니다. 그 이후로 로시니아는 FOP의 민병대에 참여했고 탈퇴 후 그의 인기는 그가 자신의 군대를 이끌도록 선택되게 했습니다. 하지만 러시아 혁명의 사건들에 대해 알게 되면서, 그는 FOP 내의 공산주의자들을 경계하게 되었고, 그들의 영향력을 억누르고 방해하는 데 적극적으로 참여하게 되었습니다.\n§Y중요 참고 사항:§W- 라도위츠키와 부에나벤투라 두루티의 친한 친구입니다.\n- Aligned with the Radical anarchist faction.\n- 공산주의 세력에 강력히 반대합니다."
FOP_Kurt_Gustav_Wilckens_desc:0 "§Y장군 설명\n§Y출생:§W 1886년 11월 3일, 독일, 슐레스비히-홀슈타인 주, 바트 브람슈테트.\n§Y군사 경력:§W 정원사가 되기 위해 젊은 시절의 대부분을 공부한 그는 경제적 어려움으로 인해 1906년에 독일 군대에 입학하여 프로이센의 근위 소총 대대에 복무하였습니다. 그의 의무적인 4년간의 군 복무가 끝났을 때, 그는 정원을 가꾸는 것에 대해 더 배우기 위해 미국으로 갔고, 그곳이 그가 무정부주의에 대해 배웠던 곳이었습니다. 여러 번의 파업과 산업 사보타주에 참여한 후, 그는 1920년에 독일로 추방되었습니다. 미국에서 아르헨티나에서 무정부주의자가 성장하는 것에 대해 배웠던 그는 1920년 9월 29일 부에노스 아이레스에 도착하면서, 빠르게 새로운 세계를 향해 다시 한번 항했습니다. 그는 독일 지역 사회에서 파타고니아 총파업이 일어나기 전까지 FAUD가 후원하는 지역 신문인 'Der Syndikalist'에서 일했습니다. 이 사건에 대한 첫 몇 달 동안 거의 불신했던 윌켄스는 그의 동지들과 안드레스 바스케스 파레데스와 함께 남쪽으로 탈출하기로 결정했습니다. 극단적으로 평화주의적인 자세에도 불구하고, 그는 FOP의 민병대에 합류하기로 결정했고 그의 점잖은 태도와 신념은 그를 승진하게 만들었습니다.\n§Y중요 참고 사항:§W- 무정부주의적 이상을 위해 기꺼이 무기를 들고자 하지만 윌킨스는 모든 형태의 폭력을 경멸합니다.\n- Aligned with the Moderate Anarchist faction."
