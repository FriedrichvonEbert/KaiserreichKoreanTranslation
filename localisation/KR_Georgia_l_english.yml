POLITICS_JOACHIM_VON_PREUSSEN_DESC:0 "Prince Joachim Franz Humbert of Prussia was born in Berlin, on December 17, 1890, two years into the reign of his father Wilhelm II. Like his brothers, he attended elite schools and entered military service, eventually joining the 1st Foot Guards of the Royal Prussian Army, the most prestigious regiment in the German Empire. During the Weltkrieg, he served on the eastern front, but was wounded two months into the war and immediately sent home to Berlin. After returning, Joachim became engaged to the German noblewoman Marie Auguste von Anhalt, marrying her the next year. The couple had one child, Prince Karl Franz Joseph of Prussia, presently known as the Crown Prince Ioseb of Georgia. Joachim became quite a fixation among nascent states during the Weltkrieg, he was suggested as a potential monarch in Ireland, Finland and Poland but in all three cases, he was rejected, or passed up for other candidates. In 1917 the German diplomat Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg and monarchists in the Committee of Independent Georgia sought to install Joachim as king of Georgia, but the government of Noe Zhordania vigorously opposed it. Later, the idea was revived by the conservative general Shalva Maglakelidze and the staunch germanophile Georges V. Matchabelli, who pushed for a referendum on restoring the monarchy. Joachim took the crown and adopted the regnal name Ioachim, but the foreign prince has not made many public appearances, as he is known to be struggling with learning the Georgian language and personal issues related to his mental health. He has still made token efforts to endear himself to the people, and already enjoys a great deal of support among the nobility thanks to Matchabelli."
POLITICS_LEO_SHENGELAIA_DESC:0 "Leo was born in 1887 in the village of Obuji , in the Zugdidi region of Georgia. At an early age he sought an education in law. During his time at university he made contact with radical student groups and became a member of the Socialist Revolutionary party, becoming particularly interested in their programs for educational reform. In 1917 he formed a “Free University” with 5 other comrades, a small private school funded by the SRs, meant to educate the lower classes of Tbilisi. During his time as an administrator at the school he gained recognition for his papers on Georgia’s agrarian and labour issues, which eventually merited him a seat at the National Council of Georgia and a chance to affix his signature to the nation’s declaration of independence. Leo served within the Georgian parliament and steadily rose through the ranks of the SRs until a major schism appeared within the party in 1922, dividing the right leaning Socialist Revolutionaries from their left leaning counterparts. Leo joined the leftist politician Ivan Gobechia and assumed control of the party’s central committee, eventually being confirmed as its official leader a few years later with the left wing of the party’s and Gobechia’s support. He has thereafter served as a cautious supporter of the Social Democratic government of Georgia, unprepared to assume control of the government himself, but undaunted at the prospect of one day doing so."
POLITICS_GIORGI_BAGRATION_DESC:0 "The tale of house Bagration-Mukhrani begins with the rise of the early 16th century prince Bagrat, who was granted the fief of Mukhrani by his brother, the King of Georgia, but eventually rose to assume a great deal of autonomous power and gained de-facto sovereignty over his fiefdom. After the Russian conquest of Georgia, the lords of House Bagration and House Bagration-Mukhrani were regarded as equally powerful, but soon the Mukhrani branch began to gain more and more support in Russian politics, especially among Georgian nationalists. The elder branch of house Bagration eventually died out, leaving the Princes of Mukhrani as the next in line to the Georgian throne. The Bagration-Mukhrani’s claim was officially recognized when the throne was won by George Bagriation in the recent political referendum, restoring the Georgian monarchy. King George IX is considered a rather aloof man, with little political opinions of his own. He has been strongly influenced by his late father, Alexander, who died fighting the Bolsheviks, as well as his son Prince Irakli who is commonly considered a far more capable political schemer. This has left King George as a fairly easily manipulated figure, which frustrates much of the nobility. Nevertheless, the king is still a popular man among the common people. Even if he wasn’t invited as a signee, he gave his endorsement to the Georgian declaration of independence in 1918, and later enlisted as a soldier in the war against the Bolsheviks. It remains to be seen if this untrained, unprepared king can become a man in his own right, or if he will be defined by the influence of his son, his advisors, generals and prime minister."

It is a tiny, illegal organization that mostly meets in secret, and has begun to broaden their views to form more esoteric combinations of Communism and Georgian nationalism, noticeably adopting several elements of Western European Totalism.

In the aftermath of Georgian independence, the party mellowed its views to avoid censorship and suppression, and fear of drawing ire from the German hegemon.

In the late 19th century three groups emerged, fittingly dubbed the First, Second and Third Group, each with different ideas for how Georgian independence should be achieved. The Third Group, under the leadership of Noe Zhordania and Irakli Tsereteli embraced Marxist ideology and sought to meld Georgian nationalism with socialist beliefs. In 1903 the second crisis erupted, when the Third Group voted to join the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, despite the protests of prominent members like Noe Zhordania. This tenuous alliance did not last long, on the advent of the Russian Revolution many Georgia based members of the party decided to end their cooperation with the Russians, although some Georgians like Tsereteli remained faithful to Russian branch of the party. Zhordania emerged as the leader of the newly dubbed SSDP and helped establish an independent Georgian republic, guided by a mixture of socialism, humanism and nationalism, whilst rejecting the more extreme Bolshevik currents that had swept across the Eurasian labour movement.§!"

A critical moment emerged when the party leadership embraced violent revolutionary struggle, in line with the Socialist Revolutionaries’ “Combat Organization”, and began to endorse expropriations and violent reprisals against unjust landowners, despite condemnation from Georgian conservatives. This won them a great deal of support from the lower classes, and helped build a coalition with left-leaning and progressive parties throughout the Russian Empire. Following the Russian Revolution, the SSPRP joined forces with the Georgian social democrats and have been in a coalition ever since, but in time their agrarian focus has caused conflicts with the more urban, labour oriented policies adopted by the social democrats.

###events

geo.1.t:0 "조지아 민주공화국"
geo.1.d:0 "Georgia gained its independence during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, following its break from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. During the chaos, Georgia went to Germany for help in defending against the enemies surrounding the nation. Georgia signed multiple agreements with Germany, notably the Treaty of Poti, placing the country under the protection of Germany in exchange for several economic concessions which have resulted in a clear German dominance within the economy. Also in the Treaty of Batum, Georgia gave all of its Muslim majority regions to the Ottoman Empire. Following a short conflict with the now dead Republic of Armenia, Georgia gained Lori, and has since remained a peaceful and stable state.\n\nWhile a part of Russia, Georgia was a centre of Menshevik activity, which remained the case when it gained independence, with the Menshehvik Social Democratic Party of Georgia ruling since 1918. Following Noe Ramishvili's brief stint as Chairman in 1918, Noe Zhordania has ruled the country for 18 years solid. The Mensheviks have had complete political dominance over Georgia the whole time, though their vote count has shrunk over the years. In the election of 1935, the Mensheviks almost lost their majority, but were able to keep hold. The National Democratic Party, the EDP, garnered a large amount of votes, with their leader, Ekvtime Takaishvili beginning to work closer with monarchist groups. The popularity for a monarchy has grown over the years, with the two main candidates as king being Prince Joachim of Prussia, son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and George Bagration, head of the old Georgian royal family, the Bagrationi Dynasty.\n\nGeorgia stands as a beacon of stability in a world of growing uncertainty. Late last year, the old and popular Noe Zhordania announced he would resign as Chairman, to be replaced by Evgeni Gegechkori, who has worked in Zhordania's government since independence, though is notably less popular than him. However, unless disaster were to suddenly strike the nation, nothing is set to change politically until the next election in 1939."

geo.2.t:0 "포티 조약 재검토"
geo.2.d:0 "The Treaty of Poti was signed with Germany when Georgia was under direct threat from most of its neighbours, and wasn't internationally recognised. This is not how things stand anymore. Georgia has strong international recognition, and though tensions grow with its neighbours, some in the country argue that protection is not worth being stuck under the German fist. People specifically point to the fact the Treaty gives Germany great control over Georgia infrastructure, and set up a company that has great control over the Georgia mining industry. Though it would be economically beneficial in the short term, it would alienate our greatest economic partner in Germany, and set us on the anti-German path.\n\nPrince Joachim of Prussia recently announced that, should Georgia suspend the Treaty and nationalise the company, he would refuse any request to be enthroned, stating \"Georgia and Germany need each other\". On the other hand, George Bagration recently announced the opposite, that he would refuse to become monarch should Georgia stand by the Treaty, claiming \"Georgia has lived too long under the fist of Germany. Now is our only chance to stop this.\"\n\nThe foreign policy implications of the decision are massive. By sticking to the treaty, we reaffirm our loyalty to both Germany and, by connection, their strong ally the Ottoman Empire. However, if we were to end the treaty, it would allow us to act more aggressively, and take back territory that our nation claims, like Batum, currently under the control of the Ottomans."

The Baku-Poti Pipeline was funded mostly by the Azeri government, even though a massive amount of it goes through Georgia and the trade from it happened at Poti, in our land. Some of the more nationalistic in our government have suggested that to help finish solving the Black Monday crisis, we should nationalise the Pipeline, and take its profits for ourselves. Relations between Azerbaijan and Georgia have always been tense, stemming mostly from Azeri control of Zaqatala, a city claimed by Georgia. "

These protests have been led by multiple of parties in Georgia, everywhere from Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP to Leo Shengelaia's SRs. Though wildly different, they all ask for the same thing: new elections. At the protests, Ekvtime Takaishvili spoke to a large crowd, about how the situation of Georgia has changed since last year, and the current government is unfit to fix it.

However, with his popularity beginning to faulter following some failed reforms and the economy stagnating, Zhordania decided it was his time to retire.\n\nHis replacement, Evgeni Gegechkori, has worked closely with Zhordania over his 18 years of leadership, serving in his cabinet at Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice and Minister for Internal Affairs. Due to the relative stability of Georgia at the current time, and decent economic outlooks, the public should have time to get to like Gegechkori just as much as they like Zhordania."

The EDP, on the other hand, are campaigning on the failures of the current government, primarily the failures of the government to quickly deal with the Black Monday crisis.

It started off peaceful, though throughout the day more and more counter protesters, mostly coming from left wing parties and groups, began to join against the Tetri Giorgi rally. Following a few light clashes between the socialists and monarchists, the police were forced to step in to try to split the groups. However, both sides saw it as the police trying to suppress their side, and so the violence got worse, leading to large brawls between socialists, monarchists and police.

However, other officers have said that this is too risky, and that cornering the People's Guard inside the city will force our troops to fight all their forces at once to their deaths.

The Constitution of 1921, a work of constitutional art, was reviewed, but was decided it still worked and was not the reason Cholokashvili and Bagration were able to take over. Jugheli instead blames the courts made to defend the constitution. He dismissed any judges that tried to give Cholokashvili's regime legitimacy, and emphasised it is the courts that must protect the political institutions of Georgia."
geo.54.a:0 "Georgia will always be a republic!"
geo.55.t:0 "Jugheli Announces New Elections"
geo.55.d:0 "Today, in a speech outside parliament, Valiko Jugheli announced to a large crowd of people that new elections would be held in a months time. He claimed that the EDP, by allowing the referendum, was partly responsible for the dictatorial takeover, and therefore the people deserve to vote once again on a new parliament. The announcement was met with cheering by the crowd, happy to see that democracy was once again going to take place in the country."
geo.55.a:0 "Excellent."
geo.56.t:0 "Georgia turns their back on Germany"
geo.56.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Georgia was born with sponsorship from the German Empire. To secure their independence in the turbulent times of the Russian Revolution, the Georgian government signed the Treaty of Poti, a treaty that gave Germany vast economic power in the country. In the wake of the Black Monday crisis and the collapse of the Georgian economy, Georgia has decided to declare the Treaty of Poti at an end, and has instead decided to take an anti-German stance, using nationalism to gather support for their government. Some of the more jingoistic in their government have even discussed retaking Batum from us."
geo.56.a:0 "Something to keep an eye on."
geo.57.t:0 "Georgia Mobilises for War!"
geo.57.d:0 "With war breaking out in the Middle East, the Georgian government has ramped up its attacks against the Empire in speeches, proclaiming that Georgians suffering under Ottoman rule will soon be \"freed\". This, along with a sudden influx of troops on the border, can only mean one thing: Georgia will soon declare war on the Empire."
geo.57.a:0 "Damn."

geo.60.t:0 "The King's Cabinet"
geo.60.d:0 "With the country now securely under our new regimes control, it is now time to create a cabinet for the country, made up of our allies.\n\nKakutsa Cholokashvili, who brought about the new government, will remain in his position as Prime Minister. King George's son, Prince Irakli, assisted in the coup, and is far more politically active and able than his father. He will become Foreign Minister. Shalva Maglakelidze is a retired general, now one of the most popular of the Tetri Giorgi. A Germanophile and extreme nationalist, he wants the role of Minister of the Interior, but it was decided he is far too ideological for the position. Better off to put him in a high level position where he cannot too heavily influence the ideology of the government. Therefore, he will become the Economy Minister. Leo Kereselidze is another ex-general, who led the Georgian Legion in the First Weltkrieg. Leader of the Tetri Giorgi, it is decided he will become Minister of the Interior."
geo.60.a:0 "An excellent government."
geo.61.t:0 "Georgia Requests to Join the Reichspakt"
geo.61.d:0 "During the First Weltkrieg, we helped secure Georgia as an ally in the Caucasus. Their government has remained friendly to ours since their independence, and now, with international order under threat, they have requested to join our alliance."
geo.61.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt."
geo.61.b:0 "We decline."
geo.62.t:0 "Germany Has Accepted!"
geo.62.d:0 "Germany has accepted our request to join the Reichspakt"
geo.62.a:0 "Excellent."
geo.63.t:0 "Germany Has Declined!"
geo.63.d:0 "Germany has declined our request to join the Reichspakt"
geo.63.a:0 "Damn."
geo.64.t:0 "Georgia Demands Zaqatala"
geo.64.d.AZR:0 "Georgia has claimed the town of Zaqatala for decades, but in the post-1st Weltkrieg agreement, we gained control of it. However, now Georgia has come to us, now at war, and demanded we hand the town over to them, and state that if we decline, it will mean war."
geo.64.d.not_AZR:0 "Georgia has claimed the town of Zaqatala for decades, but in the post-1st Weltkrieg agreement, Azerbaijan gained control of it. However, now Georgia has come to us, requesting we hand the town over to them. While this is an insolent tone, perhaps conceding their request is better than risking a needless war over a worthless province?"
geo.64.a:0 "We have no choice but to hand it over."
geo.64.b:0 "We cannot be pushed around! We will fight for it."
geo.65.t:0 "Azerbaijan Hands Over Zaqatala"
geo.65.d:0 "Azerbaijan has handed over the town of Zaqatala, fearing a war on 2 fronts."
geo.65.a:0 "Wonderful."
geo.66.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refused!"
geo.66.d:0 "Azerbaijan has refused to hand over the town of Zaqatala. We threatened war in our demand, so now would be the time."
geo.66.a:0 "This means war!"
geo.66.b:0 "Maybe not..."
geo.67.t:0 "Elections to the People's Council of Abkhazia"
geo.67.d:0 "The People's Council of Abkhazia, the devolved body established in the early days of the republic to represent the Abkhaz people, has recently held it local elections across the Abkhazia region. The establishment of the People's Council allowed the Abkhaz people to not feel intimidated or threatened by the central government, and to give them a voice in their region. The elections took place without a hitch, with more left-wing nationalist groups gaining control of the council."
geo.67.a:0 "Democracy is good."
geo.68.t:0 "Autonomy Question for South Ossetia"
geo.68.d:0 "With the elections to the People's Council of Abkhazia a few weeks ago, people in the region of South Ossetia have begun to ask themselves why they do not have their own devolved body. Following the South Ossetian uprisings that ended in 1920, the region of South Ossetia had been relatively peaceful, and self determination for the South Ossetian people faded to an obscure idea only held by intellectual circles. However, following the economic and subsequent political disasters in 1936, tensions once again flared up in the region, and with many remembering the violence of the early days of the republic, the a military detachment was sent to the region all the way until the election. Now that the people of Abkhazia have exercised their local democracy, the question that is beginning to enter the mainstream is whether the South Ossetian people deserve the same."
geo.68.a:0 "Hopefully this is settled peacefully."
geo.69.t:0 "South Ossetia Autonomy March in Tskhinvali"
geo.69.d:0 "The minor groups that have been fighting for South Ossetian autonomy seem to have finally broken into the mainstream, with mass support for a pro-autonomy march that has taken place in Tskhinvali, the capital of the South Ossetian region. Though there was no violence between protesters and police, there are fears that if demonstrations like this continue, more extremist elements of this movement might enter the mainstream."
geo.69.a:0 "Oh dear..."
geo.70.t:0 "People's Council of Abkhazia Endorses South Ossetian Autonomy"
geo.70.d:0 "The left-wing controlled People's Council of Abkhazia has officially announced that they, and therefore the Abkhazian region they represent, endorse the idea of a devolved body for the people of South Ossetia. It has become clear that this is something that we cannot ignore, and many in government demand a response, lest the unrest in the South Ossetian region grow."
geo.70.a:0 "Establish a People's Council of South Ossetia."
geo.70.b:0 "We cannot be pressured into this."
geo.71.t:0 "People's Council of South Ossetia Established"
geo.71.d:0 "Final preparations have been made, and a new People's Council of South Ossetia has been established, to represent the people of South Ossetia. A provisional government has been appointed until official elections to the council can take place. Protests in the region have ceased, and though there are still some calling for all out independence, it is limited to intellectual circles, and the masses are generally content."
geo.71.a:0 "Thank goodness."
geo.72.t:0 "South Ossetians Begin to Arm Themselves"
geo.72.d:0 "After being endorsed by the People's Council of Abkhazia, many South Ossetians assumed that autonomy was on the way. When this desire for autonomy was rejected by our government, many have instead come to the conclusion that a crackdown in the region was on the way. Therefore, many South Ossetians in the region, remembering the multiple conflicts that have occurred in the region, have begun to arm themselves with weapons smuggled in from the north. There is still a chance to end any danger of conflict if autonomy for the region is announced. Instead, it'd be a good idea to increase the military presence there."
geo.72.a:0 "Increase military presence."
geo.72.b:0 "No need for bloodshed, establish a People's Council of South Ossetia."
geo.73.t:0 "Military Police Kill Three Protesters"
geo.73.d:0 "Following further protests across the South Ossetia region, military police were forced to establish a permanent presence there. After a few hours of protests in Tskhinvali, a fire was started, which, after being blamed on the protesters, led to clashes between military police and protesters. The situation quickly deteriorated, and a riot quickly broke out. During clashes throughout the night, many people were injured, and three rioters were killed. With news of the deaths spreading across the South Ossetian region, tensions have flared, and we should expect a reaction from the people."
geo.73.a:0 "Guess this can't be solved peacefully..."
geo.74.t:0 "South Ossetian Rebels Attack Military Base"
geo.74.d:0 "Following the deaths of protesters a few days ago, a group of disorganised South Ossetian rebels have gathered together and attacked a military base near the northern border. Though the military presence there was able to quickly pacify the attackers, it led to the deaths of 13 South Ossetians and 4 Georgian troops. It is clear that something drastic must be done to defuse the situation. We could finally give in to the South Ossetians demands for autonomy, or crack down on them hard, to finally crush any desire for autonomy by force."
geo.74.a:0 "Its time to give in and establish autonomy for them."
geo.74.b:0 "Crack down hard militarily."
geo.75.t:0 "Military Crackdown in South Ossetia"
geo.75.d:0 "Following tensions flaring in the South Ossetian region, the military has been sent in to crush any further resistance in the area. Many of the ringleaders of the protests and riots have been arrested, and the protests have been broken up by force. Though there have been clashes with rebels, they have quickly been put down by the military. South Ossetia is secure."
geo.75.a:0 "Excellent."




geo.120.t:0 "1936 Election"
geo.120.d:0 "Following the chaos caused by Black Monday and the failures of the SSDP government, Evgeni Gegechkori was forced to call a new election, a election he knew he was likely to lose. Today, with people going out to the polls, it looks like it'll be close, with no party able to get a sole majority. It is likely the EDP-MMEP coalition will win overall, though it might be possible for the SSDP to scrape a minority victory."
geo.120.a:0 "The Menshevik SSDP survive with a minority."
geo.120.b:0 "The EDP-MMEP Coalition wins a majority."
geo.121.t:0 "The SSDP Coalition Question"
geo.121.d:0 "Though the SSDP was victorious in the election, no party has enough seats to form a majority government. Therefore, a coalition is necessary. One can either be formed with the federalist, nationalist and decentralist SSPRP, or the radically socialist SR. Both parties have made clear they are open to a coalition."
geo.121.a:0 "Form a coalition government with the SSPRP."
geo.121.b:0 "Form a coalition government with the SR."
geo.122.t:0 "[GetYear] Election"
geo.122.d:0 "After weeks of campaigning, it looks likely to be a close election, with both parties being forced into a coalition. The party with the most seats is..."
geo.122.a:0 "...the SSDP."
geo.122.b:0 "...the EDP-MMEP Coalition."
geo.123.t:0 "The SSDP Coalition Question"
geo.123.d:0 "Though the SSDP was victorious in the election, no party has enough seats to form a majority government. Therefore, a coalition is necessary.
