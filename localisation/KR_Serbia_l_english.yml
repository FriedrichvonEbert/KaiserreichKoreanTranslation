 POLITICS_DRAGISA_VASIC_DESC:0 "드라고미르 "드라기샤" 바시치는 1931년 공화당의 주도적 계획에 따라 선출된 세르비아 역사상 두 번째 대통령입니다. 1885년 모라바에서 태어난 바시치는 불행하게도 발칸 전쟁과 세계대전의 참호속에서 죽을 날만 기다리는 세대의 청년 중 하나였습니다. 제 2차 발칸 전쟁 동안에 그의 안에서 혁명가 바시치와 작가 바시치가 움트기 시작하였습니다. 그는 첫번째 작품인, "파치코"라는 단편 소설속에서, 브레갈니차 전투 속의 한 세르비아 군인을 묘사하였습니다. 그 군인은 쓰러진 한 불가리아의 장교를 불쌍히 여겨, 무인지대안에서 그를 묻어주려고 하지만, 나무로 만든 십자가를 세우려는 순간 적의 총탄에 맞고 쓰러지게 되었습니다. 작품속에서도 보여지는 그의 혁명적 열정은 특히 살로니카 재판이후로 카라조르제비치 왕조에 대한 환멸로 이어지게 되는데,  검은손의 일원 중 하나가 그의 사촌인 류보미르 불로비치를 처형했기 때문입니다. \n\n 세계대전 직후, 바시치는 망명에서 돌아와 법조계에서 종사하였으며, "진보"라는 신문을 창간 했습니다. 하지만, 곧 폐간되었고 그의 변호사 생활은 공산주의자들을 옹호했다는 이유로 왕실 정부에의해 자격증이 정지 되었습니다. 이에대한 대응으로, 그는 공화당에 입당했고, 그의 문학적 재능뿐만 아니라 세르비아 군 내무에 수많은 연줄 덕분에 저항조직 내에서 가장 중요한 멤버인 이사회 멤버가 될 수 있었습니다. 혁명이 일어나자 비시치는 이에 동참했고, 스쿱슈티나(국민회의)에서 프랑스 코뮌의 대사로서 선출 되었습니다. 파리를 방문했을때 그들의 성취를 목도한 그는 비록 생디칼리스트로 전향하지는 않았지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 꽤나 그를 매료시키는 것이었습니다. \n\n 콘스피라치야(비밀결사)가 야샤 프로다노비치 대통령의 반-군부적 입장을 점점 의심하게 되면서 1931년 그를 권좌에서 몰아냈습니다. 비밀결사는 조심스럽게 바시치를 다음 선거에서 대통령이 되도록 종용하였습니다. 바시치가 검은손에 대한 과거 사건으로 말미암아 통제를 잘할 것으로 여기면서 말입니다. 이에 마지못해, 동의하게 되었고, 오늘날 그는 자신의 진보에대한 관점과 비밀결사에 대한 부채의식 사이에서 고민하는 지도자로 서 있습니다. 그에게 있어 불가리아와의 결전은 단지 불승복에 대한 문제가 아니라 자유에대한 문제입니다. 불가리아인들이 어설프게 절대적 헤게모니에 손을 대는 동안, 세르비아인들은 발칸반도에서 자신들이 등불임을 여러 차례 입증해 왔습니다. 하지만 세르비아가 정말 발칸의 자유의 전조라고 주장할 수 있을까요?"

 POLITICS_PETAR_ZIVKOVIC_DESC:0 "To his enemies, he is known as a deadly intricate webweaver, a nefarious puppetmaster who held Aleksandar II hostage and crafted the infamous Royal Dictatorship following the Weltkrieg. To his followers, he is known as the most loyal a monarchist could possibly be, a soldier who has stood by the House of Karađorđević as long as he lived. Petar Živković was born in 1879 and followed the prestigious career of military service. He rose to become a member of the Royal Guard, a position in which he played a crucial role during the events in 1903, as he was the guard who opened the entrance to the Royal Court and allowed the Black Hand to extinguish the House of Obrenović. Živković soon became disillusioned with the Black Hand, however, believing that their leader Apis was plotting to overthrow the Karađorđevićs as well. Following the advice of Crown Prince Aleksandar, Petar created the White Hand - a rival to the Black Hand, dedicated to the protection of the ruling dynasty.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, Živković disposed of his Black Hand rivals at last, sentencing Apis and his comrades to death in the Thessaloniki Process. Though Serbia lost the war, his power only continued to grow. It was his advice that Aleksandar followed when proclaiming the Obznana and declaring the Royal Dictatorship. Some even rumoured that he held the King's dirty secrets, forcing the monarch to dance to his will. Unfortunately, as powerful as he was, he could not predict, nor prevent, the Revolution. In the midst of the monarchy's collapse, he made sure to secure the two-year-old heir, Petar II, and place him in the hands of Prince Pavle in Canada. The White Hand transformed into a secret society, taking revenge on the Republican officers, sowing terror and plotting their return to power. Always more accustomed to court politics than terrorism, Živković despised this change, instead spending his time in exile coordinating his underlings. Waiting for the moment to return - until, someday, he can finally right the wrongs of the last decade."

 POLITICS_IVAN_MIHAJLOV_DESC:0 "Ivan Mihajlov was born in 1896, to a Bulgarian speaking family in the mountains of Macedonia. A region soon ripped and torn by ethnic tensions and war. Even his life is a good glimpse into rapid-fire changes which the region had to endure. Mihajlov began his studies in a Bulgarian men's high school in Thessaloniki before it was closed by the Greek administration during the First Balkan War.  Thus he briefly transferred to a Serbian one in Skopje, before finally finishing his education in Bulgarian-occupied Macedonia. Finally moving on to study law in Sofia. During the Weltkrieg, Mihajlov enlisted in the Bulgarian army, and came into personal contact with IMRO leader Todor Aleksandrov.\n\nAfter the war, Mihajlov became Aleksandrov's personal secretary. The IMRO, having accomplished its goals at last, dissolved. To consolidate their gains, Aleksandrov led Mihajlov and the right-wing faction of the organisation into the "Association Against Serbian Bandits". A paramilitary organisation tasked with eradicating Serbian resistance and paving the way for the Bulgarisation of the Western Provinces. In time, the Association transformed into the Ohrana, an intimidating Macedonian paramilitary and a far-right haven.\n\nIn 1930, injured by a Serbian Chetnik ambush, Aleksandrov retired from an active role in the organisation. His protege Mihajlov assumed his stead. He fully embraced Ohrana's alliance with the National Legions and volunteered for the Fourth Balkan War alongside hundreds of his peers.  When the war ended with his home seized by the Serbs yet again, he chose to follow his mentor's footsteps. Alongside his fellow Macedonian veterans and refugees, Mihajlov infiltrated the Serbian-Bulgarian border and proclaimed the restoration of the IMRO.  Intent to free Macedonia from the oppressors in Belgrade no matter how much blood is shed along the way."

Instead, the conflict takes place in the form of round-based Decisions, a game played by Serbia and AI-controlled IMRO where both sides have to guess the point of attack of the other. If Serbia §Yreinforces§! the same region which IMRO §Yattacks§!, they win a round - if IMRO §Yattacks§! a region which is not §Ydefended§!, they win a round. \n   Best of three wins the Lull round - and the winner either increases or decreases Resistance in the state.\n\n - While in §YAction Phase§!, the ban from moving troops into Macedonia is lifted, but both sides remain hamstrung by massive debuffs to §YDivision Speed§!, §YAttack§! and §YAttrition§!. If Resistance is low enough, Serbia may §Yinitiate an offensive§!, removing Macedonia's debuffs for the remainder of the phase and allowing the Serbian player to invade and take as many Provinces as they can in the timeframe. If all IMRO provinces are taken, the organisation is shattered and the rebellion ends. If Serbia fails to take all of the provinces in the timeframe, however, the offensive fails and the situation resets.\n\nDuring the rebellion, both Serbia and IMRO have access to focus trees with which they can impede the progress of their opponent.\n\nBeware - if Resistance reaches 100 percent or Skopje falls, §RMacedonia will be lost!§!\n"

While "Moravian Serbia", centred in Belgrade, is their core, Serbs are distributed across all of Yugoslavia - in Croatia, Bosnia, Vojvodina and Macedonia, most notably. Serbs living in the first three are commonly referred to as Prečani ("those across the river"), and were the strongest supporters of Illyrian unification with Serbia.§!\n\nOur §YEthnic Relations§! with this group are Level §Y[?YUG_serbia_relations_level]/10§!.\nThis group demands §Y[?YUG_serbia_pp_requirement]§!

Though the bulk of Croatia's political establishment was satisfied with the formation of Illyria after the Weltkrieg, this is by no means a universal belief.

Here, serfdom remained longer than elsewhere in Europe, only abolished in the 1920s, and the Bosniak estates continue to dominate the countryside.

 serbia.0.d:0 "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist, was the catalyst which caused the beginning of the Weltkrieg. Though Serbian forces fought valiantly and earned the world's respect by stalling the Central Powers advance for months, by late 1915 the entirety of the country ended up occupied. Divided into Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian occupation zones, Serbia was exploited and burned, its adversaries seeking to enact revenge upon what they saw as a barbaric regime. This only emboldened resistance in the territory, however, and things on both sides of the front changed by 1918. Austria-Hungary, pressured by its German allies, finally began peace talks, while the Serbian resistance in Corfu, seeing the pitiful state of the Entente, came to the conclusion that even a bitter peace is better than annexation. King Petar abdicated and his son took the throne as Aleksandar II, who signed the punitive Treaty of Wartholz in 1919 - it restored a rump Serbia in the Austro-Hungarian occupation zone, forever tied to the Austrian sphere of influence.\n\nAn emboldened socialist movement in Belgrade, inspired by the Russian and French revolutions, and the opposition of the People's Radical Party got Aleksandar II to respond harshly. Political life was suspended, the socialist movement banned, and a Royal Dictatorship ushered in to maintain order in the defeated nation. This act only inflamed tensions in the country by the end, however, and it boiled over to revolution in 1925. The military, organised into the Konspiracija secret society, made an act of defiance against their King and orchestrated an assassination of Aleksandar II on December 3rd, which led the Royal Dictatorship to its collapse. Prime Minister Vojislav Veljković, surrendered to the opposition, which proclaimed a Serbian Republic.\n\nAfter a brief diplomatic standoff, the provisional government of Ljubomir Stojanović recognised the Treaty of Wartholz, and Vienna recognised the Republican government in turn. Today, Serbia stands as a burning symbol of democracy in the Balkans - at least on the surface. In truth, however, while the government may proclaim heartwarming goals like peace, welfare and prosperity, nothing in the Serbian government happens without the approval of the Konspiracija. This military secret society, deliberately styled after the Black Hand, seeks one thing and one thing only - the liberation of all Serbs outside of the Republic's borders. Again in the shadows, another conspiracy lurks as well - the White Hand, led by Petar Živković, which waits for a chance to overthrow the Republican interregnum and restore the underage son of Aleksandar II.\n\nAs 1936 begins, Serbia is still, nominally, a client state of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but this grip grows looser by the second, and once it finally falls, all of Serbia's enemies may tremble."

And yet, despite it all, Serbia endured, slowly rebuilding a stable, if weakened economy based around agricultural production and free trade. The reforms by King Aleksandar II's Prime Minister, Vojislav Veljković, were not undone by the Republican government, and so the stable Serbian dinar he fought for remained throughout the 1930s.\n\nThe collapse of the Berlin stock market has undone most of that work. Though Serbia is not as tied to the German economy as other countries in the region, the collapse of worldwide trade has tanked our agricultural exports and so left much of the economy in a void. A package of response measures and reforms is already being prepared, but the populace, hit straight in the pocket, no longer holds as much trust in the Republican Party.

The government structure of Serbia is semi-presidential - the President is elected by the legislature, much like the Prime Minister, but has considerable power in domestic policy and the appointment of public officials, alongside the usual duties of representation of the state in foreign affairs. While the Prime Minister is dependant on the backing of the Skupština, the President serves a predetermined five year term no matter what is taking place in the legislature. That is not to say that he is all-powerful, however, and he needs parliamentary support for pretty much all appointments and legislation.\n\nThe electoral campaign in Serbia began late last year and continues into 1936.

It is at this day in 1389 that the medieval Kingdom of Serbia defended its independence against the Ottoman Empire in the Battle of Kosovo, an event which forged the national myth of the Serbian people for centuries to come. Ever since 1918, however, the commemoration of the day has been silent and modest. It was the day when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo, an act many Serbs still cannot live past, for it has brought them so much destruction and loss. During the reign of Aleksandar II, a small monument was erected in Gazimestan to honour those who fell in the battle, but the observations there remained small.\n\n1936 was different. President Dragomir Vasić himself attended the observations in Gazimestan, drawing large masses of Serbs to visit the monument for the first time. There, to thousands of his countrymen, he made a speech - and the language was shocking. For the first time since the end of the Weltkrieg, the leader of Serbia declared that what they all experienced twenty years ago was a national humiliation - it robbed Serbia of its ancestral lands and people in Niš and Macedonia, and Serbia must not rest until it finds a way to return them to Belgrade's fold. The heroes and martyrs commemorated during Vidovdan fought for a free and united Serbia, after all, and the only way to honour their memory is to overthrow the shackles holding Serbia back today.\n\nThe speech was met with applause and patriotic chants. While Vasić's political opponents may denounce this as electoral pandering, everyone can tell that this marks a sharp turn in the history of Serbia - that it will no longer abide by the Treaty of Wartholz, and forge an independent destiny instead."

They compete for this niche with the Socialist Party of Serbia, however - a reformist breakaway from the SRP composed of its moderate wing, which generally serves as the mediator between the Republicans and the Socialist Workers.

This has made agrarian issues an important talking point in the election, and several parties have been isolated as the front-runners in the valuable farmer voting bloc. The Agrarian Party, run by Milan Gavrilović and Jovan Jovanović-Pižon have traditionally represented farming interests, but have yet to escape from the opposition.

Being the most vocal democratic faction in opposition to the King, it swiftly built up support and championed the Republican revolution. In the Serbian republic, it is the more left-wing of the two main establishment parties, the other being the People's Radical Party.\n\nInto the election of 1936, the Republicans go in with everything to lose - they have been in power for the past ten years, under presidents Prodanović and Vasić, and now face opposition from the left and the right. If they seek to remain in power, they need to prevent the centre from collapsing and ensure that neither the Radicals nor the Socialist Workers are able to muster a majority without them.

It had a falling out with the monarchy immediately after the war ended, however, as King Aleksandar II's personal distaste for Pašić led to his dismissal, the party moving to the opposition, and finally to the underground. It reluctantly supported the Republican Revolution of 1925 and stands as the more right-wing of the two main establishment parties in Serbia.\n\nThe Radicals, led by Milan Stojadinović, are in a comfortable position. While the left is infighting, the right is largely united, as the Radicals and Agrarians have a lot of shared ground, while minor parties like the Democratic State Party and Ljotić's royalist radicals are nothing to worry about.

It was banned by the Obznana during Aleksandar II's regime, but continued operating in the underground, supported the Republican revolution and joined parliamentary politics as the leftmost legal party in the Skupština.\n\nThe Socialist Workers' Party has to fight an uphill battle in the election. Even if they can harness enough anti-establishment rhetoric to achieve a plurality, they always have to worry about the possibility of an anti-socialist grand coalition between the Republicans and Radicals.

By 1925, however, only the hardcore Royalists among their ranks chose to resist the fall of the monarchy, leaving the first few months of the Republic somewhat unstable - whereas many stood down and accepted the change in regime if it means that the dream of Greater Serbia can continue. Chetnik associations have since been reestablished and began to rearm themselves, but their loyalty to republicanism is still questioned.\n\nThe recent rise of the Socialist Workers' Party has left the "loyalist" Chetniks far more than worried, however. While they can begrudgingly tolerate a republic, a possible socialist regime is completely intolerable - and so, Chetnik voivodes such as Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin have reached out to the government, demanding something to be done - or else they will take matters to their own hands.

His career, both in political and literary affairs, preceded him for decades before the Revolution too, and he had served in ministerial positions as early as before the Weltkrieg. However, staunchly opposed to militarism and authoritarianism, he came into conflict with the Konspiracija secret society and so ultimately chose to not seek reelection - because of this, and his later support for anti-Konspiracija endeavours, rumours are abound that it was they who signed off his life.\n\nThe officers and generals in their lodges and circles understandably feel threatened - as omnipotent as their control over Serbia may feel sometimes, their network has always been fragile, and now that we have chosen to resist their influence openly, they have given us a warning.

A leading role in this movement has been assumed by Ivan Mihajlov, a Macedonian war veteran, reserve officer and law professor in Sofia, who served as an aide to the legendary leader of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, Todor Aleksandrov.\n\nToday, our law enforcement authorities report that Mihajlov and several dozens of Macedonian veterans have vanished, and rumours tell that they have secretly crossed the Serbian-Bulgarian border. And it appears that they crossed it well prepared, with weaponry and supplies to boot."

An ultranationalist, revolutionary terror group, the IMRO long fought for a Bulgarian Macedonia, with brutal pre-Weltkrieg uprisings in Ilinden and Tikveš against any power that got in the way of their so-called ‘liberation’ of the Macedonian region. Since the Weltkrieg, Bulgaria’s hegemony in the region has seen the IMRO go into a form of limbo, fading into history with their goal achieved.\n\nOur recent reclamation of Macedonia was always expected to be difficult to consolidate, but today the National Assembly has received word that Bulgarian colonel and revolutionary Ivan Mihajlov has restored the organisation, declaring an open war against Belgrade in the process. The group will no doubt get support, clandestine or otherwise, from Bulgarian elements which in turn will embolden their actions. If we do not crush them swiftly, then military officials worry that the partisans may not be beatable at all."

Armed Macedonian bands, the Chetas, infiltrate the rest of Macedonia from the organisation's headquarters in the mountains, against which the Serbian Army and law enforcement responds with regular patrols and similarly small-scale organisation. Our resources in this war are limited, however. Should we defend the larger cities in the north such as Skopje? Or should we focus on the rural mountainous south?"

Since then, they have seized effective control of the region. Our authorities and any of their attempts to maintain order there have been powerless, and Mihajlov's organisation has established a 'state within a state' there - with their own army, law enforcement, and even taxation.

Though we have hastily increased security measures to keep our commanders safe, the IMRO's work has had the effect they wanted - the Serbian Army reels from the damage caused, even a few of our highest commanding officers have been incapacitated and will not be able to return to the front lines for some time."

In the end, a temporary retreat from the region has been called, to consolidate the army's positions in the north and cut unnecessary losses.\n\nSkopje, the capital of Macedonia, is now a picturesque sight. Burning Serbian memorabilia in bonfires, triumphantly standing atop of buildings and mosques, Macedonian militants wave their red-black banner and chant the words of the "Rise the Dawn of Freedom", the hymn of the Macedonian revolutionaries. Representatives from all liberated regions of Macedonia have gathered in the capital and proudly declared Ivan Mihajlov to be the first president of the Independent State of Macedonia.\n\nAs its first act, the constituent assembly of Macedonia declared the 'restoration of immortal, historical ties between the peoples of Vardar Macedonia and Bulgaria' and sent an official diplomatic note to the government in Sofia, requesting the return of Bulgarian troops to their rightful soil.

Today, after twenty years of rest and preparation, the Serbs are once again at war, with the exact same goal in mind.\n\nI recognize the hesitation of my peers and the people of Serbia, having suffered greatly the last time this has happened. I believe that Nikola Pašić had the same hesitation in his heart when the first Austrian shells fell upon Belgrade and we were subject to the torment of their occupation. And to ensure that this does not happen again, I propose a regime of national unity, a period in which all Serbs will be able to set their differences aside and work together for a joint future.

 serbia.58.d:0 "Throughout the past few years, democracy in Serbia has been increasingly eroded - and today, it is unrecognisable from the militant republic it had been a mere few years ago. The Council of National Unification still stands, technically, but the parties which haven't already withdrawn from its membership have long since been turned into controlled opposition, mere puppets to pretend that Serbia is now anything but a one-man dictatorship. Political crackdowns are now commonplace and elections are suspended permanently. The Konspiracija, seen by a few as a guarantee of the Republic, now stands completely behind the President - his regime has made Serbia stronger than anyone could have expected, and it's no secret that quite a few officers in the military like his style of rule...\n\nToday, only one question is left to answer - where shall Stojadinović lead Serbia next? The masses of uniformed paramilitaries on the streets and the corporatist clique in charge will both follow the President wherever he will go. Should he merely draft a new, authoritarian constitution to maintain his regime for decades? Or should he tap into a small, long suppressed, but nevertheless existing monarchist current deep within the Radical Party? Pašić and his party never truly broke their vows to the House of Karađorđević, and now that republicanism has been completely destroyed, could anyone stop Stojadinović from inviting the heir to the throne to serve as his puppet?"

Niš, Skopje, and other cities once ripped from Serbia are once again a part of the nation. And it was not merely a successful war which the regime of the left has brought. Already, important social reforms have been put into place, their first dividends trickling down to the people below - a show of generosity which the frustrated masses will not forget in a while.\n\nThe strength of the government among the people is greater than ever."

Even it has failed to stop the ongoing cause of the revolution, however - its old conservative generals are now retired in their cabins, removed from power, all while a new guard of uppity officers are running the military-like petty kings.\n\nThe strength of the government among the military is greater than ever."

Though observers initially predicted that the Socialists and Republicans will work as a moderate force against the revolutionary SRP, this has proven to not be the case. One after another, these moderates have either been frightened into going with the SRP's policies or changed their ideological positions entirely, engulfed by a wave of revolutionary sentiment which permeates all of Serbian society today. Even the members of the Skupština who are in opposition can do little to make things change - the power of the legislature is increasingly being eroded.\n\nThe strength of the government among high politics is greater than ever."

Besieged by reactionaries seeking to extinguish democracy and restore the monarchy, he has no choice but to call a state of emergency and begin the thorough transformation of the state to ensure that the interests of the people are forever guarded. In Belgrade, Niš, Podgorica and other cities, popular militias were seizing power from local authorities and enacting justice upon all they deem enemies of the people. The army, paralysed by purges and losing out in its influence, had little power to stop the uprising, and one after the other, its leadership were being arrested for charges real or imaginary.\n\nIn the midst of the burning revolutionary flame, the Serbian Socialist Republic has been proclaimed - and the Socialist Workers' Party as its sole legal party."

A year has passed since, however, and little has been accomplished thus far. While some achievements have indeed been put into place, the lack of action against the enemies of the workers has left a large radical wing of the party alienated.\n\nConvinced that the SRP has betrayed the cause of socialism and become a class-collaborationist party, rather than one which fights for a worker's revolution, this wing has broken away, initiating the collapse of the Party into several movements. President Trifun Kaclerović now only commands the moderates of the party in the Skupština, and although they have now merged with the moderate Socialists, they no longer command a majority in the legislature and will hardly be able to command majority support for their plans from there on out. Chances are that the voters will not be kind to the Socialists in the next election, either..."

These ten years of exile have had a toll on many of them - coping with the loss of the monarchy was difficult, and the conditions of exile hardened their resolve. The rise of the Iron Guard in Romania had its effect as well - it showed to Serbian monarchists a way how the monarchy can not only survive, but be strengthened and its energy rejuvenated for the modern age.\n\nHaving returned home, these radical monarchists have joined forces with Dimitrije Ljotić - one of the few monarchists who participated in the elections in the Serbian republic, and whose far-right ideas are in close accord with the movement. To them, the restoration of the monarchy is only the beginning of the journey. The Kingdom fell for a reason, it became too passive and did not mobilize the support of the people, and abandoned its traditional roots, which insidiously eroded its stability from within. Nothing less than a complete restructuring of society will satisfy them."

For the duration of the Regency, it shall be the sole legal party in the country, and the Regency will manage all day to day affairs of the state.\n\nAlready, underground Republicans and Socialists have denounced this regime as a dictatorship - not that they were ever going to accept the fall of the Republic."

 serbia.67.d1:0 "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, a prominent publication was released in their unofficial newspaper, "Buđenje" ("Awakening") - it is an anti-semitic, anti-muslim and an esoteric nationalist creed, proclaiming the Dictatorship of November 6th to be a 'national revolution' which will 'purify Serbia and restore its pride'. The publication and the newspaper in general call for an authoritarian corporatist system, present the Iron Guard regime in Romania as an example, and spew vehement hatred towards syndicalism, which they describe as completely against Serbian national interest."
 serbia.67.d2:0 "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, the White Eagles paramilitary organisation has held a mass rally on the streets of Belgrade, proclaiming their support to the restored Serbian monarchy and calling for the 'national revival' of the Serbian nation. This rally did not pass without controversy, however. The marchers chanted anti-semitic slogans, called for the expulsion of minorities in Kosovo and Macedonia in order for those lands to be integrated into the Serbian state, and intimidated the general public. Even the military had to get involved to maintain the peace in the city before any riots broke out."
 serbia.67.d3:0 "The radical monarchist faction within the Radical Peasants' Democracy continues to grow, subsuming more of the party and of the greater monarchist movement. Today, large masses of White Eagles, ZBORniks and other radical monarchist organisations organised a mass impromptu volunteer labour action in the Serbian countryside. Hundreds of nationalist youth were sent to villages and individual farms to help the local farming communities without payment. Though the effects of the action were meagre, it was heavily propagandised in nationalist newspapers, describing it as a living example of the Zadruga ideal - communalism and a return to the agrarian nature of the Serbian people."
 serbia.67.d4:0 "The White Hand, forever loyal supporters of the House of Karađorđević, continue to consolidate their hold over the Radical Peasants' Democracy and the greater monarchist movement. Today, a large military parade was held on the streets of Belgrade, the rejuvenated Serbian Army has chosen to showcase both its military might and its loyalty to the monarchy. Famous Serbian military marches were rehearsed and the parade was finished with a dramatic singing of the anthem of the Yugoslavian movement, "Hej, Sloveni!". The parade did not go without controversy, however, as underground resistance newspapers claim that the event was held to distract from crackdowns on socialist and republican dissenters across the country."
 serbia.67.d5:0 "The White Hand, forever loyal supporters of the House of Karađorđević, continue to consolidate their hold over the Radical Peasants' Democracy and the greater monarchist movement. Today, the military has chosen to give hell to known underground resistance - several republican and socialist leaders, as well as defectors from the army who opposed the coup of 1936 were rooted from their hiding holes. During the Republican interregnum, the Monarchists were violently repressed, and only the sycophants and the harmless radicals were allowed to operate, aiming to discredit the movement. Now that they were in power, they could take all the revenge they wanted."
 serbia.67.d6:0 "The White Hand, forever loyal supporters of the House of Karađorđević, continue to consolidate their hold over the Radical Peasants' Democracy and the greater monarchist movement. Today, General Petar Živković and his clique have successfully made several important contracts with the Serbian upper class - the businesses who believed themselves to be threatened by radical Republican and Socialist rhetoric, and former leaders of the NRS who chose to change sides during the Coup of 1936. The ties between the Radicals and the White Hand go far, and while they have been severed somewhat in the past, Živković has diligently worked to restore them ever since the declaration of the November 6th Dictatorship."

It is highly expected that either the White Hand or the radical monarchist caucus will gain control of the affairs of the state and maintain this control after the King's eighteenth birthday. For those who remember his father's Royal Dictatorship unfavourably, such a future is hard to swallow - is it not a mistake to blindly cling onto this despotic past, when it might have been the reason why the Kingdom fell in the first place?\n\nFortunately for those who were democratically aligned, King Petar II did not grow up to be an incompetent figurehead swayed easily by his Regent's ambitions. Already, he has shown a propensity for independent action opposing the wishes of his officials directly, with a political vision behind it. With this in mind, he has been approached by a slowly developing conspiracy in the shadows of the Regency, commanded by General Dušan Simović, a leading member of the Konspiracija before the October coup.\n\nIn a series of secret talks, General Simović has offered the removal of the Regency and the bestowal of all of the royal powers to him before maturity. With Živković, Ljotić and other hardliners sidelined, a provisional government will be able to spearhead the creation of a constitutional monarchy, just like the one he left in Canada years ago."

Alongside loyal elements of the army, they seized control of communications in Belgrade and cut telegraph lines in preparation for the main event. King Petar II himself had to take initiative in the next part, a decision made despite protest by numerous conspirators due to the monarch's age and thus assumed unreliability. Nevertheless, the plot proceeded.\n\nOn the day of the coup, the King held a feast where all the leading personalities of the Regency, including the Regent, Petar Živković, and the informal leader of the radical faction of the Radical Peasants' Democracy, Dimitrije Ljotić, were required to attend. Rising up from his seat before the attendees, Petar II declared himself of age and the assumption of his full royal powers - his first act as an absolute monarch is to call for the arrest of everyone in the room. Before anyone could protest, the conspiracy activated, and armed officers stormed the hall.\n\nThe King later made a speech on the radio confirming this transfer of power to the celebration of Belgrade's citizens. Demonstrations in support of Petar II and Dušan Simović continued for several days after."

They are former Republicans and moderate Radicals who reformed themselves as a constitutional monarchist party, endorsing the restoration of full democracy and the amendment of the Constitution of 1903 to fit the needs of the present day.\n\nGeneral Dušan Simović, however, is not as eager to take such a sudden lunge to the left. Picturing himself as a mentor to the young monarch, he offered a government formed by the People's Radical Party instead - this veteran political machine has survived much political upheaval over the years and a brief Regency Dictatorship certainly could not kill them either. Their politicians promise a return to the golden years of Petar II's grandfather and his namesake, and their conservative ideals will certainly make a transition from the dictatorial Regency more palatable for the monarchists who supported the coup."

The Regency may have resigned, but the influence of its years in power lingers, and the faction of the Radical Peasants' Democracy which gained control of the party in the preceding years will almost certainly form the new government.

The Serbian Cultural Club has been drafting ideas of a "Greater Serbia" instead, one which should be formed after the collapse of the Austrian empire and include all territories inhabited by Serbs, or territories said to be inhabited by Serbs, and perhaps a little bit more...\n\nThankfully, within the past decade, the Serbian Army has gained complete control of the government, eliminating the last barrier between this goal and reality. Within a week after the proclamation of Yugoslavia, a silent coup seized control of the state, overthrew the democratically elected government and reverted the proclamation. Milan Nedić, the elder of the powerful Nedić, has come to power as the provisional president of a greater Serbia.\n\nThough they were officially opposed to the coup and fled to the underground, both the Republicans and the Radicals saw numerous members either support or tolerate the putsch. This severely shook the reputation of both of the parties, and as the coup advances from Belgrade to consolidate the rest of the country, their leaders such as Dragomir Vasić and Milan Stojadinović find themselves unable to organize a serious response."

The Serbian Army reports that control has been lost over much of former Illyria, and more importantly, the Prečani communities in Croatia and Bosnia are being threatened.

Former Pelagićevci guerrillas led by Vukašin Marković rose up one after another and they were followed by Montenegrin, Macedonian and Albanian separatists, allowing this movement to consolidate a semi-strong grip over the south of the country.\n\nIn Cetinje, it declared the formation of the Anti-Reactionary Assembly for the Liberation of Serbia, and have effectively transformed into a Third Internationale-aligned revolutionary organisation."

Few view this agreement naively - the Bulgarian political consensus, no matter if it leans left or right, understands that the signatories of the treaty will use it as a weapon against Bulgaria.\n\nSome were more alarmist than others. The largest daily newspaper in Sofia, "Utro", printed in large bold letters: "WAR IS COMING! SERBS MOBILISE TO SEIZE MACEDONIA!". The alarm came in reference to one of the proclaimed goals of the Congress of Belgrade, which is to "call for a new order in the Balkans", which Bulgarian conservatives could only interpret as a call to topple Greater Bulgaria. The same newspaper print also included an article by Nikola Zhekov, general in the Bulgarian Army, who asserted that Bulgaria is completely unprepared to wage a war and the only solution is to immediately plead for mediation from Germany and Austria-Hungary. To work with the Germans, who exploited us so brutally during the Weltkrieg, was considered inconceivable not too long ago, and it might still be, but as of today, anything goes...\n\nSerbian, Turkish and Greek representatives in the National Assembly stood in support of the Pact - the Romanian delegation from constituencies in Dobrudja was more reserved, however.

This changed today, as in a bloody coup, the secret royalist military society White Hand has overthrown the recently elected government of Serbia and declared the restoration of the Kingdom in a half-empty Skupština. The heir of the Serbian throne and the son of Aleksandar II Karađorđević, Prince Petar, is expected to arrive to Belgrade in a couple of days.\n\nThe House of Karađorđević seized power in Serbia after the slaughter of Aleksandar I and the entire Obrenović dynasty by the Black Hand, and they held nothing but disdain for the Bulgarian peoples of Macedonia. Both Petar II and Aleksandar II endorsed Serbianisation campaigns in the region after seizing it in the Balkan Wars, humiliating the local population by forcing them to declare themselves as Serbs, and often resorting to terror. Alas, they were not overthrown during the Weltkrieg and stayed in power, though in a mere rump state - and it appears even a Republican revolution cannot keep them down for too long.\n\nThe news from Belgrade have galvanised the Bulgarian population and further sharpened conflict in the Niš region, all while dealing a blow to the republican cause in Sofia. The officer corps is resolute and takes these news with pride, however - if history has made a mistake and restored Aleksandar's child on the throne, then it shall be up to Bulgarian shoulders to rectify it."

 serflavor.3.d:0 "The right wing of the Serbian political spectrum, beyond the People's Radical Party and the Agrarians, is mainly composed of monarchists, and among them two movements are the most notable. The State Party of Serbian Democrats was the sole legal party of Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship and lingers on as a small moderate monarchist party, concentrated in a few constituencies where they are the strongest, and as they were too insignificant to threaten the republican order, they were allowed to remain legal after the Revolution. The second is a party formed after the Revolution for a new generation of monarchists, named Buđenje ("Awakening"), and its leader, Dimitrije Ljotić, has been slowly making a name for himself.\n\nSpeaking before the Skupština, Ljotić addressed what he perceives the key issues of the Serbian republic - the death of God in a nation overtaken by lust and contempt, and the daily, endless crushing of souls by the "sledgehammer of capitalism" which the past governments have enabled with their policies. The politician's esoteric way of speaking convinced few and made him few allies in the legislature, but it was characteristic of the so-called "Mita Bogomoljac" ("Devotionalist Mita"). Even back when he was an official in King Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship and a deputy from Smederevo, Ljotić was unnerving to his peers. He declared his service to the Karađorđević to be divine providence, that the Serbian people to have a God-bestowed mission in the world, and his Orthodox faith was beyond even the fanatical.\n\nLeading a far-right extremist, nationalist royalist party, Ljotić is a minnow on the political stage and so has been allowed to remain for now - but who knows where he might end up if the circumstances change?.."

Not wishing to take the risk, the two men hastened their pace, hoping to either come across civilians to use as cover or a phone booth to call the police, but neither came. Instead, the mysterious assailants opened fire, seriously wounding Knežević and killing his peer - wounded, the officer was dragged out of sight and so was the corpse besides him.\n\nIt took the police two days to be informed about the officer's disappearance, and a search across Belgrade was immediately initiated - Knežević was found, but by then, it was already too late, as he was long since dead. Police officers found his corpse in the outskirts of the city, and it was left with a message:\n\n"Thus unto all enemies of God, the King, and the White Hand!""

A few children playing football around the block explained that some strange looking men hanged them there not too long ago.\n\nOnly the dimmest failed to realize who was behind these murders. Not only was Major Živan Knežević a respected member of the Serbian Cultural Club and the secret organisation behind it, but he was also the brother of Radoje Knežević, a commander in the Serbian Air Force, a leading member of the Republican Party and the Konspiracija. While the military is understandably silent about the events, and Knežević merely expressed his solemn grief at his brother's death, it's almost certain that these assassinations were made as an act of righteous revenge. \n\nAnd, again, much like everyone expected, the police closed the case a few days later, stating that 'the investigation will pause for the time being as no possible suspect has been found'."

 serflavor.6.d:0 "In the first two decades of the twentieth century, three Balkan Wars shook the region - two were local affairs, fought only between the Balkan states themselves, whereas the third is more commonly known as the Balkan front of the Weltkrieg. For almost two decades after its conclusion, worldwide observers expected it to be the last, too. After all, the Weltkrieg left Bulgaria a hegemon in the Balkans and its three competitors shattered, held down by oppressive peace treaties for having chosen the wrong side, and divorced from much of their core lands. Surely, in a Europe redrawn according to Germany's whim, there is no room for revanchist ambitions in the Balkans.\n\nIt is clear today, as thousands of men across the region take up arms, that those predictions were wrong. Was it the weakness of so-called "Greater Bulgaria" which was at fault? Or does the blame fall to Austria and Germany for having grown complacent towards the Balkans and not stopped the rearmament of the Balkan states? By now, the answer does not matter - only bloodshed will ensue.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that the Fourth Balkan War will escalate into a worldwide conflict, as none of the great powers treat it as a proxy war against one another just yet, there are still potential participants in the war lying in wait - and nobody knows what the result of it will be. Can Bulgaria defend its fragile hegemony over the Balkan region and make it stand the test of time? Or will the Belgrade Pact achieve the "new order in the Balkans" which it calls for?"

 serflavor.7.d:0 "The loss in the Weltkrieg marked a fundamental change in Serbian society, and its culture was no exception. An absolute majority of Serbian males died in the war, and almost a quarter of its total population, while the few who remained had to return to burned homes, looted towns, abandoned farms and broken dreams. To cope, many turned to art to express their frustration and sorrow - and yet, the onset of Aleksandar II's Royal Dictatorship stymied the development of Serbian art and culture under heavy censorship. The Republican Revolution of 1925 let this pent up energy loose, and the following decade has left its mark in Serbian culture as a period of avant-garde art, literature, and cultural critique. Few movements were more exemplary of this period than Zenitism, named after the arts magazine "Zenit".\n\nFounded by Ljubomir Micić, Ivan Gol and Boško Tokin, it publishes articles on modern society, art reviews, and cultural publications. While contributors to the magazine are numerous, a common strand of anti-war, anti-nationalist and anti-capitalist thought runs through it - and, above them all, modern, "western" society. What was the reason why Serbia suffered so much, Micić and his associates ponder in the pages of Zenit? It is because Serbia, having chosen to abandon its unique Balkan spirit and communal, peaceful culture, sold its soul to a greater European civilisation and the cold, heartless machine of modern capitalism. That machine gave the modern tools of war to Serbia with which she killed itself. Some describe Zenitism as anarcho-primitivist, pointing out their scathing critique of modern technology and its lifeless lifestyle, while others see it as taking their thought too literally.\n\nAs 1936 turns, Zenit and the Serbian avant-garde continue their course, even though, as years pass and memory of Weltkrieg devastation grows duller, they become seen as unpatriotic rather than visionary."

For many, this was a beauty to behold, but the superstitious immediately took this as a sign from the God above. Clearly, with such a show, he was trying to tell the people something - though, was it a warning, a favour or a threat.\n\nThe most striking interpretation came from a Serbian preacher in the Morava countryside, who interpreted this as a sign of the first thing. It was a warning, and no ordinary warning, to the people of Europe - in his town and surrounding villages, he proclaimed that God is aware of an impending apocalypse, and one not driven by the four horsemen, but rather by the peoples of Europe themselves. In less than ten years, the rivers of the continent will run red with blood much like the sky ran red that night, a ferocious eagle, its wingspan large enough to cover Europe, will fight a storm of ice and snow from the east, and declare itself a defender of the world from a pure evil... yet its heart is just as dark as the evil it claims to fight.\n\nA fascinating tale.

 serflavor.9.d:0 "One of the most renown political philosophers and legal professors in the republic of Serbia, Slobodan Jovanović, has published a revision to one of his first works, "Political and Legal Discussions" ("Političke i pravne rasprave"), and its most important change was the addition of a new preface and introduction. In this preface, Jovanović made a leap forward and described the events of 1925-1926 not as "the Republican Revolution", but as "the second Serbian Revolution".\n\nThe first Serbian revolution referred to by Jovanović was the famous three-decades-long Serbian Revolution, led by Karađorđe Petrović and numerous other heroes of Serbian history, which happened concurrently with the Greek War of Independence and culminated in the recognition of the vassal Principality of Serbia. It is generally seen as the beginning of modern Serbian history and the first step in its long journey to independence. Jovanović explains his decision to name it "First" later in the text - the "Second" Serbian Revolution, of the post-Weltkrieg period, should be understood not as an independent event, but as the culmination of the ideals of Karađorđe and the first Serbian revolutionaries.\n\nFrom this initial statement, there are numerous conclusions to be made. The Serbian people live a history marked by redemptive struggle in the name of freedom and liberty, be it for their freedom from foreign oppressors, or their freedom from unjust government. The democracy which they enjoy should not be understood as a Western import, but rather as a development of unique Serbian culture and identity - and vice versa, democracy should be considered a core element of Serbian identity."

 serflavor.10.d:0 "The concept of the "Dinaric Race", created by Western racial scientists in the late 19th century as a way to classify the peoples of southeastern Europe, had been hijacked by pan-Slavic nationalists since the earliest days. As the most radical current in the Yugoslavism ideology, it describes Serbs, Croats, Slovenes, Bosniaks and Macedonians as a part of a single "race", and that the differences between them arose of historical separation rather than any inherent differences.\n\nA notable early supporter of ideas which would later form Dinarism was Jovan Cvijić, Serbian geographer and geologist who used the environmental conditions of the Balkans to describe the formation of this joint South Slavic identity. Across the border from Serbia, these ideas are most prominently developed by the Croat philosopher Vladimir Dvorniković, who declares in his writings that the South Slavs need to unite for mutual interests, much like Germans and Italians in the 19th century. His views include eugenics and cultural blending to build this strong Yugoslav "race", and a comprehensive description of unitarist Yugoslavian philosophy. Dimitrije Ljotić and his political party are the closest to propagating the Dinarist line in Serbian politics."

It read:\n\n"To His Majesty, Petar Karađorđević,\n\nHearing the news about your return, I could not be more overjoyed.

However, I also understand that a difficult task has been placed upon your shoulders, and it will only grow greater as time passes - I sincerely hope that you will manage to bear it, and become the King which the Serbian people need. You are still young and you never saw your homeland in your life - my peers say that will make you weak, but it makes me hopeful instead. Is there a better way for the Serbs to join the brotherhood of Western nations than through a King who grew up in the West, and understands the crux of their success?\n\nAs you mature, learn, and take up your royal duties, I wish for you to remember one thing.

For a country with its geopolitical position, several choices are available, each one with their ups and downs. The Entente is often mentioned among these discussions - and for some, they may appear to be a natural choice. After all, it was the British and French empires that the Serbs fought side by side with during the Weltkrieg, and their third-power status means that Serbia would be able to more easily stay away of the greatest wars of Europe while not being completely vulnerable.\n\nThese ideas are being squashed by the President, however. Though he has seldom hidden his hatred for the British Empire before, Dragomir Vasić has now made it even more clear to his cabinet and his peers in the Republican-led coalition. Speaking to Nikola Milovanović, the President did not mince his words:\n\n"There shall be no alliance between Serbia and the British Empire. Not only that, but in a liberated Yugoslavia, I will do everything in my power to establish a department which will study and nurture hatred of the British! I have already told this to Grol, but if I could, I would wage all the little nations in the world to a war against them."\n\nEven in their dismantled, exiled state in Canada, the British monarchy symbolised the worst aspects of colonialism and exploitation to Vasić, and he was not going to let it slide."

The two term limit has finally caught up to him, however, and upon the conclusion of this year's election, the outgoing President has made his way before the newly elected Skupština to give one last speech to the parliamentarians.\n\nThe President's speech could be divided into two parts. In the first, he congratulated his fellow Serbs for their dedication to the values of the Republic, and the sacrifices they have made in war and peace alike. It was a difficult task to lead Serbia when he has personally experienced the horrors of war and knew what he would resign his fellow Serbs to. After this recognition came a warning, however. The Balkans and all of Europe remain infested with tyrants. Absolutists, Syndicalists and extreme nationalists continue to oppress their own people and will surely seek to put out the light of liberty in Serbia in the years that follow. To counter that, Vasić gave Serbia his advice - to stand their guard no matter how overwhelming the odds may be, and find a coalition of like-minded nations with whom they may protect democracy together. As the first Serbian Revolution, led by Karađorđe, has proven, the Serbian people value their freedom above all else and Vasić expressed hope that they will continue to do so for centuries to come.\n\nIt is believed that after leaving office, the President will return to literary and educational work - he was a prolific writer before, and the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade has already expressed interest in giving him a position in their professor ranks."

There, he was briefed on the achievements made by the Royalists ever since the beginning of the Regime of November 6th - the destruction of republicanism and a restoration of Serbian national pride cited immediately.\n\nPavle did not seem to pay much attention to the description of the political situation, and soon requested to speak to his nephew in private. The generally careless and inattentive Prince turned serious for a second and explained his concerns - could Petar not see that Živković, Ljotić and their men were merely trying to restore what his father had once built? A dictatorial regime, with a King at the top, which will merely turn the populace more furious and force them to turn to the same violent means as retaliation. It was this failure to understand the people which led to Petar's father's death.\n\nNow, Pavle asserted that he didn't have a perfect solution - in fact, the Prince stated that if he somehow became the Regent himself, he would do a far, far worse job than Živković - however, he instead raised a question to Petar: what will he do when he assumes full powers?

The assassination of Aleksandar II had thus shaken the Romanian royal family as well, especially once his wife and Carol's sister fled to her homeland.\n\nThe young King's motorcade in Bucharest was greeted by jubilant crowds. Under orders, his vehicle stopped by an assembly of Serbian monarchists exiled in Romania ever since the Republican Era - many of whom had formed close ties with the Iron Guard during the following years, seeing Codreanu's salvationist ideology as the best way to restore Serbia's strength, and so hailed their monarch with a Legionary salute. After official diplomatic ceremonies, Petar was invited to the Royal Palace, where he shook hands with "Uncle Carol" and met his cousin, Crown Prince Mihai. The two members of the next generation of Balkan royalty quickly found common ground and left a positive impression on each other, to the point where Petar even offered Mihai to visit Serbia next time."

Even before the Weltkrieg, Lapčević earned fame as a vehement opponent of war and Serbian militarism, and today he spoke with the same purpose behind him.\n\nIn his speech, the politician vividly detailed the loss which the Serbian nation suffered the last time when they instigated a foolish war - an entire generation dead or wounded, and the few who remain have been forced to pick up the pieces. If they had sworn in 1918 to never suffer such travesty again, then it seems that their leaders have completely forgotten these losses. Not only that, Lapčević states, but the President and his government have lied to the entire nation about their motives, and to the world as well. They claim to fight for the liberation of the Serbs, but in fact, they are controlled by an ultranationalist, Codreanite clique in the military, which will subvert democracy if it means sending thousands of Serbs to the meatgrinder in Macedonia.\n\nThe speech and its content, if it spreads across the public, is bound to galvanize the population and raise doubt so close to the war against Bulgaria.

Alongside with the Belgrade Gendarmerie and local volunteers, they were the first line of defence against the advancing enemy forces and marched to battle with the grim knowledge that they will fall one by one for Belgrade and the Fatherland. In a final act of defiance, Major Gavrilović gave a rousing speech where he announced to his men that their regiment has been erased from the records of the Army, hence there is little for them to do except go forward to glory, for King and Country.\n\nThe valiant defence of the Serbian defenders did not prove to be enough and the White City fell, but under the orders of Field Marshal August von Mackensen, a monument was erected in Austrian-occupied Belgrade, which still says "Here Rest Serbian Heroes" and which is the centre of the procession today. Soldiers of the army salute the humble monument and widows of the defenders of Belgrade place flowers before it.\n\nSome would say that their sacrifice was in vain, as Serbia was ultimately subjugated and had to spend almost two decades languishing under Austrian and Bulgarian domination. Others are more apologetic - after all, Serbia has managed to rise from those ashes since, and does that not make up for it?"

While this uprising is far from the first in the territory Bulgaria annexed from Serbia during the Weltkrieg, it has surpassed others in size and ferocity. Over two thousand armed insurgents were reported occupying several towns by the Bulgarian military.\n\nThe response of the Bulgarian Army was characteristically brutal. Regiments of the Ohrana, the successors to the chetas of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation organised into self-defence groups, were the first to respond, using acts of terror and intimidation to quell resistance in the region, often with significant civilian casualties. Once the Bulgarian Army joined the response efforts, the Chetniks were driven to the mountains, the town of Prokuplje was burned down after a prolonged firefight, and reprisals against the population began.\n\nThe members of the Belgrade Pact condemned the atrocities almost immediately - especially Serbia, which declared that it will defend the interests and safety of its Serbian inhabitants by any means necessary. Bulgarian officials rebutted the claims, and accused the government in Belgrade of sponsoring the resistance in turn. Whether it was true or not, Serbia now had a justification to attack - and as both countries mass units on their border, it seems they are ready to use it."

So little time has passed since the time when Serbia was a minnow in the Balkans, much less the world - now, it reigns over the City of the World's Desire.\n\nFor the Serbian people, Constantinople is not merely a city, it is a symbol. It was supposed to be the crown jewel of Stefan Dušan, the first Tsar of the Serbs, who expanded the medieval Serbian principality to its largest extent, with the dream of crafting a new Roman Empire with the Serbs at its head. Alas, as he mounted a crusade against the Turks, he died prematurely, leading to the collapse of his Empire and the beginning of the end for the Balkans.\n\nFrom there, everyone knows how history went. Though Serbs and the other Slavs fought bravely, resisted, bit back in the fields of Kosovo and elsewhere, they were subjugated one after another, and centuries of despised Turkish yoke followed. Today, the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia have achieved what Tsar Dušan could not, and the Ottoman Empire has been forced to its knees.\n\nAs a symbolic act, King Petar II has been invited to attend the occupation of Constantinople for a brief ceremony - where, inside the Hagia Sophia, he was crowned in the style of the first Tsar as the historical sources tell us, and granted the title of "Tsar of the Serbs". It may have little weight now, in a world where the Roman Empire has long since fallen and imperial dreams no longer matter, but it shall forever act as a sign that the Serbs will never be subjugated again."

The Revolution of 1925 interrupted the construction works and left them unfinished, however, and the Republican regime ceased the construction. The Thatched House, where King Aleksandar II used to reside and oversee the construction, was returned to the public and parts of the unfinished Palace were turned into a museum.\n\nToday, the Regency considers continuing the construction, although a decade of neglect will make it costly, which got moderates from the former Radical Party to offer another solution. During the Republican period. the traitors built a palace for their Presidents in the heart of Belgrade, a simple and functionalistic building which pales in comparison to European royal palaces, but possibly good enough for the Royal Family regardless. In addition, such a move would show the Republicans that a fall of the monarchy is now a distant dream."

This decree ordered the abolition of serfdom and sharecropping in Kosovo, the expropriation of estates formerly held by Albanian and Turkish landowners, and the settlement of Serbian war veterans in these vacant holdings. This marked a period of ethnic settlement in Kosovo, expulsion of thousands of Albanians, and ensuing conflict.\n\nTo the Serbs, Kosovo holds sentimental value as the location of the legendary Battle of Kosovo in the 14th century, and the official line of the Serbian government was that the Albanians were recent settlers, brought by the Ottoman Turks, and thus integration of Kosovo into Serbia was seen as a righting of a historical wrong. Finally, thousands of war veterans were on the streets of Serbia, they had been promised land during the Weltkrieg, and Aleksandar's Royal Dictatorship was anxious to satisfy their demands to avoid rebellion. The colonisation of Kosovo was deemed to be a failure, however. Kosovo remained staunchly Albanian and the population was left inflamed, and many of the colonists returned home or emigrated to the West after failing to make a living.\n\nThe colonisation was disrupted by the Republican Revolution, although some settlement continued for a few years before the Decree was finally abolished in 1931. Still, the scars of its legacy are as clear as day in Kosovo, and it will take a long time for the region to heal."

A vehement nationalist with authoritarian tendencies, he saw the Revolution as a "national rebirth" from a dynasty that failed the Serbs, and the liberal democracy established afterwards did not satisfy his dreams.\n\nIn "Who Will Be the Serbian Savinkov?", Jonić seeks to draw the parallel between the Russian Republic before Savinkov and Serbia, both Slavic states "of similar spiritual composition" which were allured by the illusions of liberal democracy after defeat in the war. Russia was hijacked by a dictator following a new ideological creed, which Jonić describes as "national revolutionary" - clearly radical and one against the status quo, but an idea which seeks to bring the country back towards where it truly needs to focus, that is, revanchism.\n\nThe question in the treatise's title is rhetorical, Jonić does not provide an answer - however, he writes that he will not only expect the Serbian Revolution to be hijacked, but will also welcome this "end of the opiate of Serbian people"."

 yugoslavia.5.d:0 "Composed from numerous factions united across Yugoslavia, the Republican-Democrats understandably have many strong political figures among them who wish to lead the party in the following years - so, to ease the tensions and form a united party line, leadership elections for the RDS are being held. The party chapters across the country are expected to send delegates to Kraljevo, where the party national conference is being held and where the new leader of the Republican-Democrats will be decided.\n\nMilan Grol is the leading contender - Dragomir Vasić's Prime Minister and a leading politician in the former Serbian Republican Party in his own right, he is expected to lead the party in a moderate, federalist direction. Srđan Budisavljević, a Prečani Serb and one of the leaders of the Croat-Serb Coalition in Illyria, challenges his candidacy, however. For long, the Prečani have been the strongest advocates of integral Yugoslavism promoting a more aggressive unification of the South Slavs and the centralisation of Yugoslavia - and should Budisavljević take over the party and win the next elections, he will surely seek to implement this goal. Finally, some delegates turn to Albert Kramer, a Slovene politician who is seen as an acceptable compromise for many factions in the party.\n\nThe ballots are counted and the next leader of the Republican-Democrats is..."

It sympathises with National Populism and operates a paramilitary wing, the Action Groups, which unite hundreds of war veterans and young radicals with the goal of keeping Yugoslavia alive and destroying any separatists, via any means necessary. Already, they have gained a penchant for violence and terror - raiding and bombing separatist newspaper offices, violently beating up socialists and Croatian nationalists on the streets, so on and so forth.\n\nThe formation of the ORJUNA has prompted Croatian nationalists to organise as well, spiking tensions across the Habsburg half of Yugoslavia."

Though they did not adopt syndicalism, they established a free, liberal and socially-oriented society, which the Internationale quickly made ties with. As Serbia's goals aligned with ours, the Internationale supported it with arms and technical expertise - and it seems that our support has been helpful, as the Serbian republic has established a Yugoslavian federation after wars against Bulgaria and Austria.\n\nNow, the Yugoslavs reach out to us, asking to integrate into the Internationale's system in Europe. Not as a member of the alliance, but rather as an aligned, neutral state, which will maintain close friendly ties with our regime and receive trade advantages. Yugoslavia is not socialist by any means, but they are economically and socially progressive, so perhaps there's no harm in the agreement?"

 yugoslavia.10.d:0 "The Croatian Party of Rights had initially dissolved after the foundation of Yugoslavia, but has gathered once again, this time with the stated purpose of defending the "Croatian state right". The new Belgrade order has deeply affected the Croatian nationalist party. It has allied itself with the Croatian Peasants' Party in order to form the Croatian National Representation, a joint political force, but over time it has increasingly been overtaken by radicalism.\n\nNew cadres in the party, recruited throughout the period, show the tendency for increasingly radical rhetoric - discreetly or even openly endorsing a terrorist campaign against the Yugoslav state in order to evict the Serbs and establish an Independent State of Croatia. This Croatian state should encompass the maximum extent of Croatian claims, including Bosnia and Syrmia, and purified of ethnic minorities.\n\nSuch rhetoric continues spreading among our Croatian population, raising tensions further."

 yugoslavia.11.t:0 "The Vukovar Congress"
 yugoslavia.11.d:0 "The Socialist Workers' Party was unique in that it kept contacts with its peers across the border long before the formation of Yugoslavia. The SRP and its counterpart in Illyria with the same name cooperated on joint policy and future plans, and now that the South Slavs have been reunited, it is only natural that a congress will be held in Vukovar to unite all of the socialist factions into a single, united fist. Even the Socialists have been invited, even though they once broke from the orthodox SRP after the Centrumaši split.\n\nStill, it is not guaranteed that the party will unify. Two decades of separation have left their impact - the ideological line of the Illyrian and Serbian socialists has diverged, the former more in line with Western syndicalism and the latter seeking to tread a uniquely South Slavic path."

The Bulgarian Army, its highest command as well as the rank and file will be integrated into the Yugoslav Army, and additional representatives to the National Assembly will be elected to represent the new Bulgarian constituents. The integration of such a large country has not gone without issues, of course, and it is expected that Bulgaria will severely tip the already delicate balance inside Yugoslavia, but the future appears bright for the federation of the South Slavs."

 yugoslavia.15.t:0 "Birth of the Croatian Revolutionary Organisation"
 yugoslavia.15.d:0 "The radicalisation of the right-wing of the Croatian Party of Rights ever since the formation of Yugoslavia, and the inability of the government in Belgrade to stabilise the state in time, has finally concluded in the birth of something worrying. No longer appeased by any sort of reconciliation talks or federalist promises, these radicals have organised around the underground magazine "Insurgent" ("Ustaša"), in which they proclaimed their break with any form of Yugoslavia - as the very first publication of the magazine states, "only the dagger, revolver, rifle and bomb will herald the resurrection of the Independent State of Croatia". This publication also announced the formation of the Croatian Revolutionary Organisation, which has taken the mantle of this proclamation.\n\nThe name of the magazine was swiftly adopted by the organisation as a shorthand. It unites the radical new generation of Croatian politicians, former soldiers and officers in the Austro-Hungarian army who refused to integrate into the Yugoslav armed forces, and those who suffered in the Austro-Hungarian-Belgrade Pact war. Some suspect that they may even be aided by remnants of the IMRO, the Croatian insurgents trained in exile in the art of assassination and sabotage. Already, several bombings of loyalist newspaper offices and shootings in Croatian streets have been attributed to the organisation, and peace in Croatia appears to be increasingly fragile."

Their offices have been bombed and one of their editors was assaulted on the street, beaten to the inch of their life for speaking out against the integrity of the state. The news shook his ethnic community, and while calls for separatism have died down somewhat, the stability of Yugoslavia takes another blow."
 yugoslavia.16.d2:0 "Centuries of life in separate empires has left Yugoslavia in deep wealth disparity. It is no secret that the northern provinces - Croatia and Slovenia specifically - are far more developed and prosperous than the backwards South. This reality has sparked an angry argument between Croatian and Serbian deputies in the National Assembly - the Serbs call for greater redistribution of wealth from the North, levying taxes on Croatian and Slovene businesses to fund development in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, while the Croats despise the prospect, their deputies declaring that they have no obligation to carry the economy of the entire union on their shoulders. The government's ministers are requested to intervene and make a decision on the debate."
 yugoslavia.16.d3:0 "Though Serbo-Croatian is enforced as the official language of Yugoslavia, trying to enforce it has been met with issues. Not only are there regions where literacy remains minimal - the mountains of Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro, for example - but the difference in script is a more difficult hurdle to pass than anticipated. Bureaucrats and officials proficient in Latin and Cyrillic are rare, the Austro-Hungarian policy of Latinisation during the First Weltkrieg has left many Serbs sceptical towards Latin alphabet usage, while many Croats and Slovenes arrogantly refuse to accept Cyrillic as an equal to their Western script. Something has to be done about the disparity, and swiftly."
 yugoslavia.16.d4:0 "A circle of philosophers associated with Integral Yugoslavist thought have published a proclamation calling for the centralisation of the state and the erasure of what they describe as "tribes of one Yugoslav nation" through determined re-education. Others supporters of Integralism have endorsed the publication, all while criticising Croatian and Slovene separatists. Some of them even appealed to a mystical "Dinaric race", a racial group encompassing the Yugoslavs superior to other European races, and the need to unify all South Slavs under this racial structure. Though these theories have gained limited traction across the country, they endorse our government and so can be put to good use."
 yugoslavia.16.d5:0 "Much like in the rest of the Islamic world, Sufi lodges are prolific among the Balkan Muslims, disseminating their spiritual teachings in informal gatherings, learning circles, and other venues, be it private and public. Though never banned or discouraged by the Austro-Hungarian government, they were supervised and put under the jurisdiction of mainstream religious clerics, a practice which has continued under Yugoslav administration. After the conquest of Bosnia, the government in Belgrade reestablished the Islamic Religious Community (Islamska Vjerska Zajednica – IVZ), a centralised institution controlled by an appointed chief cleric and a four-member council, with jurisdiction over Muslim religious affairs.\n\nMainstream Muslim clerics have no love for the alternate interpretations of Islam that the Sufi offer, however, and so have begun using this institution to enforce Sharia law for the entire Muslim community in Yugoslavia. An intra-religious conflict is brewing in Bosnia, and the government is forced to take a side."
 yugoslavia.16.d6:0 "Alongside millions of their fellow Slavs, Yugoslavia also inherited over half a million Germans from the former lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Concentrated in Slovenia, Croatia and especially Vojvodina, where they are one of the largest ethnic groups in a highly diverse region, they are the descendants of immigrants and colonists who arrived over centuries of Habsburg rule. Now fallen under rule from Belgrade, these Germans lost their privileges and status, and are more often than not treated as a potential fifth column. Estates of German landowners were seized and distributed, the Swabian German Kulturbund faces legal issues ever since inception, as government officials see an organised German minority as a threat to the state.\n\nFrustrated by this discrimination, a collection of German intellectuals have made a petition demanding change.

From here on out, a vast popular front shall be built from Serbian and Illyrian socialists, the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia, which shall continue the role of the Serbian SRP as the only legal party and guiding force of the socialist state.\n\nNot everyone has agreed with this merger, however. Citing the dedication of Serbian socialists towards a purported "Serbian" socialism, French-inspired socialists and trade unionists in Croatia have broken to form a left-wing opposition to the ruling party, the Syndicalist Party. Immediately, as an example of "leftist deviation", these Syndicalists have been purged from political posts and workplaces and thus driven underground."
 yugoslavia.17.d3:0 "The Congress was attended by socialists of all ideological alignment across Yugoslavia - and several weeks of debate, discussion and conflict have ended in complete failure. Both the Serbian and the Illyrian side of the Congress continuously criticised the leadership of the SRP for their inability to take advantage of their victory in the Serbian elections of 1936, a moment which should have been a final victory for the party and yet resulted in compromise and failure.\n\nIn the end, the socialist movements of Yugoslavia dissolved, the social democrats leaving the congress to continue their separate work as the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, and Croatian socialists concentrating around the Syndicalist Party as the main challenge to the Serbian SRP in the revolutionary socialist niche."
 yugoslavia.17.d4:0 "The Congress was attended by socialists of all ideological alignment across Yugoslavia - and several weeks of debate, discussion and conflict have finally concluded in partial agreement. The moderate Socialists left the Congress very quickly, disappointed by its revolutionary direction, and continued their work as the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia, while the rest of the Congress drafted a comprehensive unification of the entire radical socialist left into the Socialist Workers' Party of Yugoslavia.

 yugoslavia.18.d:0 "After the Vukovar Congress, the newly integrated Illyrian socialists have raised the question of leadership. Trifun Kaclerović, elected as President of Serbia in 1936, has led Yugoslavia thus far, but a Slovene and Croat bloc in the Party has challenged this, stating that while his soft guiding hand has been effective thus far, him staying in power means the perpetuation of Serbian dominance. Should a united Yugoslavia not stray away from that, if it wishes to present itself as a nation for all Yugoslavs?\n\nA coalition of the Bosnian and Croat deputies have proposed Milan Gorkić - Bosnian socialist ideologue of Czech birth who was active in Habsburg-ruled Illyria before the War of Liberation. Gorkić proposes that the national question is just as important for socialist Yugoslavia as the class question. A socialist state must not be an oppressor of peoples, and must represent them - the SRPJ, in his vision, should be reorganised, establishing sub-parties for every major ethnic group, while the country itself must be turned more federal.\n\nThe Serbian faction of the Party, seeking a compromise, has proposed Moša Pijade, well known Serbian socialist writer and ideologue of Sephardic Jewish origin, who has been a key actor in proliferating socialist ideology in the Serbian republic and drafting the ideological tenets of the Serbian SRP. If elected, Pijade calls for an even stricter adherence to socialist doctrine, uniting Yugoslavia above ethnic lines and sweeping the party of "leftist errors". Finally, some can still agree to retain Trifun Kaclerović - after all, even the Croats, Slovenes and Bosniaks can respect him..."

They have increasingly begun to criticize the party leader as a right-wing deviationist whose policies have proved a failure, and a fairly capable coalition has organised around former member of the Croatian SRP, Josip Broz.\n\nBroz has too denounced Gorkić as a rightist deviationist, claiming that his focus on the national question is clearly born out of his hidden nationalist sympathies. Instead, Yugoslavia should seek to integrate all of the nationalities scattered across the Balkans into one federal, "Yugoslav" state - otherwise, it may not survive the following decades. Broz's critics have a lot of ammunition against him, however, as his dedication to socialism is not very doctrinaire, and it is suspected that if he prevails over Gorkić, he will compromise on socialist ideals such as the market economy if pragmatically necessary.\n\nAn extraordinary congress of the Party has been called in Sarajevo, and by the end of the assembly, one side in the party will surely have purged the other."
